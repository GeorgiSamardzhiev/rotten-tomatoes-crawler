It was masterfully directed by Vittorio De Sica.", "Sparse, melancholy, and strikingly real, Bicycle Thieves has the haggard, hangdog feel of a documentary, with a dramatic structure so subtle that its shattering climax almost comes as a blindside.", "This gem tells the story of a frantic search bv a man and his son for a stolen bike which provided for the family's existence. It is told with the usual Italian realism, but with unusual excitement.", "Decades later, you can see the influence of Bicycle Thieves everywhere, in a variety of genres and languages.", "It's not hyperbole to flatly state that this is one of the all-time greats in the annals of cinema; on my own list, only Ingmar Bergman's The Seventh Seal ranks higher when it comes to foreign-language films.", "It has passages of beauty and heartbreak that suggest a genuine humanism that is all too often lacking from movies whose primary goals are to thrill, excite, or otherwise distract from life itself.", "Vittorio De Sica's Bicycle Thieves is tender and immediate, a simple tale of a man whose bike is stolenwhen his job and life depends upon it.", "The Bicycle Thief does have a certain ramshackle simplicity, quietness, and even naivete that are not unwelcome as a change from the stunning noise, ingenuity, and sophistication of Hollywood.", "The work of screenwriter Cesare Zavattini, director Vittorio De Sica, the nonprofessional actors, and many others is so charged with a common purpose that there's no point in even trying to separate their achievements.", "Undeniably the most important neorealist film after Rossellini's Open City.", "...captures, in elemental strokes, the crushing of the human spirit at the hands of poverty, indifference and despair.", "[VIDEO ESSAY] Vittorio De Sica advanced Italian neorealist cinema in 1948 with a modest story about a family man trying to get back the bicycle that was stolen from him.", "De Sica carefully balances a generally tragic sensibility with a quiet undercurrent of hope, all the while sucking us into the story with the sheer urgency of the search for a stolen bicycle.", "One of the highlights of Italian Neo-realism and a landmark of humanist cinema, Vittorio de Sica's film won the best foreign language Oscar", "Enzo Staioli is an absolute revelation as son Bruno. With a mop of irrepressible hair that even a downpour of rain cannot long suppress, Bruno is a 7-year-old fellow pilgrim and witness to the joyous and heartbreaking events - the film's silent narrator.", "Bleak black-and-white classic isn't likely to interest kids."], "rating": ["", "1", "", "", "", "4/4", "", "4/4", "4/4", "4/4", "5/5", "", "", "", "4/4", "A+", "5/5", "A", "5/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Winnington", "Mike Massie", "Merl Edelman", "Robert Ellis", "Clyde Gilmour", "Matthew Lucas", "Bob Thomas", "Christy Lemire", "Matt Brunson", "James Kendrick", "Kate Muir", "William Poster", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Don Druker", "Josh Larsen", "Cole Smithey", "Hank Sartin", "Emanuel Levy", "Christopher Lloyd", "Charles Cassady"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sight and Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Free Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">California Eagle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Maclean&#39;s Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">From the Front Row", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ChristyLemire.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Q Network Film Desk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Nation", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sarasota Herald-Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media"], "date": ["February 2, 2021", "August 3, 2020", "January 24, 2020", "October 30, 2019", "October 9, 2019", "June 5, 2019", "March 29, 2019", "February 27, 2018", "April 9, 2016", "March 30, 2016", "August 13, 2015", "January 14, 2013", "January 14, 2013", "January 14, 2013", "April 1, 2012", "March 10, 2012", "November 18, 2011", "January 22, 2011", "September 27, 2010", "September 7, 2010"]}}
