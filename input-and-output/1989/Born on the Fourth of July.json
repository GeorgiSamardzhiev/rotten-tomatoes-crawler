{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the mid 1960s, suburban New York teenager Ron Kovic (Tom Cruise) enlists in the Marines, fulfilling what he sees as his patriotic duty. During his second tour in Vietnam, he accidentally kills a fellow soldier during a retreat and later becomes permanently paralyzed in battle. Returning home to an uncaring Veterans Administration bureaucracy and to people on both sides of the political divide who don't understand what he went through, Kovic becomes an impassioned critic of the war.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 24m", "director": "Oliver Stone", "studio": "IxtlanCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$68.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The eclectic and incredible cast assembled by Stone in this patriotic anti-patriot statement includes Tom Sizemore, Vivica A. Fox and James Le Gros...", "The film internalizes Cruise's acting career from beef-cake adolescent lo gung-ho patriot within the Film's plot, transforms him into a serious actor by making him at once handicapped and ugly.", "This is not the boy next door. Maybe it never was.", "The actor gives a risky, allout performance that makes him an obvious Oscar candidate. But his sacrifice is squandered. By the end of Stone's 140-minute ordeal, it becomes gruesomely clear that the movie is bereft of ideas.", "As Kovic, Tom Cruise gives a performance that is adroit, moving and mature. The devices of fiction illuminate fact, but the film gains in power because we know that it is telling a true story.", "The movie is all glib explanation... banal in its obviousness and crass in its moralizing.", "There's ultimately little doubt that Born on the Fourth of July benefits substantially from Cruise's engrossing and often electrifying turn as the tortured protagonist...", "...a tale of American masculinity undone.", "Not counting his iconic themes for such blockbusters as Star Wars and Jaws, this might feature John Williams' best music score to date.", "An exceptional feature on every level of execution, also displaying a rare sensitivity to Stone that he would spend the rest of his career trying to bury in violence and experimentation.", "Unflinching story of Vietnam vet turned activist.", "Cruise's impassioned performance as Kovic is an impressive accomplishment.", "Not the sort of movie you actually enjoy, but its thought-provoking subject matter and haunting images are not easily forgotten.", "A great performance by Cruise", "Tom Cruise, who takes Kovic from clean-cut eager teen to impassioned long-haired activist, is stunning.", "Though departing from the source material, Ron Kovic's stirring chronicle of his Vietnam experience, this film is a good companion piece to Oliver Stone's Oscar-winner Platoon, showcasing star Tom Cruise in one of his most dramatic performances.", "A compelling, elegiac film, particularly encouraging after the simplified morality of Platoon.", "Stone does populist anti-war with a passion.", "Made when Oliver Stone still had cred and Cruise wasn't a laughing stock. A fine movie.", "An overrated potboiler with effectively horrific battle scenes but a too-easy duel between good and evil father figures."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "", "", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "A", "4/5", "3/4", "", "3/5", "", "B+", "", "5/5", "4/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tom Meek", "Peter Bowen", "Otis Stuart", "Brian D.
