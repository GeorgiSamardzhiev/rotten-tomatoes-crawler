{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Judah (Martin Landau) is a philandering eye doctor who wants to preserve his marriage, and his dangerous brother Jack (Jerry Orbach) comes up with what appears to be the only viable solution. Certain that his mistress (Anjelica Huston) is about to tell his wife (Claire Bloom) about his affair, Judah agrees to Jack's murderous plan. Twinned with Judah's tale is that of Cliff Stern (Woody Allen), a documentary filmmaker whose problems, which involve love and art, are tame but funny.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Woody Allen", "studio": "JackRollinsandCharlesJoffe", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$17.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Woody Allen's writing hypnotizes me, it's no secret that he's a much better writer than director. This film has incredible reaction acting.

[Blu-ray]", "A truly brilliant study of murder and its psychological effects on the people that dare commit it.", "Using the paper-thin lead characters as symbols to show how blind people are about themselves and their relationships has little gravitas, but the comedy is stinging.", "The result is a frighteningly intelligent, and often hilariously funny whole.", "The overall 'philosophical' thrust -- that good guys finish last and that crime does pay -- is designed to make the audience feel very wise, but none of the characters or ideas is allowed to develop beyond its cardboard profile.", "Allen's expertise is evident everywhere.", "The structural and stylistic conceit is that when Landau is onscreen, the film is dead serious, even solemn, while Allen's own appearance onscreen signals hilarious satire and priceless one-liners.", "", "", "Dramatically, the film seldom fulfils its promise, and its pessimistic 'moral' -- that good and evil do not always meet with their just deserts -- looks contrived and hollow.
