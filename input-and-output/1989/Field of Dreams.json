{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When Iowa farmer Ray (Kevin Costner) hears a mysterious voice one night in his cornfield saying \"If you build it, he will come,\" he feels the need to act. Despite taunts of lunacy, Ray builds a baseball diamond on his land, supported by his wife, Annie (Amy Madigan). Afterward, the ghosts of great players start emerging from the crops to play ball, led by \"Shoeless\" Joe Jackson. But, as Ray learns, this field of dreams is about much more than bringing former baseball greats out to play.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Drama/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Sports & Fitness", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Phil Alden Robinson", "studio": "GordonCompany", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 15, 2012", "box_office": "$61.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["\"Field of Dreams\" resonated so powerfully with people wishing for a return to traditional values, plus confirmation that parallel dimensions, karma, and clairvoyance exist, that the actual movie-set field in Iowa became a major tourist attraction.", "Field of Dreams is baseball perfection.", "This is a story about passion, not just for baseball, but also a passion to do something with our one precious life even if people think it's crazy.", "It's hard to imagine a cynicism so hardened that it won't crumble at the sight of a lush green baseball field nestled into an Iowa cornfield and at this movie's final inspiring scene of youth and innocence recaptured.", "In Costner, writer-director Robinson has found the perfect player for a personal-stakes game, a guy with a leg-it-out intensity and kidlike enthusiasm. It's Costner's eye-on-the-ball exuberance that carries Dreams past its often mechanical aesthetic.", "... view baseball as much a business as a sport and can't imagine getting gushy over such mush.", "If you like to think of every time at bat as a new hope, if you can taste a kind of poetry along with the hot dogs they serve at the ballpark, if you like to imagine that life is meant to be good, and miracles aren't out of the question... go see [it].", "Rightfully a ballgame classic, this is sentimental nonsense, sure, but charmingly so.", "This fantasy drama from director Phil Alden Robinson is a delightful blend of the blind-fate story and the more fanciful feel-good corn of Frank Capra.", "Field of Dreams isn't a home run. It's more like a suicide squeeze: if it hadn't been perfectly executed, it wouldn't have worked. But as they say in baseball, a run is a run.", "Alden's script goes from charming to preposterous to preachy.", "All of this would work better if Robinson built up the reality of the town more, made the citizens a more palpable presence, as Frank Capra did in Hollywood's greatest fable-fantasy, It's a Wonderful Life.", "The sentimentality, of which there is plenty, is nicely balanced by a humor of ironic pragmatism, as when Ray, having built his baseball field as a monument to human dreams, decides to charge tourists $20 a head to visit it.", "[A] special experience, sort of an It's a Wonderful Life for the late '80s.", "Despite a lovely cameo turn by Burt Lancaster, Field of Dreams is the male weepie at its wussiest.", "Too idiosyncratic and witty merely to wallow in sentimentality, Field Of Dreams will surely stand as a classic update of what made Old Hollywood so magical. It's still a wonderful life.", "Instant baseball classic for whole family.", "Widely regarded as a modern populist classic, the film is both a fabulist fable and a celebratory baseball movie that acknowledges scandal within the sport but also the game's transcendent ability to rise above attempts to damage its integrity.
