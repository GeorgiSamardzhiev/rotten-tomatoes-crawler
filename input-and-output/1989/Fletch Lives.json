Some of the lines are funny, but after a while you just want to smack him.", "Being so sour about Fletch makes one feel like Kvetch, but seriously, is all it takes to be a screen comic the ability to flare the nostrils and to fall down?", "With arbitrary laugh lines coming along to strip the credibility from every situation and the integrity from every character, there's hardly a moment in the new film that seems as authentically alive as a California Raisins commercial.", "With the exception of an elaborate fantasy sequence straight out of a Disney movie and a running gag about a Cadillac without brakes, Fletch Lives should have been called Fletch Staggers.", "The sequel, like the original, is entertaining in a slightly stale, basically sitcomy way.", "Chase delivers a one-note performance, consisting mainly of predictable comebacks and salacious leers, while the characters who become the targets of his witty rejoinders are weak and silly stereotypes.", "Your appreciation of this film will rest largely on your taste for Chase's particular brand of snide comedy. If you like Chase, Fletch lives; if you hate Chase, Fletch dies.", "The plot, such as it is, doesn't so much revolve around Chase in a variety of ill-fitting disguises, as spin mercilessly out of control.", "This sequel to Fletch, in which Chase played novelist Gregory McDonald's Los Angeles newspaperman-detective, seems to have a chip on its shoulder, daring an audience not to laugh.", "Chevy Chase is perfectly suited to playing a smirking, wisecracking, multiple-identitied reporter in Fletch Lives.", "The mystery is barely there, and nobody really cares, as long as Chase gets to ham it up under a wider array of fake moustaches and silly accents.", "", "The humour throughout is alternately mindless, sexist, racist, and homophobic, and would probably offend if you managed to stay awake.", "A very disappointing sequel that's not nearly as funny and witty as the original.", "", "Not quite as good as the first, but still an enjoyable jaunt", "", "", ""], "rating": ["4/5", "", "2/4", "1/4", "", "3/5", "2/5", "2/4", "2/5", "", "", "2/5", "2/5", "", "2/5", "2/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Boyd Farrow", "Chris Willman", "Carrie Rickey", "Dave Kehr", "Candice Russell", "Jay Boyar", "", "Dennis King", "Sue Heal", "", "Variety Staff", "David Cornelius", "David Kaplan", "Mark Kermode", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "Emanuel Levy", "Caffeinated Clint", "Andy Klein", "Nicolas Lacroix", "Nell Minow"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">DVDTalk.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Kaplan vs. Kaplan", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fantastica Daily", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles CityBeat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EnPrimeur.ca", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Mom"], "date": ["July 1, 2015", "July 1, 2015", "July 1, 2015", "July 1, 2015", "July 1, 2015", "July 1, 2015", "July 1, 2015", "July 1, 2015", "July 1, 2015", "July 1, 2015", "March 26, 2009", "August 14, 2008", "March 1, 2008", "January 26, 2006", "October 5, 2005", "July 24, 2005", "May 6, 2005", "August 26, 2004", "January 29, 2004", "November 6, 2003"]}}
