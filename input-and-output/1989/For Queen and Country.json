{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When Reuben James (Denzel Washington), a decorated paratrooper, is discharged from the British military, he returns to his old neighborhood in London's inner city. Despite his upstanding military career, James struggles to find gainful employment in the face of racism and corruption, while navigating the crime and poverty rampant in the city. His situation only worsens when his girlfriend, Stacey (Amanda Redman), leaves him. Pushed further toward the edge, James decides to take a stand.", "rating": "31", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Martin Stellman", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2006", "box_office": "$62.8K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A jolly caper it isn't, but for gritty thrills and powerful drama, it delivers.", "Well-intentioned but overreaching.", "Effective radical agitprop, relentless in its anger, this film is more outspoken about contemporary racism in England than any other feature that comes to mind.", "Denzel Washington gives a forceful performance as the black protagonist, but the story sinks into mere cops-and-robbers melodrama after a while.", "This is a serious subject, and worthy of a serious journalistic report. That is not, however, what For Queen and Country is.", "Artfully directed and acted, For Queen & Country errs by overstating its case.", "The choice of Washington doesn't help: he isn't bad in the part, but his accent strays absurdly. More worrying is the often corny plotting, the by now tired-looking exploitation of Broadwater violence, and a preposterous shootout ending.", "Aside from the bizarre sight of Denzel Washington sporting a cockney British accent, there's not much worth recommending about For Queen and Country.", "Sadly, in trying to make a point about an unjust society, director Martin Stellman and writer Trix Worrell go disastrously overboard.", "In a terrifically subtle and powerful performance, Mr. Washington is true to the modest, struggling man he plays. His expression registers restrained anger and much confusion.", "Washington creates the character as a convincing, sympathetic person, and he deserves more than to have the character thrown away on a phoned-in plot.", "Serious-minded and foreboding -- a dark statement that might be a welcome astringent for the buttery buildup on your moviegoing palate.", "For Queen & Country is suspense-free, a laboriously paced look at the poor man's impotence in an unjust society."], "rating": ["3/5", "2/4", "", "", "2/4", "", "", "2/4", "", "3.5/5", "2/4", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "David Sterritt", "Dave Kehr", "Candice Russell", "Stephen Garrett", "David Nusair", "", "Caryn James", "Roger Ebert", "Desson Thomson", "Rita Kempley"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Sun-Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post"], "date": ["May 21, 2013", "May 21, 2013", "May 21, 2013", "May 21, 2013", "May 21, 2013", "May 21, 2013", "January 26, 2006", "July 1, 2004", "May 24, 2003", "May 24, 2003", "September 9, 2002", "September 9, 2002", "September 9, 2002"]}}
