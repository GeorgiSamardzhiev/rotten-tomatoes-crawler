{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Presented as originally released in 1939. Includes themes and character depictions which may be offensive and problematic to contemporary audiences. Epic Civil War drama focuses on the life of petulant Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara. Starting with her idyllic life on a sprawling plantation, the film traces her survival through the tragic history of the South during the Civil War and Reconstruction, and her tangled love affairs with Ashley Wilkes and Rhett Butler.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "3h 42m", "director": "Victor Fleming", "studio": "SelznickInternationalPictures", "theater_date": "Dec 15, 1939", "dvd_date": "May 19, 2016", "box_office": "$198.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One of the first technicolor films made by Hollywood, the panning shot of injured and dead soldiers littering a street remains unforgettable...", "One of the first technicolor films made by Hollywood, the panning shot of injured and dead soldiers littering a street remains unforgettable...", "No other movie has had quite the impact, the influence, or the epic feel (perhaps as only a nearly four-hour-long production could create) of this unmistakable masterpiece.", "True to the book, the film of Gone With The Wind is held together by its heroine.", "\"Hey kids, wanna watch a four-hour-long romantic melodrama, told from the sympathetic perspective of the racist slave owners who lost the Civil War?\"", "Victor Fleming's direction has abundant artistic successes. [Full review in Spanish]", "In casting Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara, Clark Gable as RhettButler, Olivia De Havilland as Melanie and Leslie Howard as Ashley Wilkes, [David O. Selznick] brought the major characters to life just as they existed in the book.", "Miss Mitchell used 475,000 words to tell her story. Three hours 45 minutes is not a second too long in which to recount it in the film transcription.", "Clark Gable sends a refreshing blast of cynicism through a narrative which otherwise would have been over-sweet.", "This danger-fraught material should be left to inspired writers... Mediocre reactionary writers shouldn't play around with so much dynamite for the mere sake of giving the sensation-loving masses a thrill.", "The only help we can give [a future researcher] is to explain that the burning question of our day was not a question of the value of this work as a piece of historic documentation: our public was concerned chiefly with the techniques of histrionic art.", "It's corny and blowsy and phony, the slide trombone in the cinematic orchestra, and yet it is not boring.", "I enjoy watching it but I acknowledge all those flaws.", "\"Gone With the Wind\" offers the kind of big, rich, opulent experience the movies are in a unique position to offer but seldom do.", "For anyone older who wants a reminiscent trip into the early war years, and how it felt to look at someone else's high-coloured war when you had no idea what your own was bringing, again this is it.", "There is a kind of dispassionate confidence in the film's own destiny: the last tycoon, making the last of the dinosaurs.", "If the story had been cut short and tidied up at the point marked by the interval, and if the personal drama had been made subservient to a cinematic treatment of the central theme, then Gone With the Wind might have been a really great film.", "I was swept away by the drama about a selfish, beautiful Southern belle who loses everything in the Civil War but claws her way back after vowing - backed by composer Max Steiner's trumpets - \"As God is my witness, I'll never be hungry again.\"", "Now it can be told that out of the pages of a magnificent book has leaped a magnificent motion picture.", "I still find the movie vile and offensive in every important part.
