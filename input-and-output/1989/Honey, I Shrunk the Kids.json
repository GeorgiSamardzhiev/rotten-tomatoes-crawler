{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When kids sneak into inventor Wayne Szalinski's (Rick Moranis) upstairs lab to retrieve an errant baseball, his experimental shrink ray miniaturizes them. When Szalinski returns home, he destroys the device -- which he thinks is a failure -- and dumps it in the trash, throwing out the kids along with it. The four children, now 1/4-inch tall, must survive the journey back to the house through a yard where sprinklers bring treacherous storms and garden-variety ants stampede like elephants.", "rating": "77", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Joe Johnston", "studio": "WaltDisneyPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 27, 2016", "box_office": "$130.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...a fantastic premise that's employed to watchable yet thoroughly erratic effect...", "Like a Ray Harryhausen film for children, the consistently light tone allows the dangerous odyssey to remain fun, not frightening.", "Using as many practical effects as possible, as well as the special effects of the day, director Joe Johnston's vision holds up incredibly well years later.", "Not great.
