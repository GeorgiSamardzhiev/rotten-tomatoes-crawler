{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Samantha Hughes (Emily Lloyd) lives with her uncle, Emmett Smith (Bruce Willis), in a small Kentucky town. After her high school graduation, she decides not to join her mother, Irene (Joan Allen), in Lexington, but instead stays with Emmett, whose mental and physical health have been affected by his experiences in the Vietnam War. Samantha's father, Dwayne (Daniel Jenkins), died in Vietnam before she was born, and she hopes to learn more about him from her traumatized uncle.", "rating": "68", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h", "director": "Norman Jewison", "studio": "WarnerBros.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 11, 2015", "box_office": "$3.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Filmmaker Norman Jewison does a nice job of establishing the small town (and its myriad of denizens) in which Lloyd's affable character resides...", "There's a decency about this movie that's almost palpable. It's not trying to pump us up with false jingoism or the sins of the past. Jewison, a Canadian, probably approaches the entire subject with a mediatory mood.", "In essence, In Country is a well-turned variation on the quest to find a father that shows up in the folk tales of almost any culture.", "Jewison manipulates the audience's familiarity with this national monument to achieve the kind of dramatic pitch that the characters themselves could not attain.", "Unfortunately, the last half-hour slides into the weepiest sort of sentimentality.", "The scene at the memorial is one of the film's best, but director Jewison fails to find in it anything close to the level of emotional force that the same scene in Mason's book has.", "This is no tribute to the war dead, but an unthinking betrayal of them -- they've been drafted again, this time to supply a climax to a second-rate tearjerker.", "Sounds like your basic TV movie, sunk by noble intentions. But here well meaning translates into well done.", "Lloyd, though technically adept, doesn't really get under her conflicted character's skin; the supporting actors (including Willis) are the film's greatest strength.", "Norman Jewison usually is a commanding storyteller, but In Country is a film with two stories that fail to add up to something greater.", "Gripping performances save this post-Vietnam drama", "", "Jewison's post-Vietnam movie concentrates on bereavement, with the consequence that it's decent but dull.", "A profoundly moving tearjerker about the festering wounds caused by the Vietnam War in middle America. A young Emily Lloyd is absolutely wonderful.", "", "Willis is brilliant as a 'Nam veteran", "An overlooked and underrated drama with Willis giving one of his finest performances.", "A powerful drama about one American family's attempt to release the grief and pain caused by the Vietnam war", "Jewison manages to save up all the emotion for the charged conclusion at the Vietnam memorial in Washington, but it's a case of too little, too late.", "In Country means to capture the deep tragedy at the center of pedestrian lives. Instead, it becomes a pedestrian film."], "rating": ["2/4", "3/5", "3/4", "2.5/4", "", "3/5", "2/4", "", "2.5/4", "", "4/5", "3/5", "", "5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Nusair", "Michael Wilmington", "Desmond Ryan", "Gary Thompson", "David Sterritt", "Jay Boyar", "Dave Kehr", "", "", "Variety Staff", "Carol Cling", "Susan Granger", "Geoff Andrew", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "Emanuel Levy", "Lori Hoffman", "Bob Bloom", "Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat", "", "Caryn James"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Las Vegas Review-Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">www.susangranger.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fantastica Daily", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Atlantic City Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Journal and Courier (Lafayette, IN)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spirituality &amp; Practice", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times"], "date": ["January 13, 2019", "May 7, 2013", "May 7, 2013", "May 7, 2013", "May 7, 2013", "May 7, 2013", "May 7, 2013", "September 16, 2009", "September 16, 2009", "September 16, 2009", "June 16, 2006", "April 8, 2006", "February 9, 2006", "October 6, 2005", "August 14, 2005", "April 27, 2005", "July 30, 2004", "July 19, 2003", "May 24, 2003", "May 20, 2003"]}}
