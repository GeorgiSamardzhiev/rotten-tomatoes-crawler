{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This unconventional Canadian film focuses on an acting troupe hired to stage a Passion play about the life of Jesus. Led by Daniel (Lothaire Bluteau), the actors, all struggling with their own issues, work on a bold interpretation of the Biblical tale that challenges accepted Christian thinking and brings a burst of outrage from the Roman Catholic priests who recruited them. As the story progresses, Daniel's life starts to echo the trials of Jesus in unexpected and poignant ways.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "Denys Arcand", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 9, 2004", "box_office": "$20.4K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "Denys Arcand made this original movie, in which life imitates art, at the peak of his career, right after Decline of the American Empire.", "", "Bluteau has taken his Daniel too seriously, Daniel has taken his Jesus too seriously, and Arcand&#8217;s resolute detachment brings the whole conception down.", "", "", "", "", "", "Inventive, witty, illuminating: about a contemporary staging of the Passion play, the institutional church's reverence for the status quo, & the false gods of secularism.", "It's an original and uncompromising attempt to explore what really might happen, if the spirit of Jesus were to walk among us in these timid and materialistic times.", "", "", ""], "rating": ["C-", "B+", "3/5", "2/5", "4/5", "5/5", "4/5", "3/5", "5/5", "", "3.5/4", "4.5/5", "9/10", "C-"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Owen Gleiberman", "Emanuel Levy", "Cole Smithey", "Jake Euker", "Nicolas Lacroix", "Rob Blackwelder", "Oz", "Philip Martin", "Kevin N.
