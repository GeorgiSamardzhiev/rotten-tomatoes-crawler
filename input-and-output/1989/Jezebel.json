{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In one of her most renowned roles, Bette Davis portrays Julie Marsden, a spoiled Southern belle who risks losing her suitor with her impetuous behavior. Engaged to successful banker Preston Dillard (Henry Fonda), Julie pushes him away with her arrogant and contrary ways, leading to a scandalous scene at a major social event and his subsequent departure. When Preston eventually returns and Julie attempts to win him back, she discovers that it may be too late.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "William Wyler", "studio": "WarnerBros.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 5, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Even the historical backdrop - primarily with the paranoia, death, and destruction from the yellow jack epidemic - are no match for Davis' fiery persona.", "Bette Davis, more restrained than usual, sometimes subtle, and none-the-less powerful, does the wilful Southern belle to a crisp.", "Does Jezebel chart Bette Davis' redemption, or punishment?", "Bette Davis' extraordinary intensity almost makes one believe in Julie's Jezebel-Nurse Cavell personality.", "The immortal 1950 masterpiece All About Eve is the movie that houses Bette Davis' best performance, but certainly ranking in the top five would be her mesmerizing turn in this Civil War-era melodrama.", "The film's success is wrapped around Davis' steely performance and the elegant production values", "A tottering costume drama that gave Bette Davis one of her rare non-bitchy roles.
