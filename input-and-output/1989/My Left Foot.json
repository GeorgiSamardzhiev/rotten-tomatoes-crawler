{"metadata": {"synopsis": "No one expects much from Christy Brown (Daniel Day-Lewis), a boy with cerebral palsy born into a working-class Irish family. Though Christy is a spastic quadriplegic and essentially paralyzed, a miraculous event occurs when, at the age of 5, he demonstrates control of his left foot by using chalk to scrawl a word on the floor. With the help of his steely mother (Brenda Fricker) -- and no shortage of grit and determination -- Christy overcomes his infirmity to become a painter, poet and author.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Jim Sheridan", "studio": "GranadaTelevision", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 21, 2016", "box_office": "$14.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The story is consistently eye-opening, moving, and utterly engaging.", "It's the kind of role that showoff stars leap at. Luckily for the film and us, an actor got there first.", "It is a spellbinding journey.", "It's Day-Lewis who lights up the screen most brilliantly.", "[Jim Sheridan's] inconspicuous but affecting direction filters through the well-drawn characters (played by a uniformly brilliant cast).", "You may not want to see My Left Foot, fearing that it will be too harrowing and possibly too sentimental. There are times when it is both, but take courage and see it if you can, because it is one of the most remarkable films of the year.", "Gritty yet uplifting tale of artist with cerebral palsy.", "Despite fine performances from Daniel Day-Lewis and Brenda Fricker, My Left Foot is a middling biopic that takes a rather superficial look at the extraordinary life of Christy Brown, never daring to go deeper into what made him tick.", "A fairly generic biopic with an amazing turn by Daniel Day-Lewis.", "Deviating from the standard Hollywood biopic, Sheridan's chronicle told with candor, realism, and humor the story of paraplegic writer-artist Christy Brown, embodied in a tour-de-force Oscar-winning performance by Daniel Day-Lewis.", "All performances are on the mark in this perfect little film.", "[The film] leaves one with an overwhelming sense of the miraculousness of life and of this man's spirit.", "Even if all My Left Foot had to offer was Day-Lewis's performance, it'd be a must-see movie.", "For all his character's travails the film as a whole winds up surprisingly upbeat.", "Nothing can detract from the power of this film, especially Daniel Day-Lewis' astonishing performance as Christy Brown.", "", "Day Lewis' re-creation of writer/painter Christy Brown's condition is so precise, so detailed and so matter-of-fact that it transcends the carping about casting an actor without cerebral palsy.", "Daniel Day-Lewis gives a startling, dazzling performance.", "", "Much of the pricelessness of My Left Foot comes from Daniel Day-Lewis's spot-on portrayal of Brown, the first acting job that made critics and awards voters really take notice of him."], "rating": ["8/10", "", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "3/5", "3/4", "A", "", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Peter Travers", "Sheila Benson", "David Sterritt", "Bruce C.
