{"metadata": {"synopsis": "As the holidays approach, Clark Griswold (Chevy Chase) wants to have a perfect family Christmas, so he pesters his wife, Ellen (Beverly D'Angelo), and children, as he tries to make sure everything is in line, including the tree and house decorations. However, things go awry quickly. His hick cousin, Eddie (Randy Quaid), and his family show up unplanned and start living in their camper on the Griswold property. Even worse, Clark's employers renege on the holiday bonus he needs.", "rating": "68", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Jeremiah S.

Happily, this film is a lot funnier than expected, too.", "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation is a non-stop laugh riot, with extremely memorable moments, beautiful cinematography, and a heartwarming story at its core.", "National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation isn't the finest Xmas movie you'll ever see, but it's disarmingly heartfelt at times, and the over-the-top extravaganzas (like the house lights you could probably see from space) epitomize Christmas.", "In National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, Chevy Chase's family Christmas tree is a little full with a lot of sap, much like this movie. But it's a big-hearted fullness and it's a smoothly stirred sap.", "[A] fairly perfect blend... of cartoon violence and mayhem and the pleasant lightness of a Christmas movie.", "John Hughes wrote the screenplay for this silly, warm little guilty pleasure that nails most of the trials and tribulations of spending the holidays with family.", "With enough sight gags to please slapstick fans and enough good-natured Christmas cheer to qualify as a good holiday film, National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation should keep most viewers occupied and provide 97 minutes of goofy entertainment.", "Solid family fare with plenty of yocks.", "Easily the funniest of the four Vacation movies.
