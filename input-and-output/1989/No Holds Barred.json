Hogan himself has an appealing screen presence -- like a gallant teddy bear who goes berserk every 10 minutes or so.", "Maybe we should mention that the gruesome violence in the movie was enough to make this adult wince.", "The final showdown between Rip and Zeus is overlong and full of uninspired wrestling stunts. The camera crews of the World Wrestling Federation do a much better job.", "For months now, Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro have been sitting in their dens and nervously clutching their Oscars. They knew that an unprecedented challenge was looming... the arrival of Hulk Hogan in his first starring role in a movie.", "While wrestling fans surely will queue up to see their boy win the day, No Holds Barred is just a sweaty headlock of a film, with dreary, gory scenes and a bunch of slope-headed hokum to propel it.", "Some may find the cartoonish violence excessive; the champion Tough Guy can't be anyone but a good guy, but that doesn't stop him from doling out to his enemies a very painful punishment.", "The film is utterly lacking in the campy quality of the World Wrestling Federation telecasts.", "Barred is tremendously crude, unapologetically manipulative (Zeus finally breaks down Rip's reserve by crippling his kid brother), and aimed directly at easily entertained 13-year-old boys.", "", "No Brains Involved", "", "Try: No Holds Suck. Tiny Lister is awesome, but -- apart from The Scorpion King, The Princess Bride and The One and Only -- all movies involving 'wrestlers' are stupid.", "", "As cartoonish as its star.", "", "Hogan is obviously trying for the Arnold Schwarzenegger musclebound movie crown, but Schwarzenegger need have no fears.
