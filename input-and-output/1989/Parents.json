{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Ten-year-old Michael Laemle (Bryan Madorsky) senses that something is not quite right with his family. Sure, his mother, Lily (Mary Beth Hurt), is the perfect 1950s housewife, and they have a comfortable life in the suburbs, where his dad, Nick (Randy Quaid), works at a mortuary. But what's with the enormous cuts of meat that his father brings home every night? What, or whom, do they come from? Michael takes his concerns to a school counselor (Sandy Dennis) who decides to come over for dinner.", "rating": "53", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Horror", "runtime": "1h 22m", "director": "Bob Balaban", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$464.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Parents is not for the squeamish.

The only reaction it will likely not instill is nonchalance.", "", "", "", "Pretty clever thriller that's about half as smart as it thinks it is.", "", "", "", "", "Because it speaks to a terror that lurks deep within our memories, Parents has the potential to be a great horror film.
