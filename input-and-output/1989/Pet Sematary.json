After the Creeds' cat is accidentally killed, Crandall advises Louis to bury it in the ground near the old pet cemetery. The cat returns to life, its personality changed for the worse. When Louis' son, Gage (Miko Hughes), dies tragically, Louis decides to bury the boy's body in the same ground despite the warnings of Crandall and Louis' visions of a deceased patient.", "rating": "51", "genre": "Horror", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "Mary Lambert", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Pet Sematary quickly becomes a testament to the power of the female gaze on screen, as well as Mary Lambert's considerable skills as a director. None of the gore is exploitative, and even the death of a child is handled with empathy and respect.", "Reduced to its plot outlines, King`s work no longer functions; its meaning lies in the obscure tensions and anxieties that shape the fantasy, not in what happens, but why.", "King turns the mirror on humanity, questioning our faith, our belief, our methods of expelling grief from our lives. And it isn't always a pretty sight.", "Overall, the acting in Pet Sematary is hit or miss. But when it hits, it's a bullseye.", "One of the stodgier King adaptations of its period, Pet Sematary 1989 squanders much of its promise with cardboard performances, flat direction and a dire lack of both emotional heft and chilly mood.", "The premise is fascinating, but the leaden direction, weak performances from the leads, and King's frequently campy interludes pretty much sink this one.", "Some genuinely great scares... Fred Gwynne completely and utterly steals the show.", "While this is one of the best King adaptations, it does have some pacing issues, especially in the middle. The story drags a bit, but by the third act everything is moving at a breakneck pace.", "Pet Sematary kicked off something new: the modest, micro, highly enjoyable King adaptation.", "...a misbegotten adaptation that could (and should) have been so much better...", "As a metaphor for the terrible decisions people make and never learn, Pet Sematary maintains a building sense of dread.", "This a silly movie, also overwrought, fusing the two until it approaches something grand and gonzo and tragic and meaningful.", "Without any real scares, there's no reason at all for this movie to exist.", "A silly and tedious horror drama...", "It bombs despite King adapting the screenplay from his novel.", "a flawed, but still bracingly horrific film of ideas, one that maintains with substantial impact the novel's tragic themes about death and the limitations of human control", "...one of the most witless horror movies I've sat through, essentially a zombie ghost story that's wholly predictable throughout.", "Haunting, sorrowful and reverberatingly eerie. Above all, Pet Sematary is a remarkably mature and thought-provoking look at the mysterious nature of death and the complexity of the grieving process.", "Typically creepy Stephen King fodder.", "A true-blue bruise of a horror flick, packed with unsettling images, shocking demises, and a wonderfully apt sense of macabre humor."], "rating": ["4/5", "2/4", "4.5/5", "", "2.5/5", "2/4", "7/10", "", "", "2/4", "", "", "1.5/5", "", "C", "3/4", "4/10", "4/4", "3/5", "4.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Sez\u00edn Koehler", "Dave Kehr", "C.H.
