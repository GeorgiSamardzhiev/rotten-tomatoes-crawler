{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Wally Karue (Richard Pryor) is a blind man looking for a job. Dave Lyons (Gene Wilder) is a deaf man who runs a newsstand. When Dave hires Wally, he never imagines they'll have to work together to survive. After a murder occurs at their newsstand, they figure out who the killer is with their collective senses -- but the investigating detective (Alan North) pegs them as the main suspects. When the real killer (Joan Severance) returns to cover her tracks, the two must really cooperate to live.", "rating": "28", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Arthur Hiller", "studio": "TriStarPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$45.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["And while it's not lightning this movie captures, it does generate more than the regular output of high-concept wattage usually expected from such calculated, commercial comedies.", "The film is great entertainment.", "This dubious concept might have worked if someone had written something funny for either comic actor to say.", "\"No Evil, Hear No Evil\" leaves us hoping we haven't seen the of Wally and Dave.", "This tasteless, formulaic, mainly unfunny, but otherwise harmless romp was scripted by five people and is served up like meat and potatoes by hack director Arthur Hiller.", "The movie mostly flows easily, though, to its satisfying conclusion.", "As well as being an original comic talent, Richard Pryor has also had the dubious distinction of appearing in a plethora of truly execrable movies, and this is certainly one of them.", "The credits for 'See No Evil, Hear No Evil' show that there were five scriptwriters (including Wilder himself). What on earth were they all doing?", "The plot is far from inspired.", "''See No Evil'' lurches from hip callousness to damp sentimentality.", "[Pryor and Wilder], who haven't always been successful in their solo film work, seem to inspire each other in their joint ventures, and See No Evil, Hear No Evil generates more laughs than their recent films.", "Lowbrow comedy at its worst, See No Evil, Hear No Evil is full of cheap disability jokes, stupid car chases, and boring shootouts, and none of it is very entertaining.", "It is, let's face it, scarcely a movie at all.
