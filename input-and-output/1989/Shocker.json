{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After being captured for a series of gruesome murders, Horace Pinker (Mitch Pileggi), a television repairman, faces execution by the electric chair -- but a deal with the devil allows him to come back as electricity. Once he changes into his new form, Pinker goes after the detective that brought him down, Lt. Don Parker (Michael Murphy), as well as Parker's adopted son, Jonathan (Peter Berg). However, Jonathan's mysterious connection to Pinker through dreams might help track the killer's moves.", "rating": "24", "genre": "Comedy/Horror/Mystery & Suspense/Television", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Wes Craven", "studio": "AliveFilms,CarolcoPicturesInc.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 11, 2015", "box_office": "$15.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's interesting to note that Shocker boasts an opening stretch that hardly hints at the off-the-wall craziness that's to come...", "Like a frenzied fever dream fueled by the power of righteous heavy metal, Wes Craven's Shocker is certainly one of his more oddball cult classics, an amalgam of his most ambitious ideas & a viciously wild visual style.", "The notion that television regularly delivers violence into America's living rooms is literalized in this thoroughly wick-wick-wack but distinctive satire-chiller.", "Shocker ranks among Craven's absolute worst, with his attempt to create another enduring villain like A Nightmare on Elm Street's Freddy Krueger falling woefully flat.", "Shocker is more over-the-top goofy than scary, but it's a good deal of fun and the special effects hold up pretty well after a quarter century.", "If \"Shocker\" careens off its rails, however, Craven's puppet-master command behind the scenes remains in evidence; his direction is never in doubt, even when shreds of his script are.", "Shocker represents a low point (perhaps the lowest point) in the career of horror master Wes Craven.
