An incisive, nontitillating female gaze on sexual abuse that never sensationalizes horror.", "Directed with both sensitivity and brio, this gripping and haunting drama gets to the heart of the power that abusers hold over their victims.", "Memorable mostly for a finely-shaded and committed performance from relative newcomer No\u00e9e Abita.", "At times, it can seem like a well-made TV dramatisation. But director Charl\u00e8ne Favier adds constant depth, unpicking the whole precarious dynamic of mentors and mentees.", "With a restrained screenplay and incredible central performance from No\u00e9e Abita, filmmaker Charl\u00e8ne Favier presents a powerful, moving account of sexual abuse in professional skiing.", "The grey area between passionately committed teaching and abuse is a familiar topic. Yet the film ingeniously merges it with the ambiguous experience of slalom ski-ing...", "What makes Slalom more than a mere movie of the week is how it remains, from start to finish, an engrossingly subjective account of ambivalence and abuse...", "While Favier avoids skiing down all the predictable slopes and maintains a narrative poise, which surprises considering the subject matter, these are indeed chilly scenes of a winter oft repeated and normalized across every culture and climate.", "If Lyz can find a way to be proud of herself, that might prove to be the most lasting victory of all.", "Well-made, perceptively performed and deeply enraging, it's a difficult but necessary watch...", "Nothing is cut and dried on the emotional front and that's what renders the story anything but mundane."], "rating": ["4/5", "4.5", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3/5", "", "3.5/5", "B+", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Simran Hans", "MaryAnn Johanson", "Christopher Machell", "David Jenkins", "Danny Leigh", "Nikki Baughan", "Peter Bradshaw", "Jordan Mintzer", "Nicholas Bell", "David Ehrlich", "Jessica Kiang", "Lisa Nesselson"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Observer (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flick Filosopher", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Little White Lies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Financial Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">indieWire", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen International"], "date": ["February 13, 2021", "February 13, 2021", "February 12, 2021", "February 12, 2021", "February 10, 2021", "February 9, 2021", "February 9, 2021", "July 9, 2020", "July 2, 2020", "June 29, 2020", "June 25, 2020", "June 22, 2020"]}}
