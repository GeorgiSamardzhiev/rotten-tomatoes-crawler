But, don't go thinking this is a guilty pleasure. \"Re-Animator\" was a vastly superior film.", "Putting a fist up America's hidden dynastic structures & pulling them inside out so that the terrible things underneath are revealed for all to see, Society is a veritable orgy of influences assimilated into something singular & entirely sui generis.", "", "Although Society is at first blemished by its dated humor and contrived teenage self-discovery, we find everything is in service to a truly sensational ending.", "An attempt to make a different movie.
