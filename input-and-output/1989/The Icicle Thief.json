{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A cheeky satire of television and an ode to Italian neo-realist films, this playful movie features director Maurizio Nichetti playing himself. The filmmaker becomes distressed when one of his classic black-and-white movies airs on TV and is frequently interrupted by gaudy color commercials. As the film and the ads begin to overlap, and the movie's characters attempt to leave their tragic situations for consumer bliss, Nichetti enters the television world to try and sort things out.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 24m", "director": "Maurizio Nichetti", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "Charming and inventive.", "", "", "Offers a clever look at the media and its impact on our lives", "", "Uma comdia cada vez mais rara nos dias de hoje: inteligente, tocante e, claro, muito divertida.", ""], "rating": ["2/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Emanuel Levy", "Rich Cline", "Carol Cling", "", "Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat", "Jeffrey Westhoff", "Pablo Villa\u00e7a", "Mark R.
