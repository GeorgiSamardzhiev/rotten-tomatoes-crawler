{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Professor Sinigaglia (Marcello Mastroianni) is the title character in this darkly comedic Italian drama about mistreated factory workers in the city of Turin. Toiling away in appalling conditions in a textile mill, these employees have no one to stand up for them until Sinigaglia puts his academic career on the line by helping them to start a strike. Although the teacher comes under scrutiny by unsympathetic authorities, he maintains his dedication to the workers' cause.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "2h 6m", "director": "Mario Monicelli", "studio": "LuxFilmS.p.a.,VidesCinematografica,AvalaFilm", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 24, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["That someone should have thought to cast Marcello Mastroianni as a seedy, itinerant, and slightly visionary nineteenth century labor organizer -- in The Organizer -- marks the triumph of a certain misapprehension.", "With a great script, imaginative still-photo montage, and a roving camera, director Mario Monticelli creates a very rewarding ninety minutes.", "Marcello Mastroianni is superb in still another new kind of role. With delicacy and restraint he fills in the outlines of a rather complex man, who is personally gentle, humane and inept but ruthlessly efficient as a professional troublemaker.", "A nearly forgotten near-great movie, with one of Marcello Mastroianni's classic tragicomic performances.", "Shot on location, the movie has a neo-realistic feel, but sometimes the framing of the shots gives it a beautiful cinematic vibe that is far from gritty, despite its subject matter.", "The style often features broad comic performances against a background of despair and defeatism; these were not comedies with happy endings which seems to be a contradiction.", "Maybe you wouldn't expect a two hour Italian film about a strike in a Turin textile factory at the end of the 19th century to be especially entertaining.
