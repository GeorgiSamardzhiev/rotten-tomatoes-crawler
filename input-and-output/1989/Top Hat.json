This has been said before - possibly in this column - but that isn't any good reason for not saying it again.", "While personally I didn't think it was quite so swell as The Gay Divorcee or Roberta, it is still about ten times better than am musical that hasn't got Fred Astaire in it. The man is a maniac when he starts to dance.", "Most of what I liked about Top Hat centers around its two stars: full of energy and grace, they breathe life into the film whenever it threatens to lose its luster.", "Arguably the classiest and funniest of the RKO Astaire-Rogers musicals.", "If you want only one Astaire-Rogers musical, Top Hat is obligatory.", "Finally, thanks more to Fred Astaire than any other single influence, the character of musicomedy in the cinema has now completely changed.", "The fourth pairing of Astaire-Rogers is one of their best and RKO top grosser of the year.", "This one can't miss and the reasons are three -- Fred Astaire, Irving Berlin's 11 songs and sufficient comedy between numbers to hold the film together.", "This 1935 musical finds Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers at the top of their form.", "", "Top Hat does not glorify wealth or upper class status - if anything it continually pokes fun at it.", "The third Astaire-Rogers movie and one of the best.", "Because we are bound by gravity and the limitations of our bodies, because we live in a world where the news is often bad and the prospects disturbing, there is a need for another world somewhere, a world where Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers live.", "The plot is involving, especially as it builds to its seemingly impossible-to-solve finale.", "...even after seventy years, the same elements delight us all over again.
