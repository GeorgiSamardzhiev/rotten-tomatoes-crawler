{"metadata": {"synopsis": "With her marriage breaking up, Beverly Hills housewife Phyllis Nefler (Shelley Long) boosts her self-esteem by leading a local troop of Wilderness Girls. Although Phyllis' version of roughing it is spending the night at the Beverly Hills Hotel, that suits her privileged troop members just fine. Unfortunately, when Phyllis falls afoul of a rival leader, the girls are threatened with having their group dissolved -- unless they can prove their wilderness skills at the annual jamboree.", "rating": "25", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Jeff Kanew", "studio": "WeintraubEntertainmentGroup", "theater_date": "Mar 22, 1989", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$7.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A misunderstood camp classic. The costumes alone deserve an oscar not to mention Shelley Long's performance", "It's cookie time! This childhood favorite stands the test of time with a fabulous performance by Shelly Long, iconic costumes, and a lot of heart!", "Troop Beverly Hills thoughtfully exposes the complexities of divorce, social/class culture and personal growth in a light comedy very much loyal to its time.", "Stereotypes, silliness reign in uneven parody of rich girls.", "...the film eventually does wear out its welcome due primarily to its wildly uneven structure and Jeff Kanew's ostentatiously '80s directorial choices.", "", "", "She left Cheers for this?!?", "Troop Beverly Hills is a fizzled farce...lightweight and inconsequential to boot. Clearly, it's about as comically crunchy as a box of smashed girl scout cookies", "It's a treat (and necessity) not only for youngish gay boys, but for anyone who enjoys campy good fun with the added bonus of watching dominant cultural values self-destruct.", "", "Not how I'd choose to spend the evening.", "", "", "Dreadful as their performances are, the actors are the victims.", "Instead of being a merciless evisceration of the lifestyles of the rich, it's a little morality play in which Long transforms herself into a warm and useful person.
