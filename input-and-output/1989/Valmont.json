{"metadata": {"synopsis": "French novel \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\", by Choderlos de Laclos.

But it runs out of inspiration long before it runs out of plot twists.", "Insufficiently racy in tone as well as pacing, this accomplished but bland costume drama is Dangerous Liaisons' poor cousin.", "The effect is like an ermine violin: It is beautiful to look at, but it doesn't play.", "The anachronistic brio which distinguishes Forman's style is in pleasurable evidence, the approach to the subject is very much his own, and it's worth seeing if you forget all about the original.", "Because there are no characters animating his panorama, all this serves to prove is that though Forman's movie is broader than Frears', it is also shallower.", "Valmont plays like a period sex romp, its concerns reduced to the level of who sleeps with whom and who gets dumped.", "While Frears's is truer to the calculating spirit of the book and has the showier cast, Forman's has greater human interest and the more heartfelt performances.", "What keeps the film interesting, if not riveting, is the generally on target casting and resulting topnotch interpretations.", "", "", "It's a warm, energetic, humorous film, with some excellent ensemble playing; but the cruelty and psychological complexity are lost, and the ensuing tragedy has little resonance.", "", "Just as good as that other one, maybe better.", "Nice try, but Glenn, John and Michelle did it much better"], "rating": ["", "1.5/4", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "1/4", "3/5", "2/4", "2/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "3/5", "", "3/5", "4/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Harriet Waugh", "Gary Thompson", "Sheila Benson", "Dave Kehr", "Richard Schickel", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "David Sterritt", "Jon Fortgang", "Roger Hurlburt", "", "Carrie Rickey", "", "David Parkinson", "Variety Staff", "Cole Smithey", "Susan Granger", "Dominic Wells", "Emanuel Levy", "Gregory Weinkauf", "James Sanford"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">www.susangranger.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Kalamazoo Gazette"], "date": ["July 20, 2018", "February 9, 2015", "February 9, 2015", "February 9, 2015", "February 9, 2015", "February 9, 2015", "February 9, 2015", "February 9, 2015", "February 9, 2015", "February 9, 2015", "February 9, 2015", "February 9, 2015", "February 9, 2015", "May 20, 2008", "November 30, 2007", "October 29, 2007", "January 26, 2006", "November 23, 2004", "October 22, 2003", "July 15, 2003"]}}
