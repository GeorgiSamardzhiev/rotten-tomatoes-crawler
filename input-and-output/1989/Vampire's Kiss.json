{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The life of white-collar New Yorker Peter (Nicolas Cage) seems to revolve solely around making as much money and sleeping with as many women as possible. After a typical night of scouring trendy bars for some action, Peter manages to take home the sexy Rachel (Jennifer Beals), who bites him on the neck while they're in bed. The next day, Peter is certain he is now a vampire. Though no one shares his point of view and he hasn't changed physically, he dons fake fangs and begins stalking women.", "rating": "61", "genre": "Comedy/Horror", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "Robert Bierman", "studio": "MagellanPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$96.7K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A vampire satire with real bite.", "As Vampire's Kiss unspools, the lead character, Peter Loew (Cage), wavers in and out of this accent and a wide variety of voices, seeming to give every role Cage has ever played (or would ever play, past, present and future) equal vocal time in the film.", "100-minute-long piece of performance art masquerading as a moody, silly indie switchblade. Rarely impresses, succumbing to overwhelmingly sluggish filmmaking decisions and a permissive attitude that robs the picture of its...well...bite.", "An odd blend of bitter comedy and genuine horror.", "Problem is that Cage's over-the-top performance generates little sympathy for the character, so it's tough to be interested in him as his personality disorder worsens.", "What truly distinguishes the movie is Cage's performance, which is so off the wall that even if you don't like it you have to watch in awe.", "What really makes this worth seeing is Cage's outrageously unbridled performance.", "", "For pure, undiluted Cage-osity, Vampire's Kiss is the film to beat.", "Undeservedly dismissed by most critics, this original film, whether taken as a straight horror yarn or as a psycho-erotic nightmare, mixes elements of fable and satire in a startling manner.", "Bierman's striking first feature leaves one trembling between corrosive laughter, edgy terror, and a residual sadness at Loew's pitiful plight.", "", "A strange movie but a breakout role for Cage.", "Kooky vampire flick gives us an already neurotic Nicolas Cage slowly turning into one of them after receiving a bite.", "The film is dominated and destroyed by Mr. Cage's chaotic, self-indulgent performance.", "Simply a bad movie.", "", "This is a flick for which I had very fond memories from back in the day, but watching it again after all these years, I can't say that it was as great as I once remembered it.", "", ""], "rating": ["", "5/10", "C", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "5/5", "B", "", "4/5", "3/5", "3.5/5", "2/5", "4", "2/5", "7/10", "2/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Eleanor Ringel Cater", "J.C.
