{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This experimental film synthesizes the poetry of Wilfred Owen, wordless reenactments of events from Owen's life, stock footage of 20th-century wars and music by composer Benjamin Britten. During World War I, British soldier Owen (Nathaniel Parker) is mortified by the examples of cruelty that surround him in the trenches. He combats these terrifying images by maintaining hope in his love for an army nurse (Tilda Swinton). But he also begins to accept his fate as another battlefield sacrifice.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Art House & International/Documentary/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 25m", "director": "Derek Jarman", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 13, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["War Requiem, with its firm imposition of formal structures and disciplines, is among the best things [Jarman] has ever done.", "A stunning visual film that's combined with the spectacular interpretation of composer Benjamin Britten's 1961 orchestral and oratorio masterpiece.", "Like nearly all of Derek Jarman's films, his War Requiem is an uneven work where it's often easier to admire what was attempted more than what was actually achieved.", "", "The rhythm of the images attunes the viewer to the music's components.", ""], "rating": ["", "A", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jonathan Keates", "Dennis Schwartz", "Ken Hanke", "Emanuel Levy", "Douglas Pratt", ""], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sight and Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">DVDLaser", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide"], "date": ["January 16, 2020", "April 28, 2012", "November 5, 2008", "September 25, 2005", "November 6, 2004", "July 30, 2003"]}}
