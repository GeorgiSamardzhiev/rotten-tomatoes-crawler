{"metadata": {"synopsis": "With his guardian angel (Ray Sharkey) and reporter Bob Woodward (J.T. Walsh), comedian John Belushi (Michael Chiklis) reviews his short, fast life.", "rating": "4", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Larry Peerce", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$681.1K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A good portion of the film's stroll down memory lane attempts to recreate some of the Belushi-Dan Aykroyd SNL routines, and they look pale by comparison with the real things.", "Given the impossibility of his assignment, Michael Chiklis doesn't do half badly as Belushi -- he`s clearly a better actor, though not necessarily a better comic, than the original -- but otherwise Wired can claim only camp value.", "The result is a film that hedges its bets but still manages to portray the destructive power of drugs.", "What you're left with is a vague portrait of the artist as the victim of too much, too soon.", "You leave this movie unenlightened about who John Belushi really was, or why he abused himself so badly.", "Every time the film makes some sense, the sweaty and sleepless face of Belushi invades in close-up and we know it`s only a matter of time before director Peerce will make us privy to the comic`s needless death.", "The crippling flaw in the film lies in its mix of surface daring and inner funk. Inside, it keeps flinching.", "The reenacted Saturday Night Live routines that made Belushi a star seem grim.", "This crude low-budget exploiter is one of the most grotesque character assassinations ever put on film.", "Although newcomer Michael Chiklis turns in a sterling performance, Wired never allows him to explain why Belushi was such an infuriatingly drug-sodden slob, and sadly for a movie about a funny man its woefully short on humour.", "The picture certainly succeeds at reproducing Belushi's manic energy and wired-up sensibility. But it fails to give any meaningful insights into a couple of issues that must be dealt with if his biography is to have any enduring value.", "The film is commendable for neither preaching and nor excusing, for its depiction of the pressures of show business, which have an ugly-accurate, insider's feel, and for its excellent performances.", "Relentlessly offputting.", "A profoundly trivial and tasteless affair.", "Perhaps the worst thing about Wired is that it is totally unfunny.", "", "One of the all-time worst. An offense.", "It neither works as a tribute to the great man, nor as an expos\u00e9 of his outrageous life.", "It's not only that [Chiklis] seems too young, but also that he simply hasn't any idea of what it's like to scrape the bottom of life's barrel.", "Chiklis has atoned for his sins here with later roles. This Belushi biopic is monotonous and even racist (Belushi's inept guardian angel is Puerto Rican cab driver)."], "rating": ["1/4", "2/4", "2.5/4", "1.5/4", "2/5", "", "", "", "1/5", "1/5", "", "2.5/4", "", "1/5", "", "2/5", "0/5", "", "", "0/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Dennis King", "Dave Kehr", "Gene Siskel", "Carrie Rickey", "Jay Boyar", "Roger Hurlburt", "Michael Wilmington", "Ralph Novak", "John Marriott", "", "David Sterritt", "", "Variety Staff", "Rob Gonsalves", "Brian Case", "Emanuel Levy", "Mike McGranaghan", "Film4 Staff", "Vincent Canby", "Dan Lybarger"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Aisle Seat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Nitrate Online"], "date": ["July 8, 2014", "May 4, 2014", "May 4, 2014", "May 4, 2014", "May 4, 2014", "May 4, 2014", "May 4, 2014", "May 4, 2014", "May 4, 2014", "May 4, 2014", "May 4, 2014", "May 4, 2014", "March 26, 2009", "March 26, 2007", "January 26, 2006", "July 27, 2005", "April 4, 2004", "May 24, 2003", "May 20, 2003", "January 23, 2003"]}}
