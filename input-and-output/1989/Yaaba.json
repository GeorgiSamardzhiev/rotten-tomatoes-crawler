{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In a small African village, elderly Sana (Fatimata Sanga) is ostracized, but 10-year-old Bila (Noufou Ouedraogo) doesn't think she's a witch like everyone else. He even calls her Yaaba, which means grandmother. After Bila's cousin, Nopoko (Roukietou Barry), becomes deathly ill and Sana saves her, Bila comes to Sana's defense when the village medicine man accuses her of taking Nopoko's soul. It isn't until after Sana's death that the real reason behind the village's hatred comes to light.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Idrissa Ou\u00e9draogo", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The other source of Yaaba's appeal, however, is its capacity to evoke universal truths by recounting simple events and so to transcend the confines of village, state or even continent.", "Yaaba's power sneaks up on you.

It's only with a little distance from its muted beauty that the plan of the film becomes clear.", "A wonderful portrait of Third World life that will leave you with a sense of real peace.", "The locations are attractive, the performances are natural, and the details about local folkways are interesting, but the plot is a bit dull in spots.", "Ouedraogo films all this with great formality and stateliness of pace.", "It isn't a fancy or melodramatic film, and it moves rather slowly, especially if you compare it with hyperactive Hollywood pictures. But it glows with gentleness and charm", "The touching fairy-tale pic has a polished lush look, and the naturalistic performances make it look convincingly realistic.", "A direct, affecting story of superstition and love that marks Ouedraogo as a talent to watch.", "", "The director Idrissa Ouedraogo, of Burkina Faso (formerly Upper Volta) shapes this spare and resonant drama with perfect control.", "Relying on deft mise-en-scene, Ouedraogo captures the village's unique rhythms with precision and wrests great emotional power from the simple story.", "Slow and intriguing.", "A striking, compelling treatise on human values by African filmmaker Idrissa Ouedraogo.", "Yaaba has its virtues, but the talent behind it is unformed."], "rating": ["", "4/5", "5/5", "", "3/4", "", "B+", "", "4/5", "4/5", "4/4", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Jill Forbes", "Sheila Benson", "John Minson", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Dave Kehr", "David Sterritt", "Dennis Schwartz", "", "Emanuel Levy", "Janet Maslin", "", "Film4 Staff", "Chris Hicks", "Hal Hinson"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sight and Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Deseret News (Salt Lake City)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post"], "date": ["January 16, 2020", "September 12, 2013", "September 12, 2013", "September 12, 2013", "September 12, 2013", "September 12, 2013", "August 2, 2011", "February 9, 2006", "July 27, 2005", "August 30, 2004", "July 30, 2003", "May 24, 2003", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000"]}}
