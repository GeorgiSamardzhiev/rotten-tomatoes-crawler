{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After her husband dies, Alice (Ellen Burstyn) and her son, Tommy, leave their small New Mexico town for California, where Alice hopes to make it as a singer. Money problems force them to settle in Arizona instead, where Alice takes a job as waitress in a small diner. She intends to stay in Arizona just long enough to make the money needed to head back out on the road, but her plans change when she begins to fall for a rancher named David (Kris Kristofferson).", "rating": "88", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 52m", "director": "Martin Scorsese", "studio": "WarnerBros.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 1, 2008", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["[Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore] is the story of a million other women who have given up a career for husband and home.", "Ellen Burstyn, Alfred Lutter (as the 12-year-old), Diane Ladd and Lelia Goldi are all so marvelous that the effect is staggering.", "Rambling, uneven, but highly likable and enjoyable.", "Gritty '70s dramedy has some violence, strong language.", "Once in a very great while comes along a film that is so perfectly made a critic throws pad and pencil to the wind and tends to find himself frothing with glee and writing things like \"One of the year's best\" and \"Not to be missed!\"", "Martin Scorsese's ease with which he tells a dramatic story based on humor is evidence of his knowledge of actors and montage. [Full Review in Spanish]", "You can feel Scorsese try to assert himself on the material with ostentatious Steadicam shots and T. Rex music cues, but to his credit, his cinematic audacity never overshadows or overwhelms Burstyn's excellent performance.", "The whole thing is as labored, superficial, and old hat beneath the trendy veneer as anything Hollywood has been grinding out in its pre-Enlightenment decades.", "Scorsese's direction isn't showy but he keeps his camera fluid, giving scenes a sense of movement even when the characters are static.", "A typically underwhelming early effort from Martin Scorsese...", "Alice doesn't exist as a real person - she is more of a series of nonstop acting exercises for Ellen Burstyn.", "Pulsing with nervous energy, Scorsese's camera is in a state of continuous discovery", "Despite the early stylistic flourishes, Alice is a mostly naturalistic venture from Scorsese, and not that indicative of what would follow in his career. But it's a fantastic combination of these two seemingly divisive styles.", "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore is a touching and poignant movie which speaks to both sexes about the power of equality and the struggle for independence.", "Burstyn won a well-deserved Oscar for her performance, and she is matched in expertise by Ladd and Tayback, but the acting cannot conceal the storyline's shortcomings.", "Alternating between gritty realism and red-hued fantasy, this is one of those 70s films that has worn well, managing to be universal in its heart while picking out specifics that now look exactly of their time.", "As a whole it's a distended bore.", "Ellyn Burstyn's strong performance is highlight of this fine Scorsese film.", "", "Scorsese shows his range as a filmmaker and proves what makes him so good: he's a director with an eye for fancy camera work but a heart for his characters and the journeys they take."], "rating": ["", "", "", "3/5", "4/4", "", "4.5/5", "", "4/5", "1.5/4", "2/5", "", "4/5", "4/5", "3/4", "4/5", "", "4/5", "3/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Kathy Shepard", "Jacoba Atlas", "Bernard Drew", "Andrea Beach", "Donald McLean", "Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos", "Daniel Barnes", "John Simon", "Amber Wilkinson", "David Nusair", "Phil Hall", "Fernando F.
