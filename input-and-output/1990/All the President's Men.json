Revisited, it's clear how much inspiration David Fincher took for Zodiac to depict investigative reporting and workplace dynamics.", "A bravura piece of filmmaking to rank alongside his earlier 'paranoia' gem, The Parallax View.", "A timely political drama for the Trump reign.", "Pakula was clearly talented from the moment he lensed his first feature, but like so many other New Hollywood icons, nationwide recognition didn't come until he took on the story of one of the great con jobs on the American people, the Watergate scandal.", "[VIDEO ESSAY] Pakula fetishizes America's now-defunct newsroom culture that once promised to keep America's political process honest, if not accountable.", "All the President's Men is a quintessential American movie: It does a lot of things well and makes it all look simple. It works on several levels.", "While there's an undoubted fascination in all this, after a couple of hours it begins to wear thin.", "You might be rather baffled at times if you are unfamiliar with such names as Stans, Strachan and Kleindienst. I suspect that you would still be fascinated and entertained.", "The opening of the film, with Woodward (Robert Redford) and Bernstein (Dustin Hoffman) first stumbling over the story, is involving and sometimes exciting, but from then on it degenerates into confusion and repetition.", "One of the best movies ever made about American politics.", "Political commentators seem to feel that this All the President's Men will have a far-reaching political impact this year. I'd be more inclined to believe it if the film affected a provocative emotional tone. Pakula is just too cool under the collar.", "This superb film has long been acknowledged as a classic political thriller, but watching it in today's climate, at a point when a timid and ineffectual media is par for the course, also reveals its increasingly significant value as a time capsule piece.", "The effect of All the President's Men is not to make Watergate more real but to make it more remote."], "rating": ["", "", "9/10", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "4/5", "A-", "", "A", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "4/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Michael Calleri", "Dennis Harvey", "Mike Massie", "Donald McLean", "Richard Combs", "Jim Ross", "Jacoba Atlas", "Nick Rogers", "PJ Nabarro", "Dennis Schwartz", "Chris Cabin", "Cole Smithey", "Joseph Gelmis", "Arthur Knight", "Ian Cameron", "Dave Kehr", "Adrian Turner", "Gary Arnold", "Matt Brunson", "Robert Hatch"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Niagara Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">48 Hills", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bay Area Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sight and Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TAKE ONE Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Free Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Midwest Film Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Collider", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Nation"], "date": ["January 14, 2021", "October 16, 2020", "August 27, 2020", "May 13, 2020", "March 17, 2020", "February 13, 2020", "November 15, 2019", "June 24, 2019", "December 16, 2018", "May 23, 2017", "April 13, 2016", "April 3, 2016", "March 31, 2016", "July 22, 2015", "July 22, 2015", "July 22, 2015", "July 22, 2015", "July 21, 2015", "April 18, 2014", "February 12, 2013"]}}
