With Dances with Wolves, he has reduced Hollywood formula to an elegant equation of truth and beauty.", "[Dances With Wolves] packed with action, emotion, romance, laughter and an insight into a half-lost culture, is one heck of a beautiful movie.", "It's still a wonderful time at the movies by turns, a grand adventure, a great inspiration, and a missing chapter In what it means to be human.", "By never falling into the trap of allowing spectacle to supersede character, Costner's Dances with Wolves restores depth, idealism, poignancy and even wonder to a genre that had long seemed moribund.", "...well-intentioned. [Full Review in Spanish]", "That's what people have always loved about Westerns -- the feeling of size which, in the age before radio, TV and the airplane, seemed the very nature of the country.", "...Costner is capable of permeating certain sequences with lyricism.

Dances With Wolves looks back to the masterworks of the past and, with its relevance to our present, it deserves to be ranked with them.", "For the most part, ''Dances With Wolves'' is tight and interesting throughout.", "To say this movie is sporadically artful is to say that it is more interesting than most films around these days. But it is still a failure, if a glorious one.", "This is a marvel from beginning to end.", "Once in a long time, a movie speaks to the truths of U.S. history and causes the filmgoer to see past events in a new light.
