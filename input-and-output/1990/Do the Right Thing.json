{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Salvatore \"Sal\" Fragione (Danny Aiello) is the Italian owner of a pizzeria in Brooklyn. A neighborhood local, Buggin' Out (Giancarlo Esposito), becomes upset when he sees that the pizzeria's Wall of Fame exhibits only Italian actors. Buggin' Out believes a pizzeria in a black neighborhood should showcase black actors, but Sal disagrees. The wall becomes a symbol of racism and hate to Buggin' Out and to other people in the neighborhood, and tensions rise.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h", "director": "Spike Lee", "studio": "40Acres&amp;AMuleFilmworks", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 30, 2015", "box_office": "$26.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The film is honest, realistic and wonderfully written and directed by Lee.", "A compelling, commanding picture that can't truly be approached with objectiveness.", "A delectable time capsule of 1989 Brooklyn which is unfortunately as prescient as ever in its deliberation on rampant racism and police brutality, a formidable cast... makes for an unforgettable experience.", "A provocative work, emboldened not by anger but by desperation and passion.", "Do the Right Thing is so much larger than its Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn setting. That small slice of street acts as a microcosm for the entire racial system in America-one that is still at work and even more prevalent today.", "Filmmaker Lee delivers a somewhat overlong yet mostly engrossing drama...", "The vignettes are hilarious, wistful, romantic, frustrating, and tragic. Lee's pacing is masterful, and he knows just when to slow things down to give us a glimpse at the lives of these people, and when to crank up the tension another notch.", "Do the Right Thing remains an essential film over three decades later.", "Do the Right Thing remains an absolute master class in American cinema", "If you think Spike Lee's Do the Right Thing is dangerous, let me ask you: Aren't the problems he addresses, and our silent neglect of them, far more dangerous?", "You can't ignore the conversations that this movie is starting.", "Spike Lee, the innovative creator of the cult films She's Gotta Have It and School Daze, makes a quantum leap in substance and style with his latest movie.", "For all its apparent roughness, Do the Right Thing is aesthetically very sophisticated, particularly in the first half. But at the end it collapses both aesthetically and politically.", "Lee is using violence to provoke discussion in his viewers, to drive at controversial issues that don't have simple, neat, or clean answers", "The many messages of the film remain widely unheeded and Do the Right Thing remains as vital and crucial a work of cinematic art today as it was 30 years ago.", "A battle of two competing ideologies. It's blistering, thought-provoking and vibrant cinema.", "Lee is far too keyed-in to the human condition to rest on easy, lazy, \"can't we all just get along\" bromides.", "This fierce racial drama remains Spike Lee's most assured and controversial film to date, and time hasn't diminished any of its power.", "White people are at war with black people, who are in turn at war with Latinos, but Lee extends to each faction a vibrant pop-culture identity.", "The film-making technique is that of an expert sharpshooter: finding and targeting the enemies of freedom and brotherhood; in between, perforating expectation with witty asides and scripted satire set pieces."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "7/10", "5/5", "", "5/5", "3.5/4", "", "4.5/5", "5/5", "", "5/5", "", "", "4/4", "5/5", "", "", "4/5", "5/5", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Mike Massie", "Nicholas Bell", "Allen Almachar", "Karl Delossantos", "David Nusair", "Tim Brennan", "Danielle Solzman", "Sez\u00edn Koehler", "Eva Yaa Asantewaa", "Luke Parker", "Jack Garner", "Geoffrey Nowell-Smith", "James Kendrick", "Sean Mulvihill", "Rob Aldam", "David Bax", "John Ferguson", "Peter Bradshaw", "Nigel Andrews"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Smash Cut Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">About Boulder", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Solzy at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Black Girl Nerds", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">OutWeek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">VoiceBoxOffice", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gannett News Service", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sight and Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Q Network Film Desk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">FanboyNation.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Backseat Mafia", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Battleship Pretension", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Financial Times"], "date": ["September 6, 2020", "September 6, 2020", "August 11, 2020", "July 15, 2020", "June 28, 2020", "June 23, 2020", "June 11, 2020", "June 8, 2020", "May 24, 2020", "May 21, 2020", "May 12, 2020", "April 28, 2020", "January 16, 2020", "September 26, 2019", "August 27, 2019", "August 22, 2019", "August 8, 2019", "August 5, 2019", "August 2, 2019", "July 31, 2019"]}}
