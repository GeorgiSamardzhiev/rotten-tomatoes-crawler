{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Dim-witted Ernest (Jim Varney) is a janitor at a bank who gets called for jury duty. It turns out that the murder defendant, Felix Nash (also Varney), is a dead ringer for Ernest. Nash's lawyer (Jeffrey Buckner Ford) arranges a switch, and Ernest finds himself on death row while Nash goes to work at the bank, scheming up a way to rob it. Ernest then sets in motion a plan to escape jail, foil Nash's plot, snag the bank clerk job he covets and rescue his favorite teller, Charlotte (Barbara Bush).", "rating": "13", "genre": "Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 21m", "director": "John R.
