No, sir.", "The action here is more like something you'd expect to pop a quarter in a machine for.", "In a certain way, with the help of insomnia and perhaps the closure of one eye, Fire Birds actually works in a minor key. Let's just say it's the best 77-minute Apache helicopter actioner starring Nicolas Cage I've ever seen.", "What makes Birds truly riveting entertainment is not the conflict between good and bad guys, but the clash between the film's apparent intent and the loony subversiveness of its performances.", "Fire Birds resembles a morale booster project leftover from the Reagan era.", "With a gung ho script, sometimes rudimentary editing and uninvolving relationships, the whole effect is rather flat.", "", "", "Fire Birds has one director (David Green), two writers (Nick Thiel and Paul F. Edwards) and many laughs, all of them unintentional.", "", "Cage's worst movie to date.", "We get five minutes of halfway-decent action that hardly makes up for the other 90 minutes of this lukewarm diarreah-fest.", "", "Nicolas Cage and Tommy Lee Jones in a helicopter adventure.
