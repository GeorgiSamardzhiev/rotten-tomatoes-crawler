{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Seeking answers about the afterlife, Chicago medical student Nelson (Kiefer Sutherland) persuades his fellow pupils to help him end his life, and then resuscitate him in the nick of time. Atheist David (Kevin Bacon), playboy Joe (William Baldwin) and troubled Rachel (Julia Roberts) also journey into the unknown, looking for meaning in their own lives. As the experiments become more perilous, each is forced to contend with the paranormal consequences of trespassing on the other side.", "rating": "48", "genre": "Horror/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Joel Schumacher", "studio": "StonebridgeEntertainment,ColumbiaPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "Aug 10, 1990", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$58.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An intriguing premise in search of a compelling movie...", "'90s thriller about near-death experiences is very violent.", "Flatliners is moderately entertaining hocum at times, when it doesn't reach too far. Roberts is the best of the adequate bunch -- only her fans should make this a must-see.", "Schumacher puts more flash than flesh on the story, but still manages to deliver the expected chills with cool efficiency as the students' extracurricular experiments take a sinister turn.", "Julia Roberts, Kiefer Sutherland and Kevin Bacon all bring conviction to these scenes, and William Baldwin, as the most irresponsible of the students, continues to suggest an electric screen presence that rivals his brother Alec.", "Except for the performances by Roberts and Bacon, which occasionally redeem it, Flatliners is exasperating, a compelling concept unfulfilled.", "Young medical students intentionally kill and resuscitate each other, thereby gaining knowledge of the afterlife, which turns out to look a lot like... MTV.", "All I remember is that, just before I came to, there was a sudden burst of brightness. At last the movie was over, and someone had turned on the lights in the theater.", "The death trips are part travelogue, part bad dream, and they quickly start to pall with the same scene basically being repeated five times.", "The movie's problem, like many others recently, is that it isn't any deeper, dramatically or psychologically, than its own trailer. It is the trailer: the long version.", "It`s much to Schumacher's credit that Flatliners, for all of its crazy excess, does not turn into camp. Despite two or three bad laughs, the picture retains a basic conviction.", "The look is overpowering enough to delay -- though not forever -- examination of the plot, which has to pull a fast one at every turn to keep moving and which eventually makes a mockery of plausibility.", "Released shortly after the huge commercial success that was Ghost, this is a little like an overlong episode of the The Twilight Zone.", "We're supposed to think, ''Gee, will they make it back?!'' By the third or fourth close call, we're not exactly sweating.", "An intoxicating, smoky triumph, highlighting the helmer as a visual maniac who once made gloriously strange genre movies for a strange audience.", "A cautionary tale that ends along fairly traditional horror-sci-fi lines, Flatliners is a strikingly original, often brilliantly visualized film from director Joel Schumacher and writer Peter Filardi.", "", "", "We're in mystical territory here, hence the flamboyant visuals; but that's no excuse for Peter Filardi's affected script.", ""], "rating": ["2/4", "3/5", "", "3/5", "2.5/4", "2/4", "2.5/4", "1/5", "", "2/5", "3/4", "2.5/4", "", "D", "A-", "", "3/5", "2/5", "", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Nusair", "Brian Costello", "Candice Russell", "Tom Hutchinson", "John Hartl", "Carrie Rickey", "Gary Thompson", "Jay Boyar", "Ralph Novak", "Michael Wilmington", "Dave Kehr", "", "", "Owen Gleiberman", "Brian Orndorf", "Variety Staff", "Cole Smithey", "Michael Dequina", "", "Emanuel Levy"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">BrianOrndorf.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieReport.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com"], "date": ["October 17, 2017", "August 16, 2016", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "October 30, 2012", "October 30, 2012", "September 7, 2011", "August 12, 2010", "July 6, 2010", "May 10, 2008", "January 12, 2007", "January 26, 2006", "June 25, 2005"]}}
