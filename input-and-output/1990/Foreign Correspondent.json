{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Crime reporter John Jones (Joel McCrea) is turning in nothing but dull copy. His editor, unhappy with his work, hopes a change of scenery will be the thing Jones needs to get back on track. Re-assigned to Europe as a foreign correspondent, Jones is very much out of his element. When he stumbles on a spy ring, he feels ill-equipped to unravel the truth alone and he seeks help from a beautiful politician's daughter (Laraine Day) and an urbane English journalist (George Sanders).", "rating": "95", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Drama/Mystery & Suspense/Romance", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "Alfred Hitchcock", "studio": "WalterWangerProductions,Inc.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 19, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Though suffering from the effect of too many cooks in the writing kitchen, it's a title as filled with plot twists as it is wit, as well as Hitchcock's signature elaborate set pieces.", "Heavy-handed but still poignant patriotism in this Hitchcock thriller.", "The plot's twists and turns are cleverly and wittily maintained, and the supporting cast is impeccably chosen...", "The extreme coincidences are slightly more than average for Hitchcock's typically heavily-scrutinized storytelling design.", "One of two films directed by Hitchcock in 1940, Foreign Correspondent was just the beginning of his rise in American cinema.", "Alfred Hitchcock has directed another smash hit.", "A two-hour demonstration of what movies can be, and so rarely are.", "...registers most strongly as a piece of anti-isolationist propaganda.", "Creative Hitchcock thriller mixes fun, spectacular set pieces and political depth.", "While Albert Bassermann earned a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination for a somewhat hammy turn, the best performance comes from George Sanders, atypically cast as a fearless and resourceful hero rather than the cads and scoundrels he generally played.", "It's such an entertaining film that it's almost possible to forget its didactic agenda, which is certainly part of the point.", "It doesn't always proceed as smoothly as some of Hitchcock's best films, but it is never anything less than grandly entertaining.", "A fitfully crackerjack picture with astonishing mise-en-sc\u00e8ne...some memorable set pieces to take advantage of same, and flashes of Hitchockian wit...
