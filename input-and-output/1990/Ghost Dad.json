{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Elliot Hopper (Bill Cosby) is a widowed single dad who is utterly fixated on his family's financial well-being. He spends all his time working to secure a crucial business deal that would put his accounts in the black. However, this leaves his three children pining for his attention. After a fatal car accident, Hopper -- now a ghost -- must clinch the deal from the afterlife to secure his children's futures. Along the way, he discovers all the bonding he'd been missing when he was alive.", "rating": "6", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 24m", "director": "Sidney Poitier", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 24, 2016", "box_office": "$20.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Even under the direction of so distinguished and experienced a movie man as Sidney Poitier, Ghost Dad simply doesn't shape up as a really professional entertainment.", "As America's foremost TV dad, Heathcliffe Huxtable on The Cosby Show, Cosby is warm, wise and lovable.
