But if Prince is ever going to be that, he must find some decent behind-the-camera collaborators.", "Technically, the film is a compendium of stale MTV gimmicks -- dry ice, stylized sets. It's a neo-Expressionist tempest in a teapot.", "There is some plot, but it is wispy at best and frequently gets in the way of the music.", "Hardcore Prince fans might revel in His Royal Purpleness' muted philisopical musings, but everyone else will likely find this film an overblown bore.", "The movie suffers from various technical difficulties -- like choppy editing and songs that get cut off mid-groove -- and in the end everything collapses in a heap.", "If, as has been reported, Graffiti Bridge is Prince's homage to the heyday of Hollywood musicals, he should have hired a director who looks at film as more than an extended music video.", "The music is quite good and will certainly appeal to Prince fans, but it is buried under so much tedious pretention that even the performer's most devoted fans will find it difficult to sit through the film.", "As a film director, Prince remains a brilliant musician.", "Prince has had his follies, but never has he been associated with an album or film as lackluster as this one.", "A half-baked retread of tired MTV imagery and childish themes.", "Even though fans will probably enjoy the rare glimpse of reclusive Prince frolicking on the big screen, better to buy the album (as well as Pandemonium by The Time) than to waste money on this dreck.", "The meaning of this clumsy cinematic conundrum is anyone's guess.", "", "Great music video...but doesn't cut it as a movie.", "Prince is directing this time out, and even more so than in Under the Cherry Moon, the man proves he has no idea what to do behind the camera"], "rating": ["", "1/4", "", "1/4", "1/4", "", "1/4", "", "1/4", "2/4", "1.5/4", "2/5", "2/5", "D-", "", "1.5/4", "", "3/5", "2/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Alexandra Heller-Nicholas", "Christy Lemire", "Jason Bailey", "Matt Brunson", "Gene Siskel", "Jay Boyar", "Michael Upchurch", "Lou Cedrone", "Dennis King", "Mark Caro", "Steven Rea", "", "John Ferguson", "Owen Gleiberman", "Variety Staff", "Deborah Wilker", "David Hiltbrand", "Emanuel Levy", "Luke Y.
