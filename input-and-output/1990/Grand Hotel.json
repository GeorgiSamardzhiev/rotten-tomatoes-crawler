{"metadata": {"synopsis": "At a luxurious Berlin hotel between the wars, the once-wealthy Baron Felix von Gaigern (John Barrymore) supports himself as a thief and gambler. In this lavish adaptation of the successful Broadway play, the baron romances one of his marks, the aging ballerina Grusinskaya (Greta Garbo), and teams with dying accountant Otto Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore) against his former boss, crooked industrialist Preysing (Wallace Beery), and his ambitious stenographer, Flaemmchen (Joan Crawford).", "rating": "86", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Edmund Goulding", "studio": "MetroGoldwynMayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 20, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Although overlong and underwhelming, it's notable as one of the first big ensemble pieces (and surely the most famous of the time).", "It has presented a cast, difficult, if not impossible, to beat.

To us, Garbo is the supreme of magnificence.", "The camera movements and production values are elaborate and intriguing and engaging. There is a sense of activity, of bustle in every frame.", "The star-filled melodrama that is Grand Hotel became a blueprint for almost every glossy Hollywood soap opera that followed it.", "This is Golden Era Hollywood-studio style at its most opulent.", "How thoroughly does Joan Crawford own Grand Hotel?
