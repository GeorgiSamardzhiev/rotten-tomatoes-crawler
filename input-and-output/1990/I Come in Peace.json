It's just one fun section after the next (with the briefest of love scenes thrown in) before lurching towards another synth rock-scored moment of violence.", "Considering the story isn't that complicated, \"I Come in Peace\" really shouldn't be as muddled as it is.", "Dark Angel is junk food for action die-hards. Don't expect a hard-hitting story or even particularly good performances.", "As if 1988's Alien Nation weren't enough, here comes another action flick about drug dealers from another world. Lord knows there aren't enough of them on Earth to go around.", "With an upbeat script and a healthy sense of humour, this is an unashamedly ridiculous affair with moderate ambitions and matching success.", "It's B-movie stuff, but as long as an alien sucks your brain out first, you'll enjoy it.", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "rating": ["6/10", "3/5", "2/5", "3/5", "", "2/4", "", "", "", "1/4", "1.5/4", "2/5", "", "2/5", "2/5", "1/5", "2/5", "2/5", "1/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Alan Jones", "TV Guide Staff", "Sky Staff", "Kevin Thomas", "Lou Cedrone", "Roger Hurlburt", "Dave Kehr", "Charles Webb", "Mike McGranaghan", "Dustin Putman", "Steve Newton", "Mark Kermode", "William Thomas", "Caffeinated Clint", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "Emanuel Levy", "Andy Klein", "Linda Cook", "Robin Clifford"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sky Cinema", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MTV", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Aisle Seat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheFilmFile.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Georgia Straight", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Moviehole", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fantastica Daily", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles CityBeat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Quad City Times (Davenport, IA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reeling Reviews"], "date": ["September 11, 2020", "March 27, 2019", "March 26, 2019", "March 26, 2019", "March 26, 2019", "March 26, 2019", "March 26, 2019", "March 26, 2019", "July 3, 2018", "August 29, 2013", "August 15, 2013", "July 6, 2010", "February 11, 2006", "February 11, 2006", "February 7, 2006", "October 20, 2005", "October 1, 2005", "August 26, 2004", "August 4, 2004", "April 2, 2004"]}}
