{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the Los Angeles Police Department, Officer Dennis Peck (Richard Gere) is a divisive figure, loved by those who are loyal to him and looked on with suspicion by others. His disreputable behavior and dubious finances arouse the suspicion of Internal Affairs, and Sgt. Raymond Avila (Andy Garcia) and his partner (Laurie Metcalf) are assigned to investigate. When a series of witnesses are murdered, Avila realizes his life is in danger, along with that of his wife's (Nancy Travis).", "rating": "88", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 57m", "director": "Mike Figgis", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$25.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...an electrifying premise that's employed to watchable yet distressingly erratic effect by Figgis...", "Gere is hypnotic, writer Henry Bean's construction is entertainingly intricate, and director Mike Figgis knows how to turn on a subtle, authentic erotic heat.", "Figgis never lets the pace slow long enough to expose the story's thinness despite, in retrospect, a moderate amount of action.", "A lurid, lightweight throw-together of cheap psycho-thrills which tries to dress itself up as something more substantial.", "The conflict between Gere and Garcia is what carries the movie; deep beneath the macho brutality there's an almost homoerotic tint to their relationship. It makes for compelling stuff.", "Yet another goofy credit in Gere's already overloaded resume of embarrassment -- although some may consider this one of those movies that's so silly it's good.", "Internal Affairs delivers what it promises, and perhaps a little more. There's less action but more menace, and the pulse quickens as the plot drives relentlessly toward a conclusion that, in retrospect, can be seen as inevitable.", "Dark, dangerous and disturbing.", "", "", "A tense, memorable motion picture...Gere is at the top of his game", "", "", "", "", "", "Internal Affairs is, for the dim movie season that is traditionally January, an unusually bright light.", "", "A very, very good thriller.", "Internal Affairs is all stylish visuals and no substance whatsoever.
