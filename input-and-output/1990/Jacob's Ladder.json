{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After returning home from the Vietnam War, veteran Jacob Singer (Tim Robbins) struggles to maintain his sanity. Plagued by hallucinations and flashbacks, Singer rapidly falls apart as the world and people around him morph and twist into disturbing images. His girlfriend, Jezzie (Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a), and ex-wife, Sarah (Patricia Kalember), try to help, but to little avail. Even Singer's chiropractor friend, Louis (Danny Aiello), fails to reach him as he descends into madness.", "rating": "73", "genre": "Drama/Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Adrian Lyne", "studio": "CarolcoPicturesInc.", "theater_date": "Nov 2, 1990", "dvd_date": "Sep 6, 2016", "box_office": "$24.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's just as haunting as I remember.", "Jacob's Ladder wrestles with our fear of death, the power of our dreams, and the presence of angels (or are they demons?) in our lives.", "It is this constant slippage into uncertainty that makes Jacob's Ladder unique. Lyne's focus on the sensual experiences of his character helps blur that line between dream and reality...", "Though [Lyne] arguably focuses more on the thriller elements than the existential ones, he still manages a seductive, nightmare-like quality.", "'90s drama about Vietnam vet has language, violence.", "It's weird and surreal, but it ends with most of the holes plugged and all but a few of the loose ends tied into a tidy package. Some argue this is a cheat and the film should have been more open ended. That's a personal choice; I like it the way it is.", "For hours and days after you've seen it, you'll still be putting it together in your head. While all of it is gripping, it doesn't come together until the final scene, which is jolting, transcendent, unexpected yet inevitable.", "As long as the movie refuses to commit itself, it is a truly creepy, nerve-jangling experience.", "In the best puzzle movies, the pieces fit -- eventually. But if you try to piece together Jacob's Ladder, all you get for your trouble is more pieces.", "Jacob's Ladder is unique. Rarely is such an unconventional screenplay given this full-blown, $25 million studio treatment. It is a curiosity -- a mutant of a movie in an industry that specializes in clones.", "Without a strongly sympathetic figure at the center of the movie, Jacob's plight seems very remote. Watching this film should feel like being caught in a nightmare, but it feels more like watching someone else who is caught in a nightmare.", "One of Robbins' finest unheralded performances, plus a slew of supporting roles from then-unknowns Eriq LaSalle, Ving Rhames, Jason Alexander, Pruitt Taylor Vince, and an uncredited Macaulay Culkin.", "[Robbins' and Pena's] scenes together are the highlight of the film, so natural, so bright. That's why we're willing to invest a lot of time in what turns out to be a terribly overwrought plot.", "There's a word for a movie that dresses up the usual cheap tricks with real human suffering and a bogus patina of truth: offensive.", "Every story needs some kernel of internal logic, some hold on reality. But Lyne's film is like trying to scale a mountain of Jello. There's no solid ground. Everything is constantly shifting and undulating.", "Just when it's on the brink of becoming one of the most disturbing, disorienting and penetrating psychological horror movies, Jacob's Ladder -- in a self-deflating few minutes -- turns itself into a shaggy-dog story.", "A friend, after seeing Jacob's Ladder, griped, \"I wasn't afraid of dying -- until I saw this movie.\" Put that blurb in an ad and see who shows up at the multiplexes.", "Despite its frequently maddening lapses in logic and time frame, Jacob`s Ladder transcends most script ills to become a haunting and truly chilling thriller-melodrama.", "Jacob's Ladder takes a long time getting to the point, and when it does, there isn't that much to it.", "Tim Robbins gives a strong performance in this first-class horror yarn, which has a surprisingly strong political edge."], "rating": ["", "", "", "3.5/4", "3/5", "3.5/4", "4/4", "3/4", "", "2.5/4", "2/5", "", "3/4", "", "2/4", "", "3/4", "", "2/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Emma Wolfe", "Ed Travis", "Manuela Lazic", "Jeffrey M.
