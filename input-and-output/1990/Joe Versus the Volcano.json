{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Joe Banks (Tom Hanks) is dying, apparently. This is good news, since his life was not much worth living anyway. On the upside, a strange millionaire (Lloyd Bridges) offers Joe a way to die with meaning and dignity: by hurling himself into a volcano. With plenty of spending cash and an ensemble of new luggage, Joe embarks on an absurdist journey to his demise, guided by two very disparate sisters, and trying to puzzle out the meaning of existence.", "rating": "61", "genre": "Comedy/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "John Patrick Shanley", "studio": "WarnerBros.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 4, 2016", "box_office": "$39.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A silly fable about love as the end product of seizing the moment and getting out of your comfort zone, it's a scenario as superficial as Shanley's Moonstruck was substantial.", "It would be easy for Joe to embrace arch insincerity, to be a fulminating rant in fairytale clothing. Instead, it asserts that it's OK to be afraid, that emotional strength isn't always easy and that you can find what you thought forever lost.", "It speaks to the commercial and critical success of Shanley's 1987 hit 'Moonstruck' that he was handed, by a major studio, the resources to make a movie as unapologetically weird as this one.", "Playwright John Patrick Shanley made his movie directing debut with this defiantly strange, totally under-appreciated, yet completely wonderful romantic comedy.", "Like Woody Allen's filmmaking evolution played out in reverse: it starts as smart, existential black comedy and ends in broad, zany caricature.", "Cult classic with smoking, kissing, stereotypes.", "", "An overlooked gem.", "", "", "", "", "", "A more fascinating mess you'll never find.", "", "", "The unredeemable result of Hollywood's total capitulation to the Spielberg/Lucas aesthetic of the 80s.", "Excellent satire!", "Somehow I can't hate this.
