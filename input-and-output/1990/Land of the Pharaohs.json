As construction begins, Khufu's new wife, Princess Nellifer (Joan Collins), plots to secure her own piece of the tyrant's riches.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Howard Hawks", "studio": "WarnerBros.,ContinentalCompanyLtd.", "theater_date": "Jun 24, 1955", "dvd_date": "Nov 27, 2013", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["William Faulkner shared in writing this better-than-average widescreen spectacle drama, with ancient Egypt as its locale.", "Intelligent epic mixes spectacle and social commentary.", "Hawks forgoes any of those monstrous epic battle scenes, but as always most of his characters are made of shades of gray, which makes for fascinating confrontations throughout.", "When the viewing senses begin to dull from the tremendous load of spectacle, the script and Hawks' direction wisely switch to sex and intrigue.", "Much of the picture concerned itself with the building of the pyramid, not an exceptionally exciting event to watch.", "Blockbuster epics are usually not this thoughtfully put together.", "No wars; no battles; one dinky sword fight.
