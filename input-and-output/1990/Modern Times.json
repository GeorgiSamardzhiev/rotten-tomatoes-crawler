{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This comedic masterpiece finds the iconic Little Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) employed at a state-of-the-art factory where the inescapable machinery completely overwhelms him, and where various mishaps keep getting him sent to prison. In between his various jail stints, he meets and befriends an orphan girl (Paulette Goddard). Both together and apart, they try to contend with the difficulties of modern life, with the Tramp working as a waiter and eventually a performer.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Classics/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 29m", "director": "Charlie Chaplin", "studio": "CharlesChaplinProductions", "theater_date": "Feb 5, 1936", "dvd_date": "May 22, 2017", "box_office": "$163.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This movie told us to remain optimistic, that no matter what obstacles life threw at us, there would always be a better tomorrow.", "The story is simple, sweet, and incomparably beautiful.", "I reaffirm my position that it's one of the best films in the history of cinema. [Full review in Spanish]", "Chaplin finally relates his character to the actual world, and rises from funny-man to supreme satirist.", "Charlie Chaplin's hilarious 1936 spoof at the Industrial Age. Highly recommended.", "In spite of its awe-inspiring machinery and underlying significance, is really just an old-style Chaplin picture, and I don't know what better anyone could ask.", "Chaplin's humorousness, so full of suggestions, is stronger than time itself. [Full Review in Spanish]", "What elevates Modern Times - above even its cleverness - is its sense of spectacle. It's as entertaining as it is socially and politically resonant.", "The film as a whole means no more than Charlie Chaplin means. Nobody has ever been able to say what that is, but by the present showing it is something quite timeless and priceless, and more human than the best of alien words lugged in for definition.", "Chaplin's hilarious comedy still is one of the most poignant critiques of modernization and mechanization of mass production.", "Families will cherish Chaplin's silent slapstick.", "Perhaps the highlight of Chaplin's late career", "the fact that it is one of Chaplin's great masterpieces is testament to both his artistic resilience in the face of industry change and the enduring power of great silent comedy.", "Modern Times magically reaches forward through the decades, resonating loudly for these difficult modern times.", "There can be no better description for Modern Times-or indeed, Chaplin's career-than the film's initial title card: \"A story of industry, of individual enterprise-humanity crusading in the pursuit of happiness.\" [Blu-ray]", "...an enduring masterpiece that grows more relevant with each passing day.", "It is a gay, impudent and sentimental pantomimic comedy in which even the anachronisms are often as becoming as Charlie Chaplin's cane.", "Sometimes sentimental yet highly comical, Chaplin's anti-industrialisation statement is wholly idealistic but its topical reflection on industrial paranoia still resonates today.", "One of the many remarkable things about Charlie Chaplin is that his films continue to hold up, to attract and delight audiences.", "The picture is grand fun and sound entertainment, though silent.
