{"metadata": {"synopsis": "As the cruel captain of the HMS Bounty, a ship bound for Tahiti, William Bligh (Charles Laughton) wins few friends. When the crew members finally tire of his abuse, Fletcher Christian (Clark Gable) leads a mutiny, resulting in Bligh's unceremonious removal from the ship. While Christian and the remaining crew sail on to Tahiti, Bligh becomes intent on exacting revenge, and he targets Roger Byam (Franchot Tone), a sailor who had actually tried to stop the mutiny.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h 12m", "director": "Frank Lloyd", "studio": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 7, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["As a result of the redundant imagery, the momentous nature of the actual seizure - swashbuckling as it may be - doesn't hold any surprises or much suspense.", "It could boast the temporary triumphs of a strong even tempo, a decisive performance from Charles Laughton, much artful glorifying of the ship by Arthur Edeson's camera, and several Captain Bligh Editions of The Times.", "Charles Laughton, with the effective dramatic art of which he is such a master, impersonates the tyrannical Bligh, depicting him in all his vindictive brutality, yet showing the courage, skill, and endurance of the man.", "The storm shots are exciting, but the picture has little cumulative force, and misses its role as a classic record of revolt against murderous discipline.", "It is a splendid achievement, and one of which every one concerned may well feel proud.", "The visual quality in the scenes of shipboard life -- the billowing sails, the surge of the rollers, the mighty impetus of the vessel's swing -- has in it a tremendous and Infectious verve.", "A picture worth going a long way to see twice.", "Its highlight, of course, is Charles Laughton's rigid and inhuman Captain Bligh, ruthless in his treatment of the seamen. Remembered, imitated, caricatured, but never bettered, it stays indelibly in the mind long after the film is over.", "This is a ripping yarn, an old-timey sea adventure.", "The case of the crew against the insane cruelty and avariciousness of Capt. Bligh is so powerfully presented that the injustice done to the men gets under one's skin to stir up a variety of emotion.", "[A] lavish and stirring adventure on the high seas.", "it lives beyond its 65 years to be a film that is watchable and exciting today", "Despite the efforts of Producer Irving Thalberg, Director Frank Lloyd, three scenarists and $2,000,000 to give it balance, polish and direction, the picture lacks all three.", "", "There's nothing to stand in the way of Mutiny qualifying for box office dynamite rating.", "Oh yeah--Laughton and Gable--pour me another one bartender.", "The story is spellbinding, the acting lusty and the spectacle everything you could expect from a Golden Age MGM production -- though sometimes it's a bit too much on the monumental side.", "It's tainted by a fair amount of middlebrow stuffiness, but it's a fleet piece of storytelling and serves to enshrine one of the great ham performances of all time, Charles Laughton's Captain Bligh.", "Its theme of rebellion against that which binds us resonates today.
