I like the idea of this movie more than the one they made.", "Often described as a film made in the style of Alfred Hitchcock, Carol Reed's WWII-set Night Train to Munich certainly shares common ground with the Master of Suspense's 1938 gem The Lady Vanishes.", "Double-crosses and disguises, captures and escapes make up the momentum of Reed's nicely pacy adventure. [Criterion Blu-ray]", "It's fast, furious and funny but, even with that master of atmosphere Carol Reed as director, it could have done with a couple of fresh tricks to keep us guessing.", "Takes awhile to catch fire. It's always engaging, though, and builds by stages to a riveting climax at the Swiss border that would have done the Master of Suspense proud.", "Yarn is not only told without a single letdown, but it actually continues to pile up suspense to a nerve-clutching pitch.", "What is does offer is a mix of wit and wiles, a genuinely startling sequence in a concentration camp... and sprightly performance by Rex Harrison...", "testament to the skillful manner in which British filmmakers were able to produce entertaining yarns during increasingly dark times", "A cracking good story with no pretenses at anything other than pure entertainment and some mild rabble-rousing about the Nazi menace.", "Very cogently a follow-up to the scoop of The Lady Vanishes", "One of the finest spy films ever.", "The cast and script are fine, but Reed fatally lacks Hitchcock's light, witty touch and his effortless ability to create suspense out of ordinary circumstances.", "", "Superb thriller in the Hitchcock mode.", "A good mix of comedy and adventure.", "Reed's direction lacks the light touch, but he makes good use of the train, and there's an exciting climax set in a cable car."], "rating": ["3.5/5", "", "3.5/5", "3/4", "3/4", "4/5", "B+", "", "", "3.5/4", "7/10", "", "4/4", "", "3/5", "4/5", "B", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "Tyler Smith", "Christopher Lloyd", "Matt Brunson", "Peter Canavese", "David Parkinson", "Steven D.
