{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A disparate group of individuals takes refuge in an abandoned house when corpses begin to leave the graveyard in search of fresh human bodies to devour. The pragmatic Ben (Duane Jones) does his best to control the situation, but when the reanimated bodies surround the house, the other survivors begin to panic. As any semblance of order within the group begins to dissipate, the zombies start to find ways inside -- and one by one, the living humans become the prey of the deceased ones.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Classics/Cult Movies/Horror", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "George A.

Intentional or not, the film's sociopolitical content remains as potent as ever.", "All in all, Night of the Living Dead is obviously just as marvellous as it's always been.", "The immediate, quasi-documentary feel, a result of budgetary constraints, actually served the film's horror, jolting audiences because it all seemed just a little too real.", "Carve[s] open the guts of American culture, using violence and even the horror genre itself as a tool rather than an end.", "If [Romero's] original vision of the undead looks dulled by today's standards, his embedded political commentary on racism feels just as sharp.", "Director George A Romero redefined the meaning of horror for fear-sated audiences in the 1960s with this seminal classic.", "Subjects us to the kind of unrelenting nightmare we only wish we could wake up from."], "rating": ["", "", "8/10", "5/5", "8/10", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "", "3.5/4", "", "5/5", "", "4/4", "1", "", "9/10", "", "5/5", "A+"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Rachel Wagner", "A.S.
