Meanwhile, carefree bachelor Count Leon d'Algout (Melvyn Douglas) attempts to intercept the valuables on behalf of their former owner, the Grand Duchess Swana (Ina Claire). Despite their conflicting allegiances, the icy Ninotchka soon warms to Leon's charms, reluctantly going against her better judgment.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 50m", "director": "Ernst Lubitsch", "studio": "MetroGoldwynMayer,Loew&#39;sInc.", "theater_date": "Nov 9, 1939", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2009", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's Ernst Lubitsch's world--we're just living in it.", "This is the cinema's lightest and sharpest appraisal of communism.", "This is not merely a Garbo film, it is a Lubitsch film, and the result is enchanting.", "The romantic roundelay, linking fine emotions with fine lingerie, is shadowed by the brutality of Soviet tyranny.", "The prospect of seeing the usually oh-so-serious Greta Garbo nyukking it up proved irresistible to the moviegoing public of 1939.", "This column has generally no quarrel with scene-to-scene entertainment, serving a legitimate demand for relaxation, though it adds up to nothing. But the entertaining gags of this picture add up to something, and it is not pleasant.", "This one is neither crude clowning nor crude prejudice, but a literate and knowingly directed satire which lands many a shrewd crack about phony Five Year Plans, collective farms, Communist jargon and pseudo-scientific gab.", "Ninotchka is delicate flirtation and political satire made into a perfect whole, and a reminder of skills that studio writers have largely lost.", "Iridescent and teaming with vitality, Garbo glows in her penultimate film.", "Ninotchka stands as one of the finest films Lubitsch made. It was reportedly one of the director's own favorites among his films, and it's easy to see why.", "Great, but kids may need historical context.", "The masterpiece among Lubitsch's later films.", "It's comedy is rooted in classic sentimentality, but the dialog is often hammer and sickle sharp.", "It is a film that blends pratfalls and a sophisticated comedy of manners.", "Selection of Ernst Lubitsch to pilot Garbo in her first light performance in pictures proves a bull's-eye.", "The satire may be mostly a matter of easy contrasts, but the lovers inhabit a world of elegance and poise that is uniquely and movingly Lubitsch's.", "This was Garbo's first comedy and second last film. And it's a unique role for her, first because she starts off as a dour, cold comrade with no sense of humour, and second because she laughs herself into a love of capitalist vices.", "It's Garbo's next-to-last film and first American comedy.", "MGM announced to the world: Garbo Laughs! In a major departure from her screen image, Garbo brings incredibly sensual abandon to her role of a glum, scientifically trained Bolshevik envoy who succumbs to Parisian decadence of romance and champagne.", "Garbo laughs ... and the rest of us revel in a comedy delight."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "5/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "9/10", "", "", "", "", "", "B", "A", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Danielle Solzman", "A.S.
