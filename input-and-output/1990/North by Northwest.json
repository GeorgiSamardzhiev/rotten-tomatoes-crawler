But it's upon the second, third, fifteenth watch that the real joy kicks in -- at being able to identify just how magnificently this tale has been told and constructed.", "Its ingenious and witty script by Ernest Lehman was one of the handful of notable \"originals\" at a time when adaptations from \"pre-sold\" successes were all the rage in Hollywood.", "With North By Northwest truly being one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films, it was a pleasure to finally see it the way Hitchcock intended, on the big screen.", "What a beautiful film. Hitchcock confirms his care for details in this romantic story about confusion, paranoia and surprising love.
