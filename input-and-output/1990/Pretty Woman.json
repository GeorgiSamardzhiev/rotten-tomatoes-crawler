{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this modern update on Cinderella, a prostitute and a wealthy businessman fall hard for one another, forming an unlikely pair. While on a business trip in L.A., Edward (Richard Gere), who makes a living buying and breaking up companies, picks up a hooker, Vivian (Julia Roberts), on a lark. After Edward hires Vivian to stay with him for the weekend, the two get closer, only to discover there are significant hurdles to overcome as they try to bridge the gap between their very different worlds.", "rating": "63", "genre": "Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "Garry Marshall", "studio": "TouchstonePictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 21, 2015", "box_office": "$178.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An unequalled exercise in modern, mature romance, which would garner Roberts a Best Actress Academy Award nomination and a lengthy streak of box office stardom.", "Pretty Woman is packed with guilty pleasures. It's a fresh, beguiling bottom-drawer Pygmalian that entertains despite its worn premise.", "But in the end, what's most ridiculous about the film isn't the lack of realism.", "Originally meant to be a serious drama (called $3,000) about a man buying a prostitute for the night, this turned into a delightful romantic comedy in the hands of director Garry Marshall and sent the career of star Julia Roberts into the stratosphere.", "Despite its cornball attributes-maybe because of them-this is a sweetheart of an old-fashioned romantic comedy.", "The message is plain: Men, especially rich men, have all the power. So be sure to do what they tell you, and maybe they'll treat you nicely.", "Between a woman who sells her body and a man who sells shares there is no difference: There was no greater example of postmodernity than this. [Full Review in Spanish]", "[T]here's nothing light about this movie's comic touch.", "The movie's most outrageous high-concept moment - the stretch limo, private jet, opera - is pure camp.", "The Roberts smile - full-lipped, a mile wide and gleaming - is the closest the movies have yet come to capturing sunshine. Such dazzle should not be taken lightly.", "The soundtrack, including the Roy Orbison classic that gave the movie its name, is bopping, and the pacing is breezy. Gere is charismatic, and he and Roberts have a subtle chemistry, a complicity that you want to share.", "The movie displays an almost preternatural disregard for women's feelings - call it Pygmalion, with a heavy accent on the first syllable - but the comedy is so slickly delivered that audiences may be content with chuckling over its polished surface ...", "Uneven film that is not as good as the public thought at the time.", "The movie is a fairy tale, more about American consumerism than a reformed prostitute, but it's worth seeing for Julia Roberts charismatic performance.", "It's all fairly unconvincing - but its heart is roughly in the right place.", "Takes the Disney princess and puts her in the real world, creating a chick flick with a little bit of edge, a whole lot of heart and and even more chemistry between the film's two leads.", "Believing in love is swell and all, but maybe we're better off not buying the brand Pretty Woman is selling. [Blu-ray]", "The movie itself, a modern update of the Cinderella story, is as contrived as you get--isn't that not-so-secretly what we want?--but at no point is Roberts' performance", "This is old-fashioned, assembly-line moviemaking without the old panache.", "Against all odds, the presence of the incomparable Julia Roberts makes this a damn enjoyable career-defining film for Garry Marshall, and a guilty pleasure for movie lovers."], "rating": ["8/10", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "B", "3/5", "", "2/4", "3/4", "", "7"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Hal Lipper", "Laura Halferty", "Jo Berry", "Ralph Novak", "David Sterritt", "Pablo Mu\u00f1oz", "Jay Boyar", "Peter Bradshaw", "Peter Travers", "Anne Cohen", "Henry Sheehan", "Michael E.
