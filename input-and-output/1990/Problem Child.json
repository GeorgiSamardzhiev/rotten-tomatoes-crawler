{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Ben (John Ritter) is a good-hearted guy who's always wanted a son of his own, but so far he and his wife have had no success. The couple adopt Junior (Michael Oliver), a redheaded hellion who quickly makes their lives miserable. Disaster follows Junior wherever he goes, from camping trips that require emergency-room visits to birthday parties that turn into Grand Guignol affairs. When Ben's incensed family tells him to get rid of the boy, he starts to wonder if they might be right.", "rating": "0", "genre": "Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 21m", "director": "Dennis Dugan", "studio": "UniversalPictures,ImagineEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 11, 2015", "box_office": "$53.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Terrible. [Full review in Spanish]", "Sound funny? The filmmakers here think so. They've jacked this loud, lame shrieker of a movie up to the highest decibels, both aural and visual, and rammed it in our faces with almost numbing aplomb.", "It's misguided. It's not funny. And in its lame efforts to be irreverent and hip, it turns out to be just plain mean.", "There is something offensive about using an unloved and rebellious child as the butt of bad jokes in this way.", "The end is refreshingly less sentimental than it seems to be shaping up to be, but the film's ugly moments can't help but leave a bad taste.", "Some kids are born bad. Others achieve badness. And some have badness thrust upon them. The same can be said of movies.", "Smart beginning, witless ending.", "Inside Dennis Dugan's uncertainly staged, awkwardly sentimental Problem Child is another movie fighting to get out-one that's much meaner and probably more interesting.", "Pipsqueak comedy that does not have the courage of its own convictions.", "It's too bad the editors of Problem Child couldn't have saved time and money by just putting the whole film through a shredder.", "The rest of the kid's tricks are too unimaginative to be much fun -- though with jokes this lame you won't have to worry as much about your children getting any bad ideas.", "Antics of a diabolical child are neither valuable nor funny.", "The film gets so lost in angry pranks, it forgets to provide a reason why Junior shouldn't be hung from the nearest tree...The worst movie of all time? Problem Child.", "Universal took a step in the right direction by whittling Problem Child down to just 81 minutes but didn't go far enough.
