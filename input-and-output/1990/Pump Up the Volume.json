{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In Arizona, an introverted and insightful teenager, Mark Hunter (Christian Slater), finds an outlet for his viewpoints through a shortwave radio. Broadcasting as \"Hard Harry,\" Hunter uses his pirate radio show to rant against the injustices and hypocrisies taking place in the area, and in society in general. Hunter conceals his off-air identity, but a determined student (Samantha Mathis) discovers the truth, while Principal Creswood (Annie Ross) seeks to shut down Hunter once and for all.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Allan Moyle", "studio": "NewLineCinema,SCEntertainment", "theater_date": "Aug 22, 1990", "dvd_date": "Aug 15, 2000", "box_office": "$11.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["If you don't mind (or even like) the standard teen fare that is the stuff such movies are made of, there are a couple of good reasons to see this one.", "Call it Rebel With a Cause, and listen good, because it's the most frank, startling and radically opinionated movie ever made for young viewers.", "'Pump Up The Volume' Still Shines In Its Exploration of Depression and Trauma", "As a movie, 'Pump Up the Volume' is a lot like a teenager: at times unbearably self-important and pretentious (Nora's poems, good lord), yet undeniably, and admirably, earnest.", "Sharply uneven, this teen-angst feature begins exgremely well with some relevant social commentary; it also put on the map Christian Slater as a talent to watch.", "", "Slater is Moyle's generator, powering the film through some sludgy melodramatics, and while his separation of Mark and Hard Harry is practically Kabuki theater, the effort is just wonderful.", "Much more than a teen movie....an experience, and one you'll never forget.
