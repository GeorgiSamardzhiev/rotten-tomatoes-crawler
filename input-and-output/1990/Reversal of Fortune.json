{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When socialite Sunny von B\u00fclow (Glenn Close) inexplicably slips into an irreversible coma, police suspect foul play -- and the obvious suspect is her urbane husband, Claus (Jeremy Irons). After being found guilty of murder, Claus is granted a retrial and hires showboat Harvard Law professor Alan Dershowitz (Ron Silver) to represent him. Though unconvinced of Claus's innocence, Dershowitz enjoys a challenge and -- along with a group of his students -- fights to have the verdict overturned.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h", "director": "Barbet Schroeder", "studio": "SovereignPictures,Shochiku-FujiCompany[jp],ReversalFilmsInc.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 14, 2008", "box_office": "$10.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["As distant and icy as Jeremy Irons' Oscar-winning performance as suspected murderer Claus von B\u00fclow, but like Irons' inscrutable steeliness, it's also endlessly compelling.", "Enormously entertaining.", "Despite Silver's great energy, what's missing from the picture are the kind of insights necessary to explain any of the film's characters, including himself, in human terms.", "TV might make cautionary stick figures of Claus and Sunny. Reversal of Fortune treats them as if they were Noel Coward lovers gone to hell in a Lamborghini.", "Von Bulow is an enigma with a sense of humor, and that's exactly the way Irons plays him. Dershowitz is a man of exceptional cunning, and that's the way Silvers plays him. Their performances, and that of Close, will probably win Oscar nominations.", "Irons' Von Bulow is easily the most attractive and entertaining movie heavy since James Mason`s villain in North by Northwest, a figure with whom he shares a taste for elegant homes and wry understatement.", "Barbet Schroeder directed the ingeniously made film, which weaves fact, hypothesis, and conjecture into a harrowing yet continually gripping and often highly amusing narrative.", "Director Barbet Schroeder shoots The Great Gatsby-style setting with a documentary eye and gives the picture a deep sense of irony -- a quality enhanced by Irons's superb performance.", "A window on the world of the very rich, an exploration of the legal process and a story of a most corrupt marriage -- Reversal of Fortune is juicy fare.", "Though weak in several vital departments, the intricate structure of the film is so compellingly offbeat and the acting so overwhelmingly first-rate, that any reservations are eventually swept aside.", "It's a movie that outdoes the seamiest of soap operas. And it's all the more engaging because it's true.", "What a brilliant and unexpected and wickedly perverse movie this is.", "Mixing reality and fiction, without using that mixture to produce any substantial addition to our knowledge, this movie at once goes too far and not far enough.", "Screenwriter Nicholas Kazan, director Barbet Schroeder and, especially, Jeremy Irons--in a glittering performance as the divinely decadent Dane--have chosen to treat this social death spiral as a tragicomedy of manners. It's an inspired tone.", "In Barbet Schroeder's spellbinding Reversal of Fortune, Jeremy Irons plays the pure incarnation of evil.", "The trial of Claus von Bulow has been turned into more of a rumination on the American criminal justice system with a strong focus on celebrity defense counsel.", "In a more contemporary vein, Reversal of Fortune, the von Bulow story, combines inspired casting with a lethal dose of wit.", "Gripping drama.", "This brilliant and outrageously entertaining film is a meticulous reenactment of one of the great dark-side-of-the-privileged sagas of our time.", "It is a finely detailed manners study of the superwealthy, a drama of conflicting principles and values and an engrossing legal detective story."], "rating": ["3/4", "3.5/4", "", "", "4/4", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "B+", "A", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Matthew Lucas", "Matt Brunson", "Rick Chatenever", "Richard Corliss", "Lou Cedrone", "Dave Kehr", "David Sterritt", "Adrian Turner", "Candice Russell", "Warren Sonbert", "Dennis King", "Jeff Simon", "Ralph Novak", "Sheila Benson", "Hal Lipper", "Gene Siskel", "Brian D.
