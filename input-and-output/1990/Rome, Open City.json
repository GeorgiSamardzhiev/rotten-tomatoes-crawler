It's a street opera, caught on camera during wartime, a story performed by a mixed cast of amazing professionals and earnest non-professionals.", "Seventy years after its initial release, it still hits like a sledgehammer to the soul.", "Roberto Rossellini's film owes part of its emotional power to its mixture of politico-religious symbolism and quotidian humor.", "Ubaldo Arata's visceral cinematography blends the grit of a documentary with the heart and soul of a drama (Fellini collaborated on the screenplay) as the people of Rome wrestle with the constraints, compromises and collusions of life during wartime.", "An innovative fusion of documentary and melodrama.", "Aldo Fabrizi excels as the courageous priest and there are few films that have a finale as heartbreaking.", "The torture and execution scenes are harrowing and moving.", "Roberto Rossellini's benchmark 1945 work of abrasive political realism presents a crumbling Rome that's been ravaged by war.", "[Rossellini's] towering melodrama set during the Nazi occupation of the Italian capital, in the grinding endgame of the Second World War.", "Made on a tiny budget with a largely non-professional cast and filmed on the streets where similar events had just occurred, the rawness of the movie give it an immediacy that still hits home.", "A galvanic document of human and filmic regeneration", "This much of the film is standard hero and villain stuff.
