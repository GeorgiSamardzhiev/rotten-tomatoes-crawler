The teenage terrapins must somehow renew and strengthen their bond if they are to have any hope of defeating an evil industrialist's army of ancient monsters.", "rating": "34", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Animation/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 27m", "director": "Kevin Munroe", "studio": "MirageStudios,WarnerBros.,ImagiAnimationStudios,WeinsteinCompany", "theater_date": "Mar 23, 2007", "dvd_date": "Feb 1, 2013", "box_office": "$54.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["As a film, it's curious. It feels like an intermediary story.", "The Turtles still eat pizza, they still skateboard, and they're still totally badass.", "It's not quite as grown-up as it wants to be, but it's still a polished revival of a franchise that many thought long dead.", "Kids will undoubtedly want to check out these new improved Turtles . . . and a lot of parents will probably be glad to have, uh, shelled out the extra bucks to relive their own childhoods alongside them.", "Almost every good scene in TMNT is an action sequence and a lot of time and thought has been put into them. So much in fact that none seems to have been spared for the story or any of the other characters.", "The characters were no longer constrained by rubber suits or the laws of physics.", "The plot's all over the place, but director Kevin Munroe keeps it at a hare's pace. The sharp graphics impress too. It's nothing to cow about, but it does, more or less, fill its shell.", "The strongest ingredient remains the four reptiles' incorrigible charm, which easily outclasses a muddled storyline and concessions to the prepubescent male audience.", "This mediocre computer-generated action flick is packed full of monsters and sword-fights, but the story-telling is about as deft as a turtle turned on its back, struggling to get up but going nowhere fast.", "It won't convert the unfaithful but this messy, energetic action adventure is lurid fun, and may well re-ignite the popularity of the heroes in a half-shell.", "It was a great decision to animate this feature film. The great decisions end there. Unfortunately, TMNT doesn't spend nearly enough time having fun.", "Ageing fans of the originals with lowered expectations will have an okay-ish time.", "Turtle power returns in routine kiddie adventure.", "It's never, ever a good thing when the first trouble sign of a bad story comes in the opening scene.", "If none of this sounds particularly new or inventive, that's because it isn't. Darwin never said 'Cowabunga,' but he did know you evolve or you die.", "Cool CGI represents a substantial improvement over their earlier incarnations' relatively lame action sequences.", "Cowabungled.", "The characters look like plastic dolls, and the story is recycled sci-fi.", "Maybe if I were ten years old I would have enjoyed the film more.", "TMNT has enough to keep the eyes popping."], "rating": ["5/10", "", "3/5", "2/4", "5/10", "4/5", "2/4", "", "", "", "4/10", "", "2/5", "6/10", "2/5", "2/4", "C", "", "5/10", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Sean Collier", "Megan Seling", "Jamie Russell", "James Vance", "Joshua Starnes", "Kevin Carr", "Tom Meek", "Tim Grierson", "Steve Biodrowski", "Saxon Bullock", "Jeff Bayer", "James O&#39;Ehley", "Sandie Angulo Chen", "Tim Brayton", "Kevin Williamson", "Kam Williams", "Christopher Smith", "", "John J.
