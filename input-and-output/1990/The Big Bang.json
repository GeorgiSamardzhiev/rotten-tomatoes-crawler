On the one hand, it's a shame to see a talented guy slumming in this budget-bin thriller. On the other, it'd be entirely unwatchable without him.", "Doesn't always supply the smoothest ride of revelations and comeuppance, spending more time sorting out its homework than dealing with the sweet slings of sleaze and suspense that often define the genre.", "Even with Antonio Banderas leading a cast of familiar faces, the movie never rises above a style-over-substance exercise.", "I have a mental picture of the film's creators, stoned out of their minds on who knows what, cackling crazily as they outline a movie that would have more appropriately been titled \"The Big Goof.\"", "The Big Bang is a borderline unintelligible, scattershot attempt at Lynchian neo-noir that takes intellectual and aesthetic risks it has no reasonable hope of pulling off.", "The film's bleary, neon glamour and penchant for the bizarre suggests an attempted -- and wayward -- homage to David Lynch.", "You go away wondering out loud (with merit) how and where they find the money to make any movie as brain-damaged, inept, unsupervised and moronic as The Big Bang.", "Krantz has a penchant for stylization that quickly slides into a velvet-painting cheesiness, which-along with the script's pseudoprofound Philosophy 101 maxims-renders the atmosphere less noirish than ridiculously cartoonish.", "A big disappointment for fans of Antonio Banderas and film noir.", "A low-rent neo-noir propped up by descriptions of, rather than depictions of, sexual kink and an odd interest in quantum physics."], "rating": ["", "", "", "D-", "B", "1.5/4", "1/5", "C", "1.5/5", "2/5", "", "", "0/4", "1/5", "", "1/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Jason Best", "Annlee Ellingson", "D.K.
