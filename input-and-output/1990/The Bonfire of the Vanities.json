{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this adaptation of the Tom Wolfe novel, powerful Wall Street executive Sherman McCoy (Tom Hanks) is riding with his greedy girlfriend, Maria (Melanie Griffith), when she makes a wrong turn and winds up in the Bronx. There, she runs over a black boy and drives off without reporting it. When alcoholic tabloid reporter Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis) discovers the story, he knows it will be scandalous and riles up New Yorkers with his coverage of the case, which soon goes to trial.", "rating": "16", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "2h 6m", "director": "Brian De Palma", "studio": "WarnerBros.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2008", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's ultimately not difficult to see why The Bonfire of the Vanities was (and still is) regarded as an epic big-budget bomb...", "If you're interested in a faithful visual adaptation of Wolfe's novel, be assured that this isn't it.", "Brian DePalma lapses into idle, slapsticky digressions. You don't get angry at what he's attacking, or defensive; you just get weary.", "Tom Wolfe's widely read satire becomes a tedious farce, turning one of the year's most anticipated movies into one of the most disappointing.", "What a mess.", "On film, Bonfire achieves a consistency of ineptitude rare even in this era of over-inflated cinematic air bags.", "If you loved Wolfe's book, you may very well hate the movie. If you simply liked the novel, you may be simultaneously entertained and disappointed by what De Palma and Cristofer have done to it.", "Brian DePalma`s The Bonfire of the Vanities is a perfect example of how a best-selling book can be carefully altered, perceptively pruned and converted into an intriguing motion picture.", "Reduced to pure plot, the narrative is not so much a sendup of 1980s hypocrisy as an orgy of banal, juvenile mean-spiritedness. The irony of Wolfe's book becomes shrill, screaming sarcasm, unpleasant, and, worse, unfunny.", "Certainly Wolfe's canvas might lend itself to a broad approach, but broad like Dr. Strangelove, not broad like the Three Stooges.", "In this heavy-handed and uneven treatment, De Palma drains Tom Wolfe's original story of its humour, and must shoulder the blame for its failure.", "Even as they've smoothed the novel's rough edges... the filmmakers have tried to cram a maximum number of its incidents into about two hours of screen time. This gives the picture a hectic pace that adds to its feeling of weightlessness and unreality.", "The film was cast wrong and written shallowly.", "Call it Bonfire of the Calamities.", "One of the most indecently bad movies of the year.", "Has more embarrassing moments than good ones.", "Brian De Palma's take on Tom Wolfe's The Bonfire of the Vanities is a misfire of inanities.", "Ugh, what a dog.", "De Palma's characterizations may not have the subtle tongue-in-cheek wit of Tom Wolfe, but his version of the story is both more comic and angrier for it.", "If anything, it's a Hanks 'little boy lost' movie, more in the Big tradition than The Big Tradition."], "rating": ["1.5/4", "3/5", "", "1.5/4", "1.5/4", "", "2.5/4", "", "1.5/4", "1/5", "", "", "1.5/4", "1.5/4", "D", "C", "", "1/5", "3.5/4", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Nusair", "Jay Boyar", "Ralph Novak", "Gary Thompson", "Steven Rea", "Peter Travers", "John Hartl", "Roger Hurlburt", "", "Sheila Benson", "", "David Sterritt", "Gene Siskel", "Stephen Hunter", "Owen Gleiberman", "Dennis Schwartz", "Variety Staff", "Cole Smithey", "Paul Schrodt", "Wally Hammond"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rolling Stone", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slant Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out"], "date": ["May 10, 2016", "June 28, 2013", "June 28, 2013", "June 28, 2013", "June 28, 2013", "June 28, 2013", "June 28, 2013", "June 28, 2013", "June 28, 2013", "June 28, 2013", "June 28, 2013", "June 28, 2013", "June 28, 2013", "June 28, 2013", "September 7, 2011", "April 8, 2009", "March 26, 2009", "September 4, 2008", "September 10, 2006", "February 9, 2006"]}}
