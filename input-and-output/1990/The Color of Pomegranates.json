{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This avant-garde film by Russian director Sergei Parajanov depicts the life of revered the 18th-century Armenian poet and musician Sayat-Nova (Vilen Galstyan). Portraying events in the life of the artist from childhood up to his death, the movie addresses in particular his relationships with women, including his muse (Sofiko Chiaureli). The production tells Sayat-Nova's dramatic story by using both his poems and largely still camerawork, creating an impressionistic work.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Sergey Paradzhanov", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 3, 2019", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The visual tapestry of The Color of Pomegranates, set to the spoken poetry of Sayat-Nova, is what makes it unforgettable as a surrealist anomaly.", "Everything is highly ritualized and stylized, and keyed to Armenian cultural and political symbolism, but I can't help feeling the sense of liberation that infuses the film.", "Like nothing else out there - recalling the work of the early surrealists in its dogged refusal to be interpreted literally.", "One may approach it as an achievement of creativity, as an historical film, as a religious film, or even as a political film; in any case, it's rich cinematic ground for those who wish to explore unconventional art.", "As a visual exercise, it's a dazzling achievement, filmed in a manner that's almost impossible to describe.", "Experimental film is a torrent of visual creativity.", "It's a strange, visionary work, highly formal and not easy of access, but compelling in a way that's almost impossible to describe.", "I found the images occasionally striking, and sometimes bizarre, but I never connected with them in any meaningful way.", "not just some mad collection of pretty pictures, but a poetic and ethnographic evocation of Armenian religion, culture and society, told through the prism of the nation's most celebrated troubadour and his songs.", "An extremely honest attempt to convey abstraction in an essentially non-abstract medium.", "A madly beautiful, often straight-up-bonkers meditation on the life of its eponymous Armenian-Azeri balladeer and poet.", "Well worth seeing, if only as a visual treat.", "Paradjanov scares up one startling sequence after another, crafting a bizarre mosaic of Nova's world while limiting himself to the materials of the poet's time.", "It's best appreciated as an arcane work about a great tortured artist by a great tortured artist.", "", "", "As much as I can recognize the obvious effort and specific intent that went into the film, I am at a complete loss to comprehend what exactly it's trying to say to me."], "rating": ["4/5", "", "3.5/5", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "3/5", "", "9/10", "", "3/4", "", "A-", "3/5", "3/5", "1.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "CJ Sheu", "Matthew Lucas", "Benjamin Wang", "Matt Brunson", "Michael E.
