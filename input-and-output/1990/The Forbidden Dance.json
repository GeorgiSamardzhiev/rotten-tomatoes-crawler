However, although overlong, the film is consistently entertaining.", "A film that defies all sense of merit by intercutting an endless array of pelvis gyrations and Latin-inspired grooves with a tone so inconsistent and downtrodden that it left me wincing in discomfort.", "A deadly combination of inept political cartooning and fatigued, dirt-poor filmmaking anti-skills.", "Its PG-13 version of a Hollywood-vice plot is so inept it puts you in a stupor.", "", "", "What's a nubile young monarch to do? Why, head to the States and school the nature-hating, money-grubbing Yanks with some hearty forbidden dancing, of course!", "A musical without the spark of classics like Flashdance or Fame.", "Its dance sequences are barely sexier than a bowling tournament.
