{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In hopes of making some friends, Harold Lamb (Harold Lloyd) attends college at Tate University. But when the students notice his eccentric personality, he becomes the joke of the school. His fellow students convince Harold that he is popular but laugh at him behind his back, telling him that he is a player on the football team when he is actually the waterboy. Only his friend Peggy (Jobyna Ralston) knows that, to be happy, Harold must accept himself for who he really is.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Classics/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 10m", "director": "Sam Taylor, Fred Newmeyer", "studio": "TheHaroldLloydCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 23, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Few filmmakers capture the era in which they made their movies like Lloyd.", "The Freshman (1925) is actor/director Harold Lloyd's silent film satire of college life (aka College Days), one of his best-remembered and well-crafted films and also his most successful effort. It was one of the top-grossing films of the year...", "The plot is a cliche now, but at the time must have felt fresh. And even though modern viewers have seen its like perhaps dozens of times, it somehow does little to diminish The Freshman's charm.", "...another solid comedy film, featuring Lloyd as a nave character who just wants to be popular at \"Tate University,\" described in a title card as \"a large football stadium with a college attached.\"", "In a comedy of emulation, idolizing and popularity, the flimsy mannequins of maleness stand out as Lloyd gives the old college try to becoming a fresh man by being a stale model.", "A treasure that still stands as one of the greatest comedies ever made.", "there is not a college-themed cinematic yukfest that doesn't owe something to Lloyd's standard-bearer--the original revenge of the nerd", "Flawlessly executed and edited for maximum impact, the gags have timepiece precision, but Lloyd always sells his mishaps as things that just kind of happen to his character [The Freshman] works because it keeps viewers rooting for its hero.", "Lloyd has never been a very good actor; he has been a dummy for comic devices. And we are not much moved by the scene in The Freshman in which he learns at last that he has been the butt of his fellow students, instead of, as he has believed, their hero.", "My first foray into the comedic world of Harold Lloyd yielded eerily similar results to my initial exposure to W.C. Fields.", "Mr. Lloyd could be funny playing an undisturbed mummy. Simply this: The Freshman is not so funny as earlier of the comedian's adventures.", "Matriculates enough to earn a passing grade.", "Rarely less than wonderfully entertaining and involving.", "Lloyd can't compete with Chaplin and Keaton, but he perfectly embodied the can-do energy of the 1920s, and few things are quite as funny as his bespectacled, apple-pie face twisted by a panic that was always justified.", "This is a regular Harold Lloyd strip of fun, which is made all the more hilarious by introducing something like suspense in the sequences on the football field.", "Lloyd's films are prose where Keaton's were poems, but gag for gag, Lloyd was the funniest screen comic of his time."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "A+", "4/4", "7/10", "", "4/4", "4/4", "5/5", "", "6", "", "B-", "4.5/5", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Michael J.
