Led by the tough-as-nails Col. Mike Kirby (John Wayne), the team is given a top-secret mission to sneak behind enemy lines and kidnap an important Viet Cong commander. Along the way, the reporter learns to respect why America is involved in the war and helps to save the life of a war orphan whose life has been destroyed by the conflict.", "rating": "23", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h 21m", "director": "John Wayne, Ray Kellogg", "studio": "BatjacProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 8, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["No movie so archaic can have a dangerous effect on an audience.", "The Green Berets simply will not do as a film about the war in Vietnam.
