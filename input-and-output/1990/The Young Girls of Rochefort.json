And being French, it has an oblique ending that also seems to have influenced [La La Land].", "Hit musical La La Land drew inspiration from The Young Girls of Rochefort and it deserves revisitation; it is one of the greatest films of the 1960s.", "A euphoric swirl of sherbet colors, Jacques Demy's Hollywood-musical homage The Young Girls of Rochefort (1967) elevates even the most mundane actions to the spectacular ...", "Despite the consistently sprightly surface, there's a somber undercurrent that lingers even when love triumphs and the music swells.", "The true pleasures of The Young Girls of Rochefort are its smaller touches.", "The results are a bit like eating too much ice cream sundae.", "The fondant-fancy colours make the film all the more escapist, yet some pop songs can pierce you to the core.", "A very welcome rerelease of Demy's delightful 1967 musical.", "The result is uncommonly pleasing or defiantly twee: take your choice.", "An intriguing mix of French New Wave and Hollywood Musical, this still succeeds in sweeping you off your feet.", "A luminous musical about dreams, romance and destiny which lovingly reworks the classic Hollywood 'putting on a show' template into an essay on the emotional rollercoaster ride that is movie-going.", "A decidedly old-fashioned delight.", "Reminiscent of a Shakespearean comedy and seems to tap into a romantic yearning that is hardwired into our DNA.
