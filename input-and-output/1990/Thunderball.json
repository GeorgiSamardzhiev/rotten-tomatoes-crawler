It's far more chilling than in later Bonds.", "To Connery, who develops his character throughout the film with a frightening ease, demonstrating that the character fits him like a glove, adds the beauty of Luciana Paluzzi. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Not a classic like Goldfinger, but it's still fun. It'll be a long time until I watch it again, mind you. It doesn't have the rewatchable charm as some of the other Bond films", "In addition to the physical machines there is a lot of deus ex-machina involved too, but only a critic would carp about that. Just go to watch the most remarkable things.", "For all its flaws, it was classic Bond. And remains so.", "Director Terence Young never quite solves the pacing problems posed by filming underwater, but John Stears's Oscar-winning special effects more than compensate.", "Connery's last exceptional Bond as it gives 007 a competent villain, a thrilling adventure in an unusual setting, great Bond Babes and one of the series' all-time best scenes.", "Terence Young's direction is nothing if not taut, whisking the narrative along with the speed and precision of a jet plane, defying one to express boredom.", "The fourth, most commercially successful Bond to date, is known for its pre-credits sequences, underwater battles, and escalating number of violent deaths.", "Connery's Bond was never better than this.", "The ambition is evident throughout, but the execution just doesn't have enough energy to sustain it. THUNDERBALL is very sluggish.", "Turgidly paced and overly reliant on less-than-thrilling underwater sequences, it's the \"Moonraker\" of Sean Connery's run -a misstep defined by heyday technology that the producers thought would look cool in the era but feels hopelessly stale today.", "A particularly energetic, jaunty Bond adventure, the kind that is just plain fun to watch, in a perfectly relaxed and undemanding register.", "Even James Bond can miss his mark.", "Thunderball, the biggest, most lavish, and longest Bond film at that time, was the most popular of its day.", "It was still fun despite its shortcomings.", "Sean Connery's fourth Bond film, Thunderball, slips from the peak of From Russia with Love and Goldfinger, but still provides plenty of thrills of the brand only 007 can provide.
