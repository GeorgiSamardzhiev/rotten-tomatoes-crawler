{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Young history buff Kevin (Craig Warnock) can scarcely believe it when six dwarfs emerge from his closet one night. Former employees of the Supreme Being (Ralph Richardson), they've purloined a map charting all of the holes in the fabric of time and are using it to steal treasures from different historical eras. Taking Kevin with them, they variously drop in on Napoleon (Ian Holm), Robin Hood (John Cleese) and King Agamemnon (Sean Connery) before the Supreme Being catches up with them.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 50m", "director": "Terry Gilliam", "studio": "HandmadeFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 27, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Time Bandits is rife with visual, physical and thematic exaggerations that stretch the boundaries of cinematic conventions to form a crazed comedic concoction.", "Many of the exploits are lightly engaging, but never full of the tension and excitement of more polished adventure films.", "For the most part Time Bandits goes its charming, merry way weaving much hilarity as it does, until the movie careens to its twisted, unorthodox ending.", "Terry Gilliam has crafted a story so full of illusions that continuously surprise the audience. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The film lacks what Garland, Lahr, Haley, Bolger, et al, had in abundance: humanity and charm.", "It's a strange and weird and wonderful mix of boy's own adventure, Python-esque humor, and grim irony, all wrapped in tall tales, ancient myths, and historical figures.", "Gilliam opts for an acerbic and often nasty tone that risks offending the very audience at which it purported to be aimed.", "Time Bandits is one of Gilliam's more chaotic films, which is really saying something, but his six time-bandits fill the screen with fractious energy.", "As an adventure tale to enjoy with your kids, you could do much worse than Time Bandits - you just can't expect the depth of Gilliam's more adult works.", "Ex-Python Gilliam is one of the great conjurers of cinema, and this film is proof of his ample and unpredictable talent.", "This is an enterprising project in free-form cinema; it's just not very entertaining.", "Frequent bursts of twisted humour, several flashes of horror and a ton of first-class Brit cameos combine to ensure their movie never ages.", "An intoxicating dose of children's entertainment of the rarest and weirdest and most delirious kind.", "Fun fantasy has a bit of bite.", "Adults will get this movie, but kids won't.", "one of the greatest of children's fantasy movies", "A smart and imaginative fantasy with appeal for the whole family is always cause for celebration...Time Bandits rivals Roald Dahl in its surrealism and satire. [Blu-ray]", "Time Bandits remains Fantasy 101, and a must-see for people who enjoy this kind of fare.", "It's a film for kids that adults really will enjoy. A feast for the eyes with great gags and an intelligent and well realised morality.", "This film is unusually dark for a modern children's film. At times a grimly comic fairy tale, Time Bandits offers little reassurance. It's a tough world out there--even in our imaginative life. Perhaps that is why we need heroes so badly."], "rating": ["4/5", "7/10", "3/4", "", "", "", "6", "3.5/5", "6.5/10", "4/5", "", "5/5", "8/10", "4/5", "4/5", "4/4", "3.5/4", "4/5", "4.5/5", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jordan M.
