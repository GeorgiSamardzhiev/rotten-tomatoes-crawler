And now the whole town of Clyde is bracing for Carmichael's return, most of all her now-married old flame Denton Webb (Jeff Daniels) and troubled teen Dinky Bossetti (Winona Ryder). An orphan with few friends, Dinky is convinced that Carmichael is her birth mother, and that the actress will reclaim her when she returns.", "rating": "44", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Jim Abrahams", "studio": "IncorporatedTelevisionCompany", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 20, 2018", "box_office": "$3.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Focuses on the adolescent struggle to define oneself and also speaks about honesty, risk, loneliness, and self-respect.", "", "Lukewarm film that's almost worth watching.", "A forgettable, disposable, lame comedy.", "", "Quirky, moderately successful little film", "", "", "There's enough material here for several movies, but none of them turns into this one."], "rating": ["3/5", "2/5", "2/5", "1/5", "5/5", "3/5", "2/5", "3/5", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat", "Mike McGranaghan", "Alex Sandell", "Bob Bloom", "Linda Cook", "Ken Hanke", "Philip Martin", "Scott Weinberg", "Roger Ebert"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spirituality &amp; Practice", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Aisle Seat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Juicy Cerebellum", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Journal and Courier (Lafayette, IN)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Quad City Times (Davenport, IA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Sun-Times"], "date": ["August 18, 2004", "January 21, 2004", "March 4, 2003", "November 14, 2002", "September 8, 2002", "August 14, 2002", "July 31, 2002", "July 26, 2002", "January 1, 2000"]}}
