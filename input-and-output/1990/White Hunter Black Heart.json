{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Hard-living, macho movie director John Wilson (Clint Eastwood) arrives in 1950s Zimbabwe to prepare for his next film. Accompanied by screenwriter Pete Verrill (Jeff Fahey), Wilson becomes far more interested in shooting an elephant than getting ready for the shoot. Determined, Wilson moves production to a village where a native hunter helps him in his quest. Obsessed with this goal even as filming grows ever more chaotic, the director begins to question the ethics and origins of his fixation.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "1h 52m", "director": "Clint Eastwood", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,RastarPictures,MalpasoCompany", "theater_date": "Sep 14, 1990", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2009", "box_office": "$1.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's as if White Hunter, Black Heart had opened up the gap that exists in any Huston film between the playful surfaces and the depths beneath.", "Shot on location in Nigeria, the movie hinges completely on Eastwood's performance, which is strained.
