{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Max Baron (James Spader) is a Jewish advertising executive in his 20s who's still getting over the death of his wife. Nora Baker (Susan Sarandon) is a 40-something diner waitress who enjoys the wilder side of life. Mismatched or not, their attraction is instant and smoldering. With time, however, their class and age differences become an obstacle in their relationship, especially since Max can't keep Nora a secret from his Jewish friends and upper-crust associates forever.", "rating": "52", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Luis Mandoki", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$16.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["In the end, \"White Palace\" builds itself into a fairy tale romance that's easy to like and just as easy to forget.", "\"White Palace\" is more than a start for director Mandoki, who was sturdily launched with \"Gaby\"; it's a continued indication of a sure and powerful sensitivity.", "Part love story, part comedy of manners, White Palace is a thoroughly entertaining - if quite obviously far fetched - yarn.", "The film manages to avoid the more interesting problem area of what will happen to the couple once they decide to settle down and live openly together. Both principals, however, are good in their limited roles.", "White Palace stands up as an enjoyable film, despite it's many failings, because of the sensitive and sensuous direction of Luis Madoki... and fine performances.", "White Palace is more than a romance or a bedroom romp or human comedy. It is a lesson in judgments and values, and a glimpse at emotional roulette.", "The psychodrama is never as bad or as good as it could be.", "Spader and Sarandon make White Palace worth seeing, but too often they're fighting the movie's smugness.", "Outstanding performances by Susan Sarandon and James Spader, working from a relentlessly witty script, make White Palace one of the best films of its kind since The Graduate (1967).", "Not a great movie but sexy as hell.", "Glenn Savan's novel offered a stronger exploration of Reaganism and consumerism, but overall he's served well by this intelligent, involving adaptation.", "", "", "Decent but predictable steamfest.", "", "A convincing psychodrama about the redemptive power of love which can even overcome deep-seated class differences.", "", "", "The film's only surprises can be credited to these two resourceful actors, since every plot development can be seen coming from very far away.", ""], "rating": ["", "", "4/5", "2.5/4", "", "", "C+", "B-", "", "3/5", "", "3/5", "2/5", "3/5", "2/5", "3/5", "5/5", "2/5", "", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Dennis King", "Sheila Benson", "Tom Tunney", "Gene Siskel", "Kathi Maio", "Dolores Barclay", "Dennis Schwartz", "Owen Gleiberman", "Variety Staff", "Lori Hoffman", "Time Out Staff", "Emanuel Levy", "Philip Martin", "Widgett Walls", "Daniel M.
