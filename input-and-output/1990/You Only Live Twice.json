{"metadata": {"synopsis": "During the Cold War, American and Russian spacecrafts go missing, leaving each superpower believing the other is to blame. As the world teeters on the brink of nuclear war, British intelligence learns that one of the crafts has landed in the Sea of Japan. After faking his own death, secret agent James Bond (Sean Connery) is sent to investigate. In Japan, he's aided by Tiger Tanaka (Tetsuro Tamba) and the beautiful Aki (Akiko Wakabayashi), who help him uncover a sinister global conspiracy.", "rating": "73", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "Lewis Gilbert", "studio": "DanjaqProductions", "theater_date": "Jun 13, 1967", "dvd_date": "Oct 1, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The special effects aren't as visually pleasing as one might hope for, with many of the stunts clearly designed to be performed by actors in front of greenscreens.", "While far from perfect, the film stands as a series crowning achievement of spectacle, soaring Bond to literal new heights and proving that sometimes bigger is better.", "I'm going to be honest - You Only Live Twice doesn't have the best story...but in saying that, I still love this film immensely.", "The gadgets are demure, house broken, the Japanese settings are restful, the plot, such as it is, is taken seriously.", "The outlandish elements that were soon to become tired in the Bond series are actually quite novel and imaginative here.", "Still plenty of fun to be had, so long as you ignore the ... old fashioned aspects of the film, and have a sense of humour about it.", "No samurai armour; no suicide garden; not much really of Fleming's bizarre, obsessive travelogue.", "The picture is upholstered to the nines, which means there has been no cheating on the production values. Lewis Gilbert's directorial pace is at outer-space speed all the time.", "This is one of the best of the Sean Connery Bond films.", "A major draw was the establishment of Blofeld -- only tantalisingly glimpsed in previous Bonds -- played with malevolent magnificence by Donald Pleasance sporting a painful scar around his eye.", "Whatever else one can say about the Bond films, their mechanical gimmicks run rings round anything offered by most of the other spy and secret agent films.", "Another fun, exciting James Bond adventure even if it's the first of the initial five 007 outings that doesn't live up to series' expectations.", "Sluggish Bond entry has cartoonish violence, stereotyping.", "The fifth Bond film, with Agent 007 in the East, is not as good as the previous ones, but it still offers escapist entertainment.", "It's one of the series', and Connery's, best.", "the action scenes are quite enjoyable and the special effects are terrific. But the story is just so lazy and lackluster that I became uninterested during any scenes that didn't contain gunshots or explosions.", "What seems like a floundering follow-up to the canned, constrained \"Thunderball\" rights the ship with imaginative storytelling, impeccable production design and furious filmmaking flourishes that introduce the Bond hallmarks of stunts and spectacles.", "The one where the franchise became out-and-out ridiculous.", "It vainly tries to flash its escapist fun teeth with the usual implausible Bond plot.", "...an awfully minor entry within Connery's 007 run."], "rating": ["4/10", "", "3/5", "", "3/5", "4/5", "", "", "5/5", "4/5", "", "7.5/10", "3/5", "B-", "4/5", "2.5/4", "4.5/5", "8/10", "B-", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Jake Tropila", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Wilfrid Sheed", "PJ Nabarro", "David Hogan", "Penelope Houston", "W.
