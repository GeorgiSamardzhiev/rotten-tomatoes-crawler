If you love cinema, you'll love this movie. That's a promise.", "A Brighter Summer Day's extended running time pays off: Si'r's spiral towards tragedy never stretches credibility, because Yang takes the time to let it realistically occur, showing us each factor that contributes to his slow transformation.", "A film that somehow manages to exist simultaneously as a painstakingly detailed coming-of-age story, a paean to the eternal awesomeness of rock and roll, and an entrancing tone poem. If this isn't a masterpiece, then what is?", "A Brighter Summer Day is not for the faint-hearted, yet its rewards are manifold.", "A burning indictment on defining a national identity forged from those left in the dust of modern history.", "Politics and movies and fathers and sons and mothers and daughters and first love and scorching, insensate first jealousy... almost hallucinatory violence that feels like Greek tragedy and Proust and Shakespeare and electric shadows.", "Yang's graceful, naturalistic way of inserting politically fraught signifiers into his characters' hands could teach other film-makers a thing or two.", "You won't relish the thought of spending four hours with Si'r, but A Brighter Summer Day will leave you wanting even more.", "Yang's methods bring a melancholy tenderness to his recollections. He films intricately staged action in long takes of a rueful, contemplative reserve.", "Masterly done four-hour loosely based autobiographical film of the late Taiwan filmmaker Edward Yang.", "Magnificent achievement by the late Edward Yang pushes him even higher in the pantheon of great directors.", "One of those movies that, by slow accretion of detail and bold dramatic vision, disclose the structure and feeling of an entire world.", "Yang's film doesn't waste a single second of its four hours, and taken as a whole, reveals a beautiful, intricate, masterful tapestry that is as accomplished in its grand, quiet way as is The Godfather trilogy.", "The measured pace may be off-putting, but stay with it -- the accumulated wealth of detail invests the unexpected final scenes with enormous, shocking power.", "A Brighter Summer Day is itself in color, but it may as well be monochrome.", "Zhang Zhen is impressive as the youth caught up in violence and gang rivalry, his troubled adolescence a metaphor for the increasingly changing ideals and landscape of a society in flux.", "A powerful statement from Yang's generation about what it means to be Taiwanese, superior even to his recent masterpiece Yi Yi.", "A Brighter Summer Day stands as a massive achievement, perhaps the greatest in all of modern Taiwanese cinema."], "rating": ["5/5", "1", "A", "A", "", "4/5", "1", "", "4/5", "", "", "A", "", "", "", "", "4/4", "", "", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tim Brayton", "Michael Buening", "Christopher Bell", "A.A.
