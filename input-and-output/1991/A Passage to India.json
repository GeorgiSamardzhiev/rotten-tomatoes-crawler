{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Based on the renowned E.M. Forster novel, this expansive period drama centers on the changing dynamic between British colonials and native locals in India during the 1920s. When an outing to explore scenic caves ends in English tourist Adela Quested (Judy Davis) accusing Indian doctor Aziz Ahmed (Victor Banerjee) of rape, the incident results in a major court case, one that reinforces tensions between the British Empire and the growing movement towards Indian independence.", "rating": "76", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 43m", "director": "David Lean", "studio": "EMIFilmsLtd.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["By the foreseeable conclusion, it's too late to save the project from its place amongst well-intentioned, immensely mediocre moviemaking.", "It is a disappointing signpost to what lies ahead. Lean swiftly turns the narrative into a melodrama of social and sexual unease.", "Like the novel, Lean's meditative, graceful film laments and marvels at the mysteries of human behavior.", "Certainly it is important to have films which document historical oppression. But this can - and should - be accomplished in a way that does not pit one oppressed group against another.", "The spirit of the book has vanished and its strange music cannot be heard. The movie is lovely but earthbound.", "Regardless of what one thinks of David Lean and his old fashioned style, the results here - save perhaps for the casting of Alec Guinness as a Hindu professor - are exquisite.", "Lean's visually appealing film frequently connects as a social satire and a mystical melodrama of transgressors looking for footholds in psychically threatening territory.", "Lean isn't on his A-game here, but the film isn't bad.", "Lean's swan song is an intelligent adaptation of Forster's complex novel about racil prejudice and sexual repression, flaunting wonderful perfromances from the two leads, Judy Davis and particularly Dame Peggy Ashcroft.", "Epic, briliantly photographed, but slow David Lean drama.", "Lean does an excellent job of conveying the repressive nature of British society captured in the novel.", "The film, for all Lean's innate elegance, is strangely remote and unmoving. It could easily have been a Merchant-Ivory film.", "While the storytelling is rather toothless, A Passage to India is certainly well worth watching for fans of the director's epic style.", "David Lean's studied, plodding, overanalytic direction manages to kill most of the meaning in E.M. Forster's haunting novel of cultural collision in colonial India.", "An impeccably faithful, beautifully played and occasionally languorous adaptation of E.M. Forster's classic novel.", "Not for literary purists, but if you like your entertainment well tailored, then feel the quality and the width.", "Maybe a little too stately, but still a powerful and beautiful film.", "", "Forster's novel is one of the literary landmarks of this century, and now David Lean has made it into one of the greatest screen adaptations I have ever seen.", ""], "rating": ["5/10", "", "", "", "", "8", "3/4", "3.5/5", "B+", "4/5", "3.5/4", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "3/5", "4/4", "5/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Gavin Millar", "Lawrence O&#39;Toole", "Susan Shapiro", "Noel Annan", "Brian Webster", "Peter Canavese", "Christopher Null", "Emanuel Levy", "Steve Crum", "", "Ian Nathan", "Film4 Staff", "Dave Kehr", "Variety Staff", "", "Rob Thomas", "Philip Martin", "Roger Ebert", "Carol Cling"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sight and Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Maclean&#39;s Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sojourner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New York Review of Books", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Apollo Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Groucho Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmcritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Video-Reviewmaster.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Capital Times (Madison, WI)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Sun-Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Las Vegas Review-Journal"], "date": ["September 6, 2020", "February 10, 2020", "September 30, 2019", "August 21, 2019", "June 15, 2018", "April 24, 2008", "April 21, 2008", "April 17, 2008", "March 19, 2008", "March 8, 2008", "November 6, 2007", "November 6, 2007", "November 6, 2007", "November 6, 2007", "November 6, 2007", "June 24, 2006", "April 13, 2006", "December 15, 2004", "October 23, 2004", "August 22, 2003"]}}
