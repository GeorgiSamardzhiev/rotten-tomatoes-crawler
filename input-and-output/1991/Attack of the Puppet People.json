Little does she know that Franz is more than a doll maker. Really, he is really a merciless mad scientist who fights off loneliness by shrinking people and forcing them to serve as his living dolls. But, when he shrinks Sally and her new beau, they refuse to be his playthings and escape into a dangerous world that towers over them.", "rating": "28", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Cult Movies/Horror/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 19m", "director": "Bert I.
