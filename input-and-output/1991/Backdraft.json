{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Chicago firefighting brothers Stephen (Kurt Russell) and Brian (William Baldwin) have been rivals since childhood. Brian, struggling to prove himself, transfers to the arson unit. There he aids Don (Robert De Niro) in his investigation into a spate of fires involving oxygen-induced infernos called backdrafts. But when a conspiracy implicating a crooked politician and an arsonist leads Brian back to Stephen, he is forced to overcome his brotherly competitiveness in order to crack the case.", "rating": "74", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 17m", "director": "Ron Howard", "studio": "ImagineEntertainment,TrilogyEntertainmentGroup,UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$75.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Objectively, this is an overlong and overheated piece of work. But Ron Howard's visually stunning spectacle nevertheless feels human in its messiness and, for all its indulgence, memorably tactile and urgent in its conveyance of lives jeopardized.", "The story line is not always discernible, but the special effects are spectacular throughout.", "Backdraft truly shows us fire the way we've never seen it before.", "\"Backdraft\" is a spectacle worth observing; it may also generate a little more respect for firemen, everyday heroes who don`t need the movies to polish their image.", "...a top-notch thriller trapped within a poorly-paced and needlessly bloated piece of work...", "Ron Howard's film is one of smoke-eaters, crispers, and torches... and it bestows a renewed respect on a profession all too often taken for granted.", "Absolutely fantastic setpieces strung along an absolutely dimwitted script.", "Manipulative? Yes. But damn, citywide funerals, a cranked score, and some Baldwin blue steel redemption poses clears away any irksome storytelling dissatisfaction.", "Ron Howard popcorn-muncher is sappy, not smokin'.", "Backdraft may not be a very good movie, but it sure is great entertainment.", "The film exploits Chicago's terrain of ethnic neighborhoods, political turf, and glorious modern architecture, but it has trouble when it comes in close to the personal level.", "Backdraft has some of the raw filmmaking excitement that has been missing from Howard's recent work.", "Visually, pic often is exhilarating, but it's shapeless and dragged down by corny, melodramatic characters and situations.", "It's spectacular, yes, but that's not all. Not only do the firefighting scenes evoke a feeling of gritty authenticity, but the fire itself really does seem to be alive.", "Visually speaking, the film does pretty well with fire-as-spectacle, less well with everything else (Howard tends to trot out fuzzy-toned Spielbergian backlighting on any pretext).", "", "An extremely old-fashioned tale about heroic firefighters (rival siblings...) with some good special effects, this is a typical Ron Howard picture in its middlebrow sensibility and sentimentality.", "", "simultaneously overblown and threadbare", "The fire sequences are stunning, and the build-up to them, complete with blaring sirens and bellowed conversations, has an aggressive immediacy."], "rating": ["4/5", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "3/4", "5/10", "B+", "3/5", "4/5", "2/5", "B", "", "3/4", "", "4/5", "C+", "3/5", "3/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nick Rogers", "Lou Cedrone", "Kenneth Turan", "Gene Siskel", "David Nusair", "David N.
