When Henry's fears are confirmed by Wanda's infidelity with bartender Eddie (Frank Stallone), he begins an affair of his own with wealthy publisher Tully Sorenson (Alice Krige).", "rating": "77", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Barbet Schroeder", "studio": "Golan-Globus", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$116.6K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Both Rourke and Dunaway are cinematic dynamite here.", "Mickey Rourke's controlled histrionic performance and Faye Dunaway's intelligent unaffected behavior alone make the movie worth seeing.
