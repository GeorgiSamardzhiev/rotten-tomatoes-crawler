{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Tre (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is sent to live with his father, Furious Styles (Larry Fishburne), in tough South Central Los Angeles. Although his hard-nosed father instills proper values and respect in him, and his devout girlfriend Brandi (Nia Long) teaches him about faith, Tre's friends Doughboy (Ice Cube) and Ricky (Morris Chestnut) don't have the same kind of support and are drawn into the neighborhood's booming drug and gang culture, with increasingly tragic results.", "rating": "96", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 52m", "director": "John Singleton", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$55.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The story is laid out with the simplicity of a naive morality tale but is not in the least boring.", "All of these supporting characters proved indispensable to the film's lasting power.", "The dialogue is hilarious, loaded, questioning.", "It seems as box-fresh as a pair of white high-tops and as powerful and funny today as it was in 1991.", "Boyz N the Hood is a passionate drama shot with fluency and style, a study of what amounts to life during wartime, with people grimly used to gunfire and helicopters thudding overhead.", "It feels like it should be cheesy and manipulative, but the utter sincerity lifts it immeasurable.", "Singleton was only 23 when he made this urgent state-of-the-nation drama. But his skill with the camera, handling of actors, and raw dialogue suggests a seasoned pro.", "Powerful, old-school look at life surrounded by violence.", "Though it eviscerates the white establishment from the opening reel, much of the film exhibits a deeply conservative worldview, even for 1991.", "It's always risky to proclaim a new force in film based upon just one film, but Boyz N the Hood is good enough to suggest that John Singleton is going to be a major player for a long time.", "Like a jazz ensemble, Singleton and his actors slowly involve us in an almost sensual melange of moods, images and situations that take us inside the ghetto in a way mainstream films almost never do.", "While it's often as pedantic and square as an Army training film, this movie about black teens trying to grow up in a gang-plagued South Central Los Angeles area generates strong emotions.", "This is a film that people should see.", "What's fresh about Boyz N The Hood is the contemporary L.A. setting, presented with care and energy by young writer/director Singleton.", "John Singleton, a stunningly gifted newcomer, directed this complex and nuanced look at an urgently important subject.", "It's a terrific movie.", "Emotionally, this film will leave you grim-faced and shaken. It hits hard where so many films aim and miss -- at the heart.", "Alongside Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs, this was the most astonishing and hard-hitting directorial debut of the 1990s.", "Singleton sometimes displays his youthful inexperience in melodramatic emphasis and rhetorical flourishes, but he has created a deeply troubling film about responsibility.", "This is an impressive debut for Singleton."], "rating": ["", "4/4", "5/5", "4/5", "5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "", "4/4", "", "", "4/4", "3/4", "", "3/4", "", "5/5", "3.5/4", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Harriet Waugh", "Shane Slater", "Tara Brady", "Kate Muir", "Peter Bradshaw", "David Jenkins", "Neil Smith", "Andrea Beach", "Steven Wright", "Gene Siskel", "Kenneth Turan", "Ralph Novak", "Dennis King", "Gary Thompson", "David Sterritt", "Stephen Hunter", "Bill von Maurer", "David Parkinson", "Desmond Ryan", "Scott Nash"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AwardsCircuit.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Irish Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Little White Lies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slant Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Three Movie Buffs"], "date": ["July 19, 2018", "April 2, 2018", "January 10, 2017", "October 28, 2016", "October 27, 2016", "October 26, 2016", "October 24, 2016", "September 27, 2016", "September 2, 2016", "August 1, 2016", "August 1, 2016", "August 1, 2016", "August 1, 2016", "August 1, 2016", "August 1, 2016", "August 1, 2016", "August 1, 2016", "August 1, 2016", "August 1, 2016", "August 1, 2016"]}}
