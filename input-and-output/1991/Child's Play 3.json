Now Chucky's manufacturer is remaking the same line of toys with the old, still haunted materials. This resurrects Chucky, who goes after Andy (Justin Whalin), his former owner, who now attends military school. Chucky slashes his way through a string of grotesque murders as Andy tries to stop the homicidal doll and the spirit within it.", "rating": "29", "genre": "Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 29m", "director": "Jack Bender", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$13.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An older Andy faces society's will for youth to conform to the capitalist existence that is modern adulthood, and also must deal with the pressures of toxic masculinity.", "", "[Writer Don Mancini] maintains still that Child's Play 3 is the worst of the franchise.
