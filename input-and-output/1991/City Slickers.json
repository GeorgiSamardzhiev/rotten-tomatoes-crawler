{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Every year, three friends take a vacation away from their wives. This year, henpecked Phil (Daniel Stern), newly married Ed (Bruno Kirby), and Mitch (Billy Crystal) -- terrified of his midlife crisis -- decide to reignite their masculinity by taking a supervised cattle drive across the Southwest. Under the supervision of gruff cowboy Curly (Jack Palance), the men set out on a journey that turns unexpectedly dangerous. The three men bond along the way to conquering their fear of aging.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Comedy/Western", "runtime": "1h 52m", "director": "Ron Underwood", "studio": "NelsonEntertainment,CastleRockEntertainment,ColumbiaPicturesCorporation,FaceProductions,SultanEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 7, 2016", "box_office": "$119.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Billy Crystal displays his typical brand of humor, fittingly embodying a role written for him, while Palance's gravelly-voiced persona is unforgettable.", "A diverting if bumpy ride...", "An engaging, expertly played piece, which gently pokes fun at both midlife crises and the Wild West.", "The first half of this film is very funny, in a Hee Haw vs. thirtysomething way.", "One of those rare cinematic happenings: a movie that deftly combines laughs with sentiment and an occasionally serious thought.", "Many of the character exchanges are priceless (including a discussion on how to properly program a VCR), and the performances are uniformly fine.", "Crystal's then-hegemonic stardom constantly realigns the film into his, not his character's, orbit.", "City Slickers is one cattle drive you won't want to miss.", "City Slickers is really about how the West can never be more than a dream to contemporary urban Americans. With high comic style, it shows us what a lovely dream that is.", "Thankfully, Crystal is more than willing to hog the screen with his whining, impressions, and glorious chemistry with Palance, whose entire performance is based around inconsistent levels of exhaling.", "Lassos midlife-crisis laughs; teens and up.", "Director Ron Underwood (who made his feature debut on Tremors) generally keeps the herd moving at a fine pace.", "ultimately harmless", "A comedy that was and is ambitious and counterintuitive.", "The movie begins as a mildly amusing comedy about spoiled city brats taking a cattle drive before turning into a serio and predictable tale about mid-life crisis and male camaraderie.", "silly entertainment", "", "Somehow it never gets old.", "", "I found almost nothing funny about this film.
