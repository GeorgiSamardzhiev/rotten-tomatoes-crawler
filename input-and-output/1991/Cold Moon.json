{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In a sleepy Southern town, the Larkin family suffer a terrible tragedy and they're about to endure another. Traffic lights blink an eerie warning, a ghostly visage prowls in the streets, and graves erupt from the local cemetery in an implacable march of terror. And beneath the murky surface of the river, a shifting, almost human, shape slowly takes form to seek a terrible vengeance.", "rating": "70", "genre": "Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Griff Furst", "studio": "CurmudgeonFilms,HighlandFilmGroup", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 6, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["I have an affection for swampy horror movies, and Cold Moon is certainly that, with its Southern drawl characters and use of vintage locations. It has a handful of genuinely creepy, bordering on scary, moments, and I like the use of the lead actors.", "Cold Moon has its moments, but the complete lack of style, tone, and technique leaves it feeling more turgid than a movie about vengeance ghosts should ever be.", "Cold Moon is a dark little tale that takes you into the heart of paranoia and speaks to the real and latent violence of a strange transitional period in the American South.", "Frustrations aside, Cold Moon is worth watching.", "A bit of a mixed bag. Has several good jump scares and a few hard-to-ignore flaws.", "\"Cold Moon\" has its moments, offering odd, snake-infested visuals and creepy encounters, and it's sure to fit the average movie maniac's need to watch only horror features during October.", "There's little fun to be had for the audience other than in some nicely executed special effects.", "An eccentric mix of veteran actors, Southern Gothicism and neo-noir lends \"Cold Moon\" a certain charm as a ghostly revenge thriller.", "COLD MOON has the feel of a horror novel and makes for a few unexpected chills.", "Furst's (maybe) supernatural tale unfolds in a manner that, without exactly breaking any new ground, makes the most of its backwards-looking classicism with a story that is similarly entombed in the past while looking forward to our present day."], "rating": ["", "", "", "5/10", "2.5/4", "B-", "", "", "6/10", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Steven Prokopy", "Dan Scully", "Patrick King", "John Townsend", "Mike McGranaghan", "Brian Orndorf", "Kimber Myers", "Dennis Harvey", "Mark R.
