When Gallili dies, Cohen must fend for himself as the soldiers escort him to Beirut as a POW. But the trip creates an unlikely bond between Cohen and one of his captors, Ziad (Muhamad Bacri). Both men love soccer, support the Italian national team as it plays in the World Cup and may see past their differences because of this connection.", "rating": "43", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 50m", "director": "Eran Riklis", "studio": "IsraelBroadcastingAuthority,LocalProduction", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 25, 2003", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Lyrical anti-war film.", "", "This is far-fetched, and when a director takes on a fable, he or she had better be able to prove his points and back it up."], "rating": ["B", "3/5", "6"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Dennis Schwartz", "Emanuel Levy", "Jamie Gillies"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Apollo Guide"], "date": ["January 2, 2009", "July 24, 2005", "June 22, 2003"]}}
