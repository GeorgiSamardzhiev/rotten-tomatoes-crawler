It may be cotton candy, but it's well spun.", "His film is both a good mystery movie and a good movie-movie; its sheer \"movieness\" is what gives the picture its kick. As his career progressed, Branagh may very well have made better films than 'Dead Again.' But he never made another one this fun.", "Logic is dull and all that jazz. What isn't dull, though, is the way Branagh as a director attacks this material.", "Branagh's contemporary American accent is annoying, and the film's constant inter-cutting of past and present lives becomes laughable.", "It's a restless yet highly organized effort, displaying the director's desire to not just passively assemble a movie, but to rattle the senses as well.", "As the twists come thick and fast and the plot gets progressively more and more baroque, Branagh shows himself to be at least as intelligent as Brian De Palma in delivering over-the-top stylistic filigree.", "The mixture of gritty noir and supernatural shenanigans sits uneasily, but the film may simply be too bizarre to work at all.", "It straddles a fine line between genius and folly.", "Director and star Kenneth Branagh brings the same zest and bravura style to this actors' romp of a mystery-thriller as he did to Henry V.", "", "Branagh's lame stab at a romantic psychological thriller makes no sense.", "", "", "Engaging in spite of its cheesy ending", "", "Dead Again is a truly enjoyable popcorn movie, even if it is ultimately total nonsense.", "", "", "", "Really pretty lame."], "rating": ["", "", "", "1.5/4", "A-", "", "2/5", "", "", "4/5", "", "5/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3/5", "4/5", "2/5", "4/5", "4/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Ansen", "Jason Bailey", "Odie Henderson", "Gene Siskel", "Brian Orndorf", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Angie Errigo", "", "Variety Staff", "Michael Dequina", "Geoff Andrew", "Daniel M.
