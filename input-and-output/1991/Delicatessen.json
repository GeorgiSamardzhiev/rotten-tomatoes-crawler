{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Clapet (Jean-Claude Dreyfus) is a butcher who owns a run-down apartment building in post-apocalyptic France. The building is in constant need of a handyman, because Clapet routinely butchers them and sells them as food. The latest in the long ling of disposable workers is Louison (Dominique Pinon), a former circus clown desperate for work and lodging. But this time Clapet's plan hits a snag when his young daughter (Marie-Laure Dougnac) falls head over heels for the lovable Louison.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Marc Caro", "studio": "Miramax", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$4.7K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Thriving on eccentricity, the film also utilizes an artistic entwining of music and sound effects, tinged with a spectacularly compelling atmosphere of unease.", "Funny, imaginative, ghoulish and rather beautiful.", "If we take the idea of a romantic comedy set in the ruins of a dead society and dressed up with cannibal horror seriously at all, it's hard to see how it could turn out better than this.", "The movie, take it from me, is a lot more fun to sit through than to describe in a single sentence.", "Bizarre, brilliant, but wayward in its dnouement.", "With its molelike inhabitants, its sprawling war between flesh-eaters and lentil-men, its achingly sweet love story and surrealist blend of dusty antiquities and 21st-century gizmos, Delicatessen is indescribably wild.", "All of this is handled in a breezy, off-handed, nutsy manner, as the superb cast combines to help bring it off.", "Delicatessen is a fearsomely intense movie that mixes moods with formidable assurance.", "Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Marc Caro made a brilliant feature film debut with this bizarre and visually stunning comedy about cannibalism.", "A must see, Delicatessen is an absolute delight and a bizarrely madcap experience.", "What will filmmakers Jeunet and Caro serve for dessert in their next movie? Something equally daring, one hopes -- but more thoroughly cooked and a bit easier to swallow.", "Sweet, sinister and endearingly scruffy.", "Like a light-hearted Brazil it conjures up imagery of such impact, and such resonant subject matter that it will (...) affect audiences for generations to come.", "Serves up a stew that seems to be made of a little of everything from one hundred years of screen comedy, seasoned with Grand Guignol.
