[Full Review in Spanish]", "Drop Dead Fred is an erratic stab at making madness sensible, a slapstick nightmare that goes too sane, that tries too hard to be both good and rotten.", "This is easily one of the worst films I've ever seen.", "The episodic flashbacks are cast in an unfunny Freudian light -- domineering mother, helpless hubby, the tragically withdrawn child. What a laugh riot!", "That any of it, however, should suddenly, melodramatically lead to Elizabeth learning to assert herself is, to say the least, unpersuasive.", "The movie is no comic masterpiece, but it is consistently amusing in a way that sometimes reminded me of a kiddie picture and at other times of a more sophisticated comedy.", "It tries too hard to mimic Beetlejuice, especially in British comic Rik Mayall's frantic performance as the title character -- Mayall is no Michael Keaton -- but it has a whimsical comic energy.", "Drop Dead Fred is a movie for people who like the sound of fingernails on blackboards and the feel of a drill bearing into a bicuspid.", "It's rare that a movie so cleverly conceived is so poorly executed.", "It plays like a collection of bits, skits that have been thrown together with little eye to continuity.", "It's particularly irritating if you've seen the much better Harvey.", "A charmless, irritating psychological fantasy that can`t decide whether to aim at kids or adults.", "Drop Dead Fred is a therapeutic fable for people who believe that by becoming an adult, one inevitably loses the capacity to have fun. But the alternative it suggests is nothing short of horrifying.", "Just a strident celebration of booger jokes.", "[A] shrill, repulsive venture into kidsploitalion.", "Slapstick '90s comedy is filled with crass humor.", "As the naughty ghost pal of Phoebe Cates, an obnoxious British actor named Rik Mayall is like Michael Keaton's Beetlejuice without the juice.", "An appallingly unpleasant, unfunny, and deeply disturbed motion picture. It's an ear-splitting slapstick comedy for an unknown audience, unifying parents and kids in discomfort with its aggressive movement.", "Director Ate De Jong has captured the silliness of childhood with the hyperactive title character but too often drills jokes deep into the pavement, until even children will have long stopped laughing."], "rating": ["5/10", "3.5/5", "", "0/4", "1.5/4", "2/5", "4/5", "2/4", "1/4", "1.5/4", "", "2/5", "", "2/4", "1/4", "", "3/5", "F", "F", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Jorge Loser", "Michael Wilmington", "Gene Siskel", "Steven Rea", "Angie Errigo", "Jay Boyar", "John Hartl", "Johanna Steinmetz", "Gary Thompson", "Lou Cedrone", "Peter Freedman", "Candice Russell", "", "Dan Webster", "", "Brian Costello", "Owen Gleiberman", "Brian Orndorf", "Variety Staff"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spokesman-Review (Washington)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">BrianOrndorf.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety"], "date": ["September 11, 2020", "August 11, 2020", "May 5, 2014", "May 5, 2014", "May 5, 2014", "May 5, 2014", "May 5, 2014", "May 5, 2014", "May 5, 2014", "May 5, 2014", "May 5, 2014", "May 5, 2014", "May 5, 2014", "May 5, 2014", "May 5, 2014", "May 5, 2014", "June 12, 2013", "September 7, 2011", "May 24, 2011", "September 3, 2008"]}}
