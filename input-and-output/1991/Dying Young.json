{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Answering an ad for an \"attractive female\" to care for a sick young man, Hilary (Julia Roberts) becomes the caretaker of smart, well-bred Victor (Campbell Scott), who is fighting leukemia. Their business relationship slowly develops into a romance, and as Victor educates Hilary about the finer things in life, she teaches him how to love and trust another person. Victor's health continues to decline, yet the couple are determined to face his terminal prognosis together.", "rating": "23", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Joel Schumacher", "studio": "FogwoodFilms,TwentiethCenturyFox", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$32.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It also lacks cuteness, which a movie of this sort needs. A film as predictable as this one is seriously in need of scenes that stand out, scenes that give the movie a little life, no pun intended.", "Where most contemporary directors would be looking for ways to demonstrate their superiority to the material -- dropping in campy asides or meaningless technical flourishes -- Schumacher is looking for ways to make it work.", "Donate the ticket money you would have spent to medical research, and stay home.", "A decidedly dubious early 1990s love story from Joel Schumacher. The Kenny G sax solos don't help either.", "Yes, it is good to see how much of a difference actors can make with flimsy material, but wouldn't it be nice if they had something with more than the emotional weight of a Twinkie to work on?", "The onslaught-of-illness stuff is rendered not with emotion but with makeup and lighting. The actors are reduced to models in a film that tries to sell compassion by the shot.", "These people are like an adolescent's idea of adulthood. They're junior high schoolers without zits, emotionally arrested and unaware of it.", "This is an upsetting, moving film -- not one for the weak of stomach, mind or heart.", "Will someone please, please, write a part for Julia Roberts and not be happy just to look at her?", "Joel Schumacher's lamentable tear-jerker is a crass crossbreed of Love Story and Pretty Woman.", "Worst of all, Dying Young is a love story about two people who don't seem to be in love with each other.", "Dying Young belongs to the luminous Roberts. She is becoming one of the screen's finer actresses.", "Hilary O'Neil is poor but healthy, uneducated but full of spunky common sense. Victor Geddes is rich but mortally ill, overeducated and understandably fearful and withdrawn. In other words, they are made for each other.", "Joel Schumacher has converted Richard Friedenberg's cliche-ridden, uninspired script into a generally tasteful though altogether unexciting cinematic experience.", "Dying Young isn't a shameless weeper, but that's not necessarily to its credit. In a genre like this, sometimes ''tasteful'' just means confused.", "It's not a strong or particularly endearing motion picture, caught in the stylish middle, with Schumacher Schumachering all over the film with extravagant lighting and blustery interiors.", "Julia's hot; Dying Young is lukewarm.", "Just try and hold back the tears.. it's impossible", "A movie like this has only one not-so-noble reason to exist: to make us sob. And it just doesn't deliver the goods.", "Shamateurishly directed, this Roberts vehicle traversing the clichd class-clash/love story territory of Pretty Woman is a dog."], "rating": ["2/4", "3/4", "1/5", "", "2.5/5", "", "2/5", "", "2/4", "2/5", "2/4", "", "", "2/4", "C-", "C-", "", "3/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Lou Cedrone", "Dave Kehr", "Jack Yeovil", "Daniel Etherington", "Kenneth Turan", "Michael Sragow", "Jay Boyar", "Ralph Novak", "Carrie Rickey", "David Parkinson", "John Hartl", "Candice Russell", "Richard Schickel", "", "Owen Gleiberman", "Brian Orndorf", "Variety Staff", "Caffeinated Clint", "David Ansen", "Wally Hammond"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">BrianOrndorf.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Brag Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out"], "date": ["July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "September 7, 2011", "June 20, 2011", "March 26, 2009", "February 3, 2009", "October 18, 2008", "January 26, 2006"]}}
