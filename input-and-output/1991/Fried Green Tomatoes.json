{"metadata": {"synopsis": "On one of trapped housewife Evelyn Couch's (Kathy Bates) Wednesday nursing home visits, she encounters Ninny Threadgoode (Jessica Tandy), a colorful old woman who brightens Evelyn's outlook by sharing tales from her past. As Ninny recounts the exploits of her free-spirited sister-in-law Idgie (Mary Stuart Masterson), owner of a small Alabama caf\u00e9 in the 1920s, and the bond Idgie shared with her friend Ruth (Mary-Louise Parker), Evelyn gains the confidence to change her own life for the better.", "rating": "74", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 10m", "director": "Jon Avnet", "studio": "UniversalPictures,Avnet/KernerProductions,ActIIICommunications", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 15, 2012", "box_office": "$81.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["For all of its false touches, its confusions, its incohesiveness and perplexing shifts of tone, there's something wonderfully sweet and zesty about Fried Green Tomatoes.", "[A] clunky, fraudulent, yet apparently crowd-pleasing laugh-and-tear-jerker.", "When a group of actors this gifted and lively tries so good-naturedly to deliver such an obvious message, the audience is left in the position of trying to stop a tidal wave. You may hate yourself for responding, but you're smothered before you know it.", "It's a nice, pleasant celebration of friendship, but without much meat to chew on.", "It doesn't quite have the courage to face its own implications and so leaves the story that follows in a kind of blur apt to offend no one but equally incapable of moving anyone.", "Fried Green Tomatoes is gosh-darned lovable, even if it does get downright sugary at times.", "Directed and co-written by first-timer Jon Avnet, the episodic production manages to capture the fried-tomato flavor of the deep South without becoming too pushy or patronizing about it.", "Essentially a story about friendship between two pairs of women, then and now, it could be classified as an intelligent woman's picture, but this truly uplifting and gratifying movie can and should be enjoyed by all.", "Fried Green Tomatoes is a case of a film acted with such skill and conviction that glaring problems of narrative, pace and structure seem like minor slips.", "The movie never quite shakes its stiff, studied feel, just as the town of Whistle Stop never stops seeming the quaint creation of an art director.", "Fried Green Tomatoes is an engaging if sentimental tale, charmingly handled by producer-turned-director Jon Avnet and flawlessly acted by its four female stars.", "Fried Green Tomatoes is a cut above superficially similar 'women's pictures'.", "The fine performances and worthy themes are sold short. There are two films here, neither one of which is as fully developed as it could be.", "The script plods. Tandy looks as though she'd rather be elsewhere. The desire is understandable.", "The characters are engaging, but the story is hackneyed and the filmmaking is dull.", "After all, it's not every day that one encounters a sensitive tale of sisterhood that also contains an element of cannibalism. For that alone, the movie deserves respect.", "The movie left me wishing its sterling cast -- including a radiant Jessica Tandy -- had been better served.", "Stirring, sizzling serving of female empowerment.", "Tandy is at her sparkling best as the endearing old story-teller. Bates is also terrif in a funny and sympathetic turn.
