But about this time he may begin to have a nasty suspicion, subsequently confirmed, that nothing is going to happen except Miss Hayworth.", "Completely disregarding the very obvious and eye-appealing fact, that Rita Hayworth is one of the world's most beautiful women, we are going to award her our personal accolade for also being one of the most dynamic and distinguished actresses.", "If it's escape you want in a movie, you will find surcease from the worry of today's scary headlines at the Music Hall, where Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford are pitted against each other in a lusty battle of hate and love.", "The captivating Miss Hayworth turns in what is perhaps her best performance as the reckless Gilda.", "Not since the archaic days of Theda Bara and her brazen ilk has sex appeal been set forth in so rampant a fashion on the screen.", "Staggering around with this plot on their shoulders, the players, all of them competent, have a lot of trouble being convincing, particularly with the dialogue provided.", "A sumptuously sordid story about crime, major and minor, in Buenos Aires.", "[Gilda] is a confused, preposterous fable, akin, we fancy, to the phantasms conjured up in a marihuana dream.", "In Gilda, you get a smart, expensively-produced drama, deliberately and quite successfully sensational.", "It's really good pulse-tingling cinema presented in good adult taste but there are sequences from which adolescents might draw the conclusion that all that shimmers is not heavenly light.", "It establishes and sustains an atmosphere amoral, sumptuous and even passionate; it is an atmosphere to which American films often appear to aspire and which they seldom attain.", "A South American melodrama rather fuzzy as to plot but with some excellent acting and a few effective scenes.", "It's a whizzer, this one just the sort of movie, spelled capital MOVIE that can't miss, because it's got nearly everything.", "This reviewer is completely baffled as to... what happened during the picture, and what the whole idea was. But maybe it was because she was just so overwhelmed by the astounding characterization of Rita Hayworth in the title role.", "It has been a long time since so many handsomely dressed people became involved in so unpolished a romance for the delight of those who go to the movies.", "Gilda is a sultry melodrama, heavily laced with intrigue, in which Rita Hayworth dissipates as much sex-appeal as the screen will bear.", "Credit is due Charles Vidor for his expert direction, for, despite the bewildering and somewhat pointless script, he has given to the proceedings a sense of excitement and suspense that grips the spectator from start to finish.", "There is fine, serious acting by Glenn Ford, a character study by Steven Geray that is a rare treat to witness, and some imperial German arrogance from George Macready, complete with duelling scar.", "Despite close and earnest attention to this nigh-onto-two-hour film, this reviewer was utterly baffled by what happened on the screen.
