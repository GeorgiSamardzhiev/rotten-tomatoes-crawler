{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The battle of the sexes is displayed from dueling perspectives when two journalists at the same newspaper with little in common are offered their own point-counterpoint talk show. Dan Hanson (Kevin Bacon) is a conceited conservative with sex on the brain, and Lorie Bryer (Elizabeth Perkins) is an erudite liberal looking for long-term love.
