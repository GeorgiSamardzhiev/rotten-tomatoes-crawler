{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Nightclub owner Mickey O'Neill (Adrian Dunbar), a fast-talking charmer, has figured out a way to save his financial sinkhole of a business: book famous Irish tenor Josef Locke (William Hootkins) for a performance. There are several major problems, however -- Locke has been in exile for years and the man O'Neill has been in contact with is a con artist. O'Neill's reputation is destroyed, but, when the real Locke (Ned Beatty) shows up to perform, his luck may turn for the better.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Peter Chelsom", "studio": "Miramax", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$3.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Hear My Song is sprinkled with fairy dust. It's an enjoyable romantic fantasy with wonderful comic bits.", "I hated Hear My Song all the way through.", "Genuine escapism may be the true lost art of movies, which is all the more reason to celebrate the unexpected charm of the English/Irish comedy Hear My Song.", "Completely disarming and absolutely delicious.", "What makes these scenes work is the movie's sense of showmanship -- director Peter Chelsom shares Mickey's shameless, entertainment-at-any cost instincts.", "A thoroughly original romantic comedy.", "Beatty brings great comic flair and vulnerability to his role as a pub-crawling, poker-playing, handkerchief-waving singer on the lam, who is, in his own way, on the level.", "This is a treat.", "Former stage actor Peter Chelsom... makes an auspicious feature directorial debut.", "Riotously funny.", "The many charms of Hear My Song hinge on its deft balance of the puckish humor of the present situation and a genuine sense of loss and roads not taken in the past.", "Such an unalloyed joy is this Anglo-Irish comedy that it recalls the great Ealing classics of the '50s.", "Hear My Song isn't much more than an anecdote, but the actors lend this sweet, delicate wisp of a movie a surprisingly large spirit.", "Beatty does much to stem the tide of sentiment in a tough, grounded portrayal of the real Locke, a man of substance and self-awareness firmly entrenched in another life. But by the final reels, it's become too much.", "It's hard to fathom why this film was received so warmly. Despite Beatty's sterling performance, the overall tone is one of maudlin blarney.", "Ned Beatty gives a great performance in the Ireland-set charmer.", "", "The luck of the Irish is readily apparent in Hear My Song... This winning first feature by the Irish writer and director Peter Chelsom has the kind of blithe, fanciful magic that can't be achieved through skill alone.", "", ""], "rating": ["", "", "", "4/5", "3.5/4", "3/4", "", "4/5", "3/5", "", "4/4", "", "B+", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "", "3/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Hal Lipper", "Vanessa Letts", "David Ansen", "Angie Errigo", "Gary Thompson", "Gene Siskel", "People Staff", "David Parkinson", "", "Film4 Staff", "Desmond Ryan", "Kevin Thomas", "Owen Gleiberman", "Variety Staff", "Geoff Andrew", "John Wirt", "Rich Cline", "Janet Maslin", "Jeffrey M.
