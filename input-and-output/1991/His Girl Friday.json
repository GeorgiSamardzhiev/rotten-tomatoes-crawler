[Full review in Spanish]", "The whole casting of the picture, indeed, represents Mr. Hawks at his best in a department in which his skill needs no further praise.", "The film is extremely funny at top-speed.", "Cary Grant here reaches his zenith in the mental agility of crazy comedy.", "His Girl Friday is certainly very funny it is also slickly directed, and the chief parts are acted with diamond-cut-diamond precision by Rosalind Russell and Cary Grant.", "As motion picture entertainment of the bright and sparkling order, His Girl Friday is recommended without reservation.", "Unquestionably enjoyable, it's nevertheless hard not to imagine what Grant and Russell could have done with more time on screen together.
