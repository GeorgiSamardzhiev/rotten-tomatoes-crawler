{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When his young children are abducted by his old nemesis, Capt. Hook (Dustin Hoffman), middle-aged lawyer Peter Banning (Robin Williams) returns to his magical origins as Peter Pan. Peter must revisit a foggy past in which he abandoned Neverland for family life, leaving Tinkerbell (Julia Roberts) and the Lost Boys to fend for themselves. Given their bitterness toward Peter for growing up -- and their allegiance to their new leader, Rufio -- the old gang may not be happy to see him.", "rating": "29", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 24m", "director": "Steven Spielberg", "studio": "TriStarPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$116.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Hook, featuring a grown-up version of the legendary Peter Pan facing off against the captain, offers a nostalgic trip full of adventure.", "While Hook successfully transitions between tones, and the Neverland sequences are gorgeous, the movie gets a bit bloated in its second act.", "What Williams brings to Peter though isn't just his effervescence, it's his pathos and vulnerability. He's a scared, confused man just hoping to save his kids and that core of love and humanity is what makes Hook work for those of us that love it.", "Hook has everything that Hollywood currently holds dear: precocious children, regressive adults and unabashed nostalgia for old-fashioned family values.", "A woefully uneven retelling of the ''Peter Pan'' story.", "For very much like Peter, it has clearly gotten harder for this director to break free of the lure of material things and believe in simple magic.", "\"Hook\" is a huge and impressive movie. One could say it's the ultimate baby-boomer fantasy. Sadly, it's too loaded down with grown-up compromises and calculated Hollywood devices to really makes us think happy thoughts ... and fly.", "Unhappily, however, the transformation of a Type A American lawyer into a boy wonder unfolds with an uncertainty and clumsiness atypical of Spielberg.", "What it all is, really, is a glorious Spielbergian essay on the value, in gold doubloons, of rampant sentimentality.", "P.P., phone home. Or at least, get a new agent.", "''Hook'' never sets sail.", "A painful and traitorous adventure. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Spielberg's Hook is an absolute delight.", "It's a lot of fun to watch - over two hours of thrills, spills, elaborate sets and special effects, all tied together by a pleasingly varied (and lighter than usual) musical score by John Williams.", "It lights up your eyes, but it doesn't quite warm your heart.", "As top-heavy as Captain Hook's ornate, immobile ship, this lavish, elaborate production ultimately collapses under its own weight.", "Although the sentimentality gets a little sticky at times, this remains rousing entertainment.", "Bob Hoskins hops aboard as Hook's hapless mate Smee while Julia Roberts sprinkles fairydust as the mischievous Tink.", "Spielberg's Neverland carries undeniable charm and depth. The problems start when we're asked to accept its two-dimensional residents as anything other than tourists on a forced march through its various nooks and crannies.", "The story is hard to follow if you don't know Peter Pan already, and, for a child, probably even harder if you do."], "rating": ["4/5", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "3/5", "", "", "2.5/4", "2/4", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "2/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Danielle Solzman", "Germain Lussier", "Jessica Mason", "Brian D.
