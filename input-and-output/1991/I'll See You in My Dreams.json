And she sings, too!", "'ll See You in My Dreams is not a movie that will change your life but I liked spending 92 minutes with these people.", "I'll See You In My Dreams is ninety minutes as familiar as that old woolly jumper you've had for a decade, but is just as comforting.", "A moving, silky-smooth character portrait about an older woman's private lament of a world passing her by and the beauty of life in twilight. It's your one-way ticket to summertime serenity.", "It's quite refreshing to see a film about life and all it's true ups and downs as we age. This lovely romantic dramedy is perfect for the over 40 age group.", "Like other later-in-life romantic movies, I'll See You in My Dreams tells us that it's never too late to fall in love.
