{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In Frank Capra's acclaimed romantic comedy, spoiled heiress Ellie Andrews (Claudette Colbert) impetuously marries the scheming King Westley, leading her tycoon father (Walter Connolly) to spirit her away on his yacht. After jumping ship, Ellie falls in with cynical newspaper reporter Peter Warne (Clark Gable), who offers to help her reunite with her new husband in exchange for an exclusive story. But during their travels, the reporter finds himself falling for the feisty young heiress.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Frank Capra", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It Happened One Night has only gotten better over the years; its vivid and amusing depiction of a bygone social culture adding to its impressive charms.", "The screenplay is sensational, alternating between dramatic, comedic, and romantic, handling each with remarkable care.", "A very merry picture and one which puts Gable back on the map as an ace matinee idol.", "It Is pleasant to travel across the United States with these two bickering vagabonds.", "The story is improbable, but it is consistently entertaining and it has several sequences which are guaranteed to reduce any normal audience to a state of agreeable hysteria.", "I have seen Claudette Colbert better cast. She has too much character to suggest a helpless heiress who has never been allowed out alone before. However, most of the acting is excellent, and Frank Capra's direction is full of effective touches.", "It's all about the snappy dialogue and simmering tension between these hugely charismatic stars.", "A charming, human, believable story, with charming, human, believable characters.", "It Happened One Night is as lively, witty and romantic as ever. Buoyed up by dual performances from two of the era's greats, Capra's film maintains its status as a classic.", "It's sweet, cheerful, funny, and very, very good.", "One of the best comedies of its era, with a rich inventiveness of character and situation.", "Frank Capra's It Happened One Night was a film that defied expectations to such an outrageous extent that the cinema has never fully recovered from its impact or influence.", "It's probably more historically important than it is a masterpiece (the last 20 minutes take the missed conections and misunderstandings an inch too far), but it's still very easy to fall in love with.", "The direction is excellent. Frank Capra never lets his picture lag for a moment. It is never very exciting, but it moves along snappily and it is full of amusing situations.", "Perhaps not the greatest of the screwball comedies, but Frank Capra's It Happened One Night is one of the racier.", "Viewed even today with all of its plot elements recycled ad nauseam by Hollywood (for rom-coms, road trip comedies, odd couple/buddy films, etc.), the film still holds up because we believe Gable and Colbert and can identify with them both right away.", "It's nearly impossible to find anyone who doesn't love it. Or doesn't feel, in some way, that it speaks to them.", "It Happened One Night was in many ways a predecessor to the modern romantic comedy, and its dynamics will still feel familiar to the current-day viewer.", "It Happened One Night is one of the easiest movies to love and one of the hardest to think of as a work of art.", "It's funny, beautifully directed and acted and it's always been one of my favourites."], "rating": ["5/5", "1", "", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "5/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "3/5", "3.5/4", "5/5", "8/10", "A+", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "Mike Massie", "E. de S.
