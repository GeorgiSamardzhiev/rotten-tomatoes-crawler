{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A married black lawyer named Flipper (Wesley Snipes) begins an affair with Angie (Annabella Sciorra), his white secretary. When the news is leaked through an acquaintance, Flipper's wife (Lonette McKee) kicks him out of the house. Flipper decides to begin courting his mistress, only to be greeted by disapproval from friends, family and even strangers. The relationship continues to be strained in a society not ready to accept it, and people are hurt during its inception.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 12m", "director": "Spike Lee", "studio": "UniversalPictures,40Acres&amp;AMuleFilmworks", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 7, 2006", "box_office": "$31.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The ingrained self-hatred of its characters reflect outward toward those who remind them of themselves.", "However diffuse the movie's agenda, it is never less than thoroughly involving.", "In that sense, Lee is a victim of his own high standard.", "Jungle Fever is so many graceful things, so many angry things, so many truly moving things that its occasional faults are the faults of excess passion, not failure of imagination.", "Strong and powerful, Jungle Fever dares us to be disinterested, dares us to turn away.", "It's all too much for Lee to handle. Jungle Fever is overlong, yet he hasn't found the screen time to give each of these people his or her reasons, and even the Snipes and Sciorra characters slip away from him.", "Jungle Fever is confidently acted, brilliantly written and thoroughly provocative. Lee has succeeded again.", "It certainly is something to see.", "You'll remember Sciorra and Snipes but wish you had learned more about them -- and the society that complicates their lives so cruelly.", "Isn't it refreshing to talk about a thoughtful movie in a summer full of fluff?", "Jungle Fever may be a failure, but it is the kind of failure that engenders hope: It finds Lee refining the skills he already possesses and striking out in encouraging new directions.", "Lee's direction is wonderfully fluid and, as in most of his movies, he is superbly served by the striking cinematography of Ernest Dickerson and strong lead performances. However, there is a glibness to his script.", "Weaknesses aside, Jungle Fever remains the most thoughtful, provocative, and deeply felt statement on race problems and gender relations to arrive on screen in a very long time -- and the funniest and most entertaining to boot.", "A thematic follow up to Do the Right Thing, this is a powerful melodrama about the fatal and fateful effects of interracial romance.", "Snipes, it's clear, is a major actor.", "Lee brings a shotgun to a knife fight, but his visual energy is undeniably effective, spraying the screen with venom and appalling realities, with most of the feature locked in confessional mode.", "Always provocative.", "Includes a number of memorable set pieces, most notably a visit to a crack den which, accompanied by the epic sound of Stevie Wonder's \"Living In The City,\" is simply unforgettable.", "It's uneven, but its best moments -- such as Samuel L Jackson's performance -- are amongst Lee's finest achievements on film.", "Though Wesley Snipes and Annabella Sciorra perform well, the script provides no deeper motivations or meanings for their relationship. Situations around them prove more interesting and dynamic."], "rating": ["", "3/4", "2.5/4", "3.5/4", "", "2.5/4", "", "3/5", "", "3.5/4", "2/4", "3/5", "", "B+", "B-", "A-", "B", "4/5", "", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Odie Henderson", "Carrie Rickey", "Gary Thompson", "Stephen Hunter", "Kenneth Turan", "John Hartl", "Candice Russell", "Jay Boyar", "Ralph Novak", "Gene Siskel", "Dave Kehr", "John Ferguson", "David Sterritt", "Emanuel Levy", "Owen Gleiberman", "Brian Orndorf", "Dennis Schwartz", "Barry McIlheney", "", ""], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slant Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">BrianOrndorf.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide"], "date": ["June 23, 2016", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "January 28, 2013", "September 7, 2011", "June 9, 2011", "April 27, 2011", "September 22, 2008", "September 22, 2008", "September 22, 2008"]}}
