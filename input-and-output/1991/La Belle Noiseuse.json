{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Famous painter Edouard (Michel Piccoli) stopped working long ago and now lives in the countryside with his wife, Liz (Jane Birkin). When his friend Nicolas (David Bursztein) visits, Edouard is taken with his striking girlfriend, Marianne (Emmanuelle Beart), who inspires him to try to complete a nude portrait he gave up on years ago. At Nicolas' suggestion, Marianne agrees to serve as Edouard's model, and the painter and his new muse begin working on the difficult project.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "2h 5m", "director": "Jacques Rivette", "studio": "", "theater_date": "Sep 17, 1993", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$1.9K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["La Belle Noiseuse will immerse you in a one-of-a-kind portrait of the artistic process.", "This is a movie about the making of a masterpiece which is itself a masterpiece, one of the truly great movies about artistic creation.", "In its own way this sensual, granular experience is just as pure and obsessive as Rivette's less hospitable masterpieces, and almost as mysterious.", "Jacques Rivette's magisterial portrait of the creative process lays bare an artist's conflicted responsibilities toward life and art.", "Long takes, slow zooms, and deep focus give 'La Belle Noiseuse' a sense of disciplined stillness, all the better to record the meticulous efforts of its two chief subjects as they make art out of life.", "", "It's a lighter film, but by no means slighter, more like the difference between a Henry James short story and an extended performance piece.", "Like all great works of art, the film has a purity of line and structure as it plays out its theme.", "Rivette's superb sense of rhythm and mise en scene never falters, and the plot has plenty of twists.", "Jacques Rivette's much praised Cannes Grand Prize winner vacillates between genuine insight and didactic mystique-of-the-artist bull****.", "As impeccably shot as its subject deserves, the film is more accessible than most of Rivette's work, with characteristically playful passing nods to the relationship between life and performance.", "", "", "I won't explain what happens with the masterpiece; even at four hours, the film cooks up a certain amount of suspense and surprise.", "In this molasses-slow four-hour drama, Jacques Rivette proves that he's got an understanding of fine art, but a minimal one of the art of movies.", "Hypnotically beautiful.", "One of the best movies about painting.", "", "The characters are unsympathetic, the circumstances are hard to relate to, the dialogue is laboured and the running time brutal.
