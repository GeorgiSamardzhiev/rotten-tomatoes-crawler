But it is hard to work up any sustained sympathy for the uptight characters.", "Gothic psychologizing melodrama, so preposterously full-blown and straight-faced that it's a juicy entertainment.", "[Tierney is] exceptional in the part, and far better than the legions of actresses who've subsequently set down the rolling pin and bouquet in favour of the ice pick.", "The beautiful Tierney betrays her lovely countenance by playing one of the most evil creatures ever to slink across the screen.", "[T]his poison-apple parable contains at its center a slinky femme fatale with a steadfast belief in all-embracing damnation.", "One of the most intensely cruel and lurid film noir ever made, John Stahl's excessive melodrama features Gene Tierney in an Oscar nominated performances as a cold-blooded murderess.", "Mental illness never looked so seductive or bit with such a ferocious over-bite as from Gene Tierney's demented character.", "Stahl's use of space and the performances in Leave Her to Heaven...suggest he was at least the equal of the much-exalted Sirk as an artist of melodrama.", "Tierney's Ellen Berent [is] one of cinema's most chilling psychopaths.", "As for the brother's death, with Ellen looking on coolly in white robe and shades, it remains one of the most perturbing in the history of Hollywood.", "Has emotional power in the jealousy theme but it hasn't been as forcefully interpreted by the leads as it could have been in more histrionically capable hands.", "Everything is beautiful in Leave Her to Heaven. In fact, too beautiful.", "A fevered yet clinical study of jealousy, Leave Her to Heaven is probably John M. Stahl's best-known film.", "Stahl is totally in control, his precise pacing and compositions lending a persuasive dimension of amour fou, while Leon Shamroy's camerawork makes each image a purring pleasure on the eye."], "rating": ["", "", "9/10", "4.5/5", "3/4", "4.5/5", "", "", "", "3/4", "5/6", "A", "A+", "", "", "", "", "4.5/5", "3.5/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Sara Hamilton", "Marjory Adams", "Mike Massie", "Nicholas Bell", "Matt Brunson", "Tim Brayton", "James Agee", "Pauline Kael", "Richard Luck", "", "Keith Uhlich", "Emanuel Levy", "Cole Smithey", "Lou Lumenick", "Melissa Anderson", "Anthony Lane", "Variety Staff", "Paul Brenner", "Dan Callahan", "Tom Milne"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Photoplay", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Globe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Frenzy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternate Ending", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Village Voice", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmcritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slant Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out"], "date": ["December 31, 2020", "December 31, 2020", "August 13, 2020", "July 31, 2020", "March 29, 2020", "November 21, 2019", "February 28, 2018", "April 7, 2016", "November 6, 2014", "November 6, 2014", "November 17, 2011", "August 16, 2010", "April 12, 2009", "March 6, 2009", "March 3, 2009", "March 2, 2009", "May 30, 2008", "October 19, 2007", "September 18, 2007", "June 24, 2006"]}}
