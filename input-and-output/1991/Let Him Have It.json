{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this fact-based film, British working class teens Derek Bentley (Christopher Eccleston) and Chris Craig (Paul Reynolds) take to behaving like the film noir antiheroes they idolize, and Chris begins carrying a gun to look the part. Unfortunately, the boys have a run-in with a police officer that takes a tragic turn, and Derek and Chris end up on trial for murder. While Chris is still a minor and faces only a prison sentence, the older Derek will be put to death if he can't prove his innocence.", "rating": "84", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "Peter Medak", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 1, 2014", "box_office": "$83.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This is deeply moving, and I nearly wept.", "The last 30 minutes of the story are overwhelmingly strong, blending human drama and social history into a series of extremely moving scenes, leading to a brief coda that's as unexpected and audacious as anything seen on a movie screen in years.", "Courtenay slowly works his way into the center of the movie's sympathies. When he embraces his remaining family at the moment of his son's execution, his sorrow seems boundless.", "As the protagonist/victim, Eccleston gives a superb, riveting performance in his feature-film debut, as does Reynolds, another newcomer who deftly handles the role of the gun-crazy and trigger-happy Chris.", "Let Him Have It is unabashedly weighted toward the perspective of the murderer as victim -- a notion that does not enjoy much public currency in our more violent times. But if ever there was a victim of the judicial system, it was Derek Bentley.", "It's the kind of resonant, controlled and moving film that is all but unmakeable in America today. More's the shame.", "The script, by Neal Purvis and Robert Wade, finds enough quirks in its protagonists to lift them above the issues-movie premise. Michael Kamen's atmospheric chamber score is also crucial to the film's success.", "A chiaroscuro drama of unstoppable tragedy.", "Fairness isn't the issue here, dramatic depth is: You don't have to favor capital punishment to feel yourself being manipulated.", "Let Him Have It is strongest in the human interest department and weakest as a thriller.", "The sober, relatively uninspired account of a real-life crime that shook postwar London.", "It does not follow that behind every great miscarriage of justice lies a great movie. Case in point: the well-intentioned but ultimately unsatisfying Let Him Have It.", "This recreation seethes with quiet outrage, building, albeit slowly, to a climax that should put anyone who favours state retribution over rehabilitation to shame.", "With drab-chic production, Christopher Eccleston's marvellous central performance and a pop nostalgia soundtrack, the odious miscarriage of justice comes vividly to life to scandalise anew those unfamiliar with the true facts.", "A superior docudrama about a famous 1952 English murder case.", "It is straightforward and riveting, with an unexpected emotional power.", "A stirring film which leads the viewer to empathetic resolve.", "The picture never seems abstract or tendentious; it's always grounded in something real. Medak's direction is sensitive and blessedly straightforward, and he does remarkable work with the actors.", "Let Him Have It takes one of the most controversial murder trials in postwar Brit history and comes up with a powerful mix of social conscience and solid entertainment.", "Medak's film is an angry story told with great force by very fine actors."], "rating": ["", "", "", "3.5/4", "4/4", "3/4", "3.5/4", "A-", "3/5", "3/5", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "3/4", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Harriet Waugh", "David Sterritt", "Peter Rainer", "Clifford Terry", "Desmond Ryan", "Stephen Hunter", "Michael Upchurch", "Mary Makarushka", "Jay Boyar", "Phillipa Bloom", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Joanne Kaufman", "Matt Glasby", "Alan Jones", "Gene Siskel", "Candice Russell", "", "Terrence Rafferty", "Variety Staff", "Steve Grant"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out"], "date": ["July 19, 2018", "October 28, 2014", "October 28, 2014", "October 28, 2014", "October 28, 2014", "October 28, 2014", "October 28, 2014", "October 28, 2014", "October 28, 2014", "October 28, 2014", "October 28, 2014", "October 28, 2014", "October 28, 2014", "October 28, 2014", "October 28, 2014", "October 28, 2014", "October 28, 2014", "October 28, 2014", "March 26, 2009", "June 24, 2006"]}}
