{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Depressed over her failed dance career, Terry (Claire Bloom) attempts suicide, only to be rescued by Calvero (Charles Chaplin), an impoverished, once-famous stage clown. Calvero revives Terry's health and prospects, and in the process recovers his own self-esteem as well. When Terry proposes marriage, Calvero thinks their age difference is too great, and leaves to become a street clown so that Terry's friendship with a promising young composer (Sydney Chaplin) can instead blossom.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 25m", "director": "Charlie Chaplin", "studio": "CelebratedProductions", "theater_date": "Oct 23, 1952", "dvd_date": "May 23, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Throughout, Chaplin's comedy-drama doesn't produce one belly laugh, but hardly a gesture in it Jacks grace, point, or perfection.", "Limelight plays like a very personal, sincere work from an artist who seems to have accepted the inevitability of changing times and tastes. Sweet, sad, and often amusing, it's the Tramp's last great appearance on film.", "Chaplin might not be \"the tramp\" character from before (in the strictest sense), but his aging clown definitely retains some familiar characteristics.", "To me it seems one of the finest things Chaplin has ever done. Not even an occasional draggy or garrulous episode can detract seriously from the incomparable grace and wit and humanity which abound in this picture...", "Limelight is loaded with excellent song and dance numbers that remind us that life may be tough, but there is no reason to get mired in it.", "With Limelight, for one last, brief moment, it's like old times even as the new age begins and Chaplin relinquishes his crown to the younger generations.", "It was Chaplin's last great film, and it showcases not just a love for the performing arts (she's a ballerina, he's a vaudevillian), but also Chaplin's effortless sentimentality.", "This somewhat autobiographical piece goes heavy on the melodrama and employs humor in short bursts.", "Some have also accused Limelight of being too sentimental, but we'd argue that's part of its charm.", "", "", "What comes through most clearly in Limelight, however, is that Chaplin had come to terms with his life.", "Chaplin, as usual, is the whole show, superb in this swansong statement about his own career and the old-style entertainment he best represented.", "Intended as a tragicomedy, if not a tearjerker, it is a two-thirds bore that comes to life in the last half-hour or so, when the old-master clown stops trying to be pathetic and reverts to his inimitable proper stuff.", "Elements of self parody from the master of slapstick leave you yearning for the early work that made his name. But it's worth a watch to see Chaplin and Keaton in one of few on-screen appearances together.", "Limelight seems stuck in time, even for 1952. The un-ironic pathos and sentimental humanism seems almost quaint in the post-Hitler world. But that's Chaplin for you - a man who lived by, and wrote, his own rules.", "Departing from most forms of Hollywood stereotype, the film has a flavor all its own in the sincere quality of the story anent the onetime great vaudemime and his rescue of a femme ballet student.", "", "Chaplin's least funny film.", "Premiering in 1952 when Chaplin was 63 years old, this melancholy reverie is a heartfelt expression of nostalgia for the Edwardian London music-halls of his youth, rich with deeply personal sentiment and warmly realized autobiographical fantasy."], "rating": ["", "3.5/5", "8/10", "", "", "", "3/4", "3/4", "7/10", "3/4", "3/5", "3.5/4", "4/4", "", "4/5", "4.5/5", "", "4/5", "B-", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Manny Farber", "Nicholas Bell", "Mike Massie", "Clyde Gilmour", "Michael J.
