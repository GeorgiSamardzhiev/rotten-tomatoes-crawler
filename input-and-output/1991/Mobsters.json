{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Loosely based on real historical figures, this drama focuses on the empire built by enterprising young criminals Lucky Luciano (Christian Slater) and Meyer Lansky (Patrick Dempsey). Along with Bugsy Siegel (Richard Grieco) and Frank Costello (Costas Mandylor), Luciano and Lansky establish a revitalized mob in New York City, effectively displacing their predecessors. Despite the gangsters' humble beginnings on the streets, they eventually rise to control much of the city.", "rating": "6", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Michael Karbelnikoff", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 18, 2014", "box_office": "$19.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["To say that production designer Richard Sylbert, costume designer Ellen Mirojnick and cinematographer Lajos Koltai give the settings a handsome, authentic look is like saying that the Titanic had nice chandeliers.", "It is extraordinary that, with gangster-era America providing such a natural source of drama, director Michael Karbelnikoff should turn gritty reality into such an empty tale.", "Although things like character development are sometimes lost in the crossfire, the lead actors have enough charm to sustain the film.", "It's an excuse for the latest crop of media-spawned personalities -- the male equivalent of starlets -- to invade the heavy-duty genre of the gangster film. They don't come up to Cagney's spats.", "Mobsters is a bloody little fairy tale that makes good guys out of Lucky Luciano, Frank Costello, Bugsy Siegel and Meyer Lansky. According to the film, a largely plodding affair, they were just four kids who liked to kill people once in a while.", "Mobsters looks like it was made by people who have seen too many gangster films for people who haven't seen any. There isn't a breath of life in the filmmaking.", "Slater and Dempsey bring to the film whatever shallow depth Mobsters occasionally exhibits.", "The virtue of GoodFellas was that it took the glamor out of mob sagas, and it's going to take a picture a lot better than Mobsters to put it back in.", "In an attempt to find the origins of infamous gangsters Charlie \"Lucky\" Luciano, Meyer Lansky, Frank Costello and Benny \"Bugsy\" Siegel, Karbelnikoff has rendered lame caricatures instead of meaty characters.", "A potboiler in the quick-and-dirty tradition of the B movies of the '30s, it may not win any Oscars or garner rave reviews, but it's consistently entertaining, nevertheless.", "A hollow concept gussied up with a few big names, a pretty set and some fancy clothes.", "Despite competent production, despite-or perhaps because of-a high and inventively mutilated body count, the film is ultimately boring.", "It feels like a history lesson from a particularly inept substitute teacher, hitting only a few highlights before it returns to a flat read of gangster specifics.", "One of the most fogettable theatrical releases of 1991.", "High concept, sleek stylishness, low content.", "The seemingly can't-miss premise of teen-heartthrob gangsters gets lost in self-important direction, a shoddy script and muddled storytelling.", "", "A noisy, silly, rather immature film.", "", ""], "rating": ["", "2/5", "3/5", "", "1/4", "", "2/4", "2/4", "", "4/5", "1/4", "2/4", "C+", "2/4", "", "", "2/5", "", "1/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Ralph Novak", "John Marriott", "Jo Berry", "Michael Sragow", "Lou Cedrone", "Peter Rainer", "Carrie Rickey", "Gary Thompson", "Roger Hurlburt", "Jay Boyar", "Michael Upchurch", "Johanna Steinmetz", "Brian Orndorf", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Variety Staff", "Frank Swietek", "Steve Grant", "Emanuel Levy", "Daniel M.
