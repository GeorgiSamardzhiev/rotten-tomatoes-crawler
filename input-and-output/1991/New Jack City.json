{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Drug tycoon Nino Brown (Wesley Snipes) and his minions, known collectively as the Cash Money Brothers, have rapidly risen to the top of the New York City narcotics trade. Under Nino's heartless leadership, the drug operation has grown into a multimillion-dollar empire. Scotty (Ice-T) and Nick (Judd Nelson), two police officers who know their way around the streets of Harlem, aim to bring Nino and his cohorts down. To do so, though, they'll have to play by Nino's rules and go undercover.", "rating": "77", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Mario Van Peebles", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,JacmacFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 31, 2008", "box_office": "$44.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...has all the energy you could want from a B-picture with A-picture aspirations...", "Whilst not as analytical about the debate on drugs like Soderbergh's Traffic, there is much to think about and take from a still-enjoyable movie.", "", "OK Van Peebles flick featuring Snipes.", "We all know New Jack City is making the right statement on drugs, racism, the system, etc. But the fact is it's not very good.", "Though this often plays like a 70s cop show, it became a prototype for the bling-heavy gangsta melodramas of the 90s.", "Filmmakers pull off a provocative, pulsating update on gangster pics with this action-laden epic about the rise and fall of an inner city crack dealer.", "", "A cynical director, Van Peebles has style to burn, but his work is too flashy to make sense.
