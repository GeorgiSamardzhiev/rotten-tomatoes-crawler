{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Jonathan Harker is sent away to Count Dracula's castle to sell him a house in Virna, where he lives. But Count Dracula is a vampire, an undead ghoul living off men's blood.

Nice cinematography and atmosphere", "The historic accuracy of Henning Von Gierke's sets, Gisela Storch's costumes, and Jorg Schmidt-Reitwein's breathtaking photographyt all combine for the perfect dramatic illusion.", "Werner Herzog has created for himself and cinephiles in general a superb spectacle. [Full Review in Spanish]", "More an homage than a remake, Nosferatu the Vampyre keeps the spirit of the original while simultaneously feeling decidedly Herzog-esque in the best kind of way.", "Even the film's opening shots carry more meaning than just a creepy set-piece.", "Not a single drop of blood is wasted here, and the film's elegantly tragic narrative features not one moment of wasted motion.", "A stark statement about how sometimes a brief life filled with warmth, love, beauty and belonging is better than an endless one filled with nothing but want.", "Werner Herzog's eerie color remake of F.W. Murnau's original vampire classic (itself an unauthorized version of Bram Stoker's Dracula) is at once faithful to Murnau's film and quintessentially Herzogian.", "An evocative exercise in alienation and existential dread, Herzog masterfully tackles one of the greatest gothic stories ever with Nosferatu the Vampyre with the unforgettable (as always) Klaus Kinski as the titular blood-sucker.", "It's a curious mix: at times deliriously hammy, at others melancholy, contemplative and oddly beautiful.", "Worth seeing for the visuals, then, but minor Herzog.", "Madness and death hang over Herzog's Wagner-scored vision like a black cloud, while Kinski adds much poignancy to Dracula, the lonely immortal.", "Nosferatu is at least as much a tribute to surrealist pioneer Luis Bunuel as it is to Murnau.", "Herzog, cinematographer Jorg Schmidt-Reitwein and production designer Henning von Gierke conjure a near-endless stream of arresting images.", "Werner Herzog's venture to Transylvania seems as much inspired by German romantic art (Caspar David Friedrich, especially) as by Bram Stoker or Bela Lugosi.", "Nothing goes bang in the night. Rather there is a continuous unsettling drone screech of everything going wrong all the way through.", "Nosferatu the Vampyre comes across as the perfect conflation of everything that makes Werner Herzog Werner Herzog.", "This is Herzog's journey to the heart of darkness, a film that specifically echoes his earlier offerings The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser and his South American odyssey Aguirre, Wrath of God.", "Slowed down to a nightmare crawl, it's one of its director's most bizarre, resonant and fascinating films."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "1", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "", "B+", "5/5", "", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Dennis Harvey", "Rachel Wagner", "Diana Goldfarb", "Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos", "C.H.
