{"metadata": {"synopsis": "British expatriate Jim Wormold (Alec Guinness) runs a vacuum cleaner store in Havana, Cuba. He has promised his vain daughter, Milly (Jo Morrow), a horse and a country club membership, which leaves him desperate for money.

As a result, certain half-way stretches of dialogue become tedious to watch.", "The mixture of mayhem and heehaw is particularly tricky to handle, and not even the sure hand of Director Reed has always achieved a smooth blend.", "As hilarious as it is absurd, this droll comedy about spies in Cuba stars the prodigiously talented Guinness.", "So much potential in casting, script etc... but the translation from the book didn't quite make sense on screen.", "At once very much of its time and surprisingly modern and relevant to today.", "... a dryly witty satire of the spy game.", "This is a quirky, often quite sardonic little film that starts off as a mild and witty comedy before shifting gears and becoming almost James Bond-like.", "Polished, diverting entertainment, brilliant in its comedy but falling apart towards the end when undertones of drama, tragedy and message crop up.", "Incredibly droll, this Graham Greene-scripted black comedy offers a can't miss premise.", "A real 'winds of change' film, with traditional values crumbling in the heat of pre-revolutionary Cuba.
