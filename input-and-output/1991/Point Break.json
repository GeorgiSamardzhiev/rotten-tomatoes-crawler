{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After a string of bizarre bank robberies in Southern California, with the crooks donning masks of various former presidents, a federal agent, Johnny Utah (Keanu Reeves), infiltrates the suspected gang. But this is no ordinary group of robbers. They're surfers -- led by the charismatic Bodhi (Patrick Swayze) -- who are addicted to the rush of thievery. But when Utah falls in love with a female surfer, Tyler (Lori Petty), who is close to the gang, it complicates his sense of duty.", "rating": "70", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 2m", "director": "Kathryn Bigelow", "studio": "20thCenturyFox", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 1, 2016", "box_office": "$40.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Bigelow makes all this fun, tragic, and yes, deeply sexy without lingering too much on the bodies of the various surfers, male or female.", "Risky acts through increasingly audacious sequences, culminating in one of the most outstanding moments ever seen in the genre.

Did the tape recorder go on the blitz at the story conferences? Was there a fire in the editing room?", "This is a very macho movie, and if the better film schools are looking for a contemporary film that very keenly exemplifies the marriage of sound and shoot, this is it.", "Point Break is the best movie about cops, robbers, surfing and sky diving that you're likely to see.", "", "The essence of movie remains unsullied, and with every viewing comes fresh details and a new appreciation for the film's fearlessness and originality in the midst of all of the cop formula.", "Quaint in its depiction of an alternative lifestyle, yet still an above average, really quite vicious action thriller.", "...an above-average actioner...", "Consistently stylish, dumb, and entertaining.", "", "Pretty fair action in Swayze-Reeves starrer.", "Keanu Reeves is Johnny Utah.
