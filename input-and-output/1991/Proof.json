{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Catherine (Gwyneth Paltrow) is a 27-year-old grieving after the loss of her father (Anthony Hopkins), a genius mathematician whose mind gradually deteriorated from mental illness. With her sister, Claire (Hope Davis), urging Catherine to leave their family home, and an ambitious student (Jake Gyllenhaal) searching through her father's notes, Catherine struggles to keep her composure and her sanity in this drama adapted from the stage play by David Auburn.", "rating": "62", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "John Madden", "studio": "Hart-SharpEntertainment", "theater_date": "Sep 23, 2005", "dvd_date": "Oct 8, 2016", "box_office": "$7.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An unlovely film about an unlovely group of people.", "It's that breed of verbal swordplay that so impresses on stage while seeming so redundant and brittle on screen.", "... Proof seems like no more than a fraction of a cinematic experience, a string of emotional calculations that fails to provide a satisfying solution.", "Proof is a smart film, but it tries too hard. It wears its heart on its sleeve, and the pathos becomes a bit much because there is little to balance it out.", "A limp, and utterly pointless melodrama that's never as intelligent as it thinks.", "Timid staging faithful adaptation = no cinema", "offers a convincing demonstration of the theorem that good writing and sensitive performances can equal an engaging and nuanced piece of cinema.", "Madden stages the action with a minimum of imagination and gets a career-worst performance out of Davis in a key role, but the material still sputters to life on the strength of the writing and Paltrow's commitment to the part.", "full review in Greek", "As a story about personal and family dysfunction, and about coming to terms with life's uncertainties, Proof isn't bad.", "A subtle, slow-burning mystery that does justice to its themes of identity, sanity and sacrifice.", "An elegant adaptation to the screen, with the play's qualities largely intact and great performances from Paltrow and Hope Davis, as her sister. Jake Gyllenhaal and Anthony Hopkins complete a dream cast.", "Proof is something of a puzzle, an all-star drama that has the feel of a Sunday afternoon film. Think curiosity, not must see.", "Intense and compelling, Proof is an absorbing film that shows the intricacies of the human mind are as complex as a mathematical equation.", "", "Smart, well-acted, and wonderfully directed.", "Sure, the play won the Pulitzer Prize, but that doesn't mean it makes a great film, in my opinion. Maybe it just works better on the stage.", "We are invited to believe that Hopkins, Paltrow and Gyllenhaal all have, in their various ways, alpha-brains. They look to me like they couldn't recite the three-times-table without smoke coming out of their ears.", "Paltrow stars as a woman who may or may not be around the twist.
