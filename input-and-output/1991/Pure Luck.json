What is surprising is that veteran investigator Raymond Campanella (Danny Glover) can't find her. Then an executive at Valerie's father's company has the idea to send Proctor (Martin Short) from accounting along with Raymond. Proctor, it turns out, also possesses terrible luck -- and is sure to tumble into the same mess Valerie did.", "rating": "9", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "Nadia Tass", "studio": "UniversalPictures,SeanDanielCompany", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 23, 2016", "box_office": "$21.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Moronic slapstick buddy comedy.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "This is not a bad idea for a movie.
