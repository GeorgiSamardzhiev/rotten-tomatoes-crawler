{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Almost 50 years after the American nuclear attack on Nagasaki during World War II, the horrific incident still shapes the life of Kane (Sachiko Murase), an elderly woman who lost her husband and several siblings in the bombing. One summer, Kane learns that her older brother is close to death in Hawaii. Kane's nephew, Clark (Richard Gere), travels to Nagasaki to help bring her there, but Kane, who still harbors hostility toward America, is unsure about the trip.", "rating": "60", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Akira Kurosawa", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 1, 2003", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There is little drama in all of this, but Kurosawa still knows how to set out a strong ending.", "Absorbing pacifist drama, looks at the links between East and West.", "These days, people are more interested in Kurosawa than he is in being Kurosawa.", "Sad to say, it is far from a major statement from one of our greatest living directors.", "A touching heartfelt film by the octogenarian legendary Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa.", "Rhapsody in August is an old man's film in the best possible sense. Though it stares death straight in the face, it is primarily interested in life.", "There's more narrative movement here than in Dreams, but the pedagogic humanism still gets bogged down in facile simplification.", "", "A beautiful reminder from octogenarian Akira Kurosawa that he's still the master.", "Mr. Gere gives a good, self-effacing performance in a role that's a little unreal. He speaks his own Japanese dialogue easily and is at the center of one of Mr. Kurosawa's most breathtaking moments.", "It's proof, as if anyone needed it, that at 82, Kurosawa still possesses all of his artistic filmmaking powers.", "Kurosawa's lovely meditation on the nature of American-Japanese relations could not come at a better time.", "Plain and simple, Rhapsody is mediocre pap. It's nothing compared with his previous work.", "A delicately nuanced film about remembrance -- so delicate, perhaps, that it's not terribly memorable itself.", "It is not one of his great films, but shows him thoughtfully trying to come to peace with the central event of his times."], "rating": ["", "", "", "2.5/4", "B+", "", "", "2/5", "", "4/5", "3.5/4", "3/5", "", "", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Malcolm Johnson", "Michael E.
