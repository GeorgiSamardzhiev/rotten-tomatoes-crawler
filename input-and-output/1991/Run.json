After this latest use of Munchausen syndrome by proxy, though, it might be time to retire that storytelling device.", "Clocking in at an economical 90 minutes, [Run] traverses through familiar beats, but its taut pacing and all-in performances elevate it well-above standard thriller fare.", "We marinate in the juiciest, briniest details and soak up the nail-biting, will-she-make-it moments.", "[A] worn path. [Full review in Spanish]", "... this murky domestic thriller provides fair entertainment, stepping up what was presented in 2018 with the disappointing Searching.", "Run isn't a masterpiece, and the movie has some ideas that are recycled from other films, but it's a satisfying thriller for anyone intrigued by stories about one family member pitted against another.", "Run is a worthy follow-up to Searching for Chaganty, a director who knows how to ratchet up the tension when it counts.", "It's far from a terrible movie, but I'm not sure what the takeaway is meant to be.", "Aneesh Chaganty crucially recognized the potential issue of having able-bodied filmmakers tell a disabled story.", "Paulson will be fine after this misstep. Ditto Allen, who could not be a more appealing lead or a resourceful damsel-in-distress.", "A quick-paced thriller that gets right to the action. There is high tension throughout that will have you on the edge of your seat, with great performances by the two leads.", "An asphyxiating and twisted fun thriller. [Full Review in Spanish]", "One of the most chilling things about Run is pondering just how many parents in the audience might sympathize with Diane a little and just how far into the movie they might get before that sympathy runs out.", "...Run is one of those movies you recommend to friends...it feels like a personal discovery.", "[Ahsoka is] a great character, and I thought Rosario Dawson did a good job bringing her to life.", "This film is so achingly gorgeous that we don't want this party to end.", "I highly recommend checking it out. As long as you don't feel the need, like Chloe, to ask too many pesky questions.", "Meat-and-potatoes thriller filmmaking of the first order.", "A couple of things elevate Run above the average.", "Dark domestic thriller has violence, mature themes."], "rating": ["", "B", "", "2/5", "3/5", "", "3.5/5", "2.5/4", "B+", "2/5", "A", "3.5/5", "", "4/5", "", "4/5", "", "3.5/5", "B-", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Alex Bentley", "Jeffrey Zhang", "Candice McMillan", "Miguel Romero Fern\u00e1ndez", "Filipe Freitas", "Carla Hay", "Trace Thurman", "Steven Prokopy", "Alicja Johnson", "David Fear", "Chauncey K.
