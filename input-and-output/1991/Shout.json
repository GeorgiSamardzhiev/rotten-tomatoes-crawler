{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A stranger shows up in a Texas town in 1955. His name is Jack Cabe (John Travolta), and he's been hired as the music teacher at the Benedict Boys Home. Before long, he's upsetting the institution's staid atmosphere by giving his students a primer in rock 'n' roll. Cabe's fresh approach captures the interest of local misfit Jesse Tucker (James Walters), but earns him the rancor of school bigwig Eugene Benedict (Richard Jordan). As his profile rises, Cabe risks exposing a secret from his past.", "rating": "39", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 29m", "director": "Jeffrey Hornaday", "studio": "RobertSimondsProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 15, 2016", "box_office": "$3.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "Moves to a boppy beat...Travolta's in good form", "", ""], "rating": ["2/5", "3/5", "1/5", "0/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Emanuel Levy", "Caffeinated Clint", "Scott Weinberg", "Marjorie Baumgarten"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Moviehole", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Austin Chronicle"], "date": ["August 19, 2005", "March 11, 2005", "July 26, 2002", "January 1, 2000"]}}
