{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Dave Marshak (Dean Cameron) and his friends are a pack of highly skilled skiers and devoted party animals. On the slopes, they are known as \"Section 8.\" But their reputation is at risk when a ski school of snobs -- headed by pompous and preppy Reid Janssens (Mark Thomas Miller) -- shows up looking to win the end-of-season downhill competition. Now, the stakes have never been higher because, if Section 8 is beaten, they'll lose more than bragging rights. They'll also lose their jobs.", "rating": "59", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 31m", "director": "Damian Lee", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 15, 2017", "box_office": "$18.5K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": [""], "rating": ["2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten"], "critic": ["Oz"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com"], "date": ["January 13, 2003"]}}
