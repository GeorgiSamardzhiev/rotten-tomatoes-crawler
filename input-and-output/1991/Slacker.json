{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Austin, Texas, is an Eden for the young and unambitious, from the enthusiastically eccentric to the dangerously apathetic. Here, the nobly lazy can eschew responsibility in favor of nursing their esoteric obsessions. The locals include a backseat philosopher (Richard Linklater) who passionately expounds on his dream theories to a seemingly comatose cabbie (Rudy Basquez), a young woman who tries to hawk Madonna's Pap test to anyone who will listen and a kindly old anarchist looking for recruits.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Richard Linklater", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 18, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Although its structure seems novel to me from a formal point of view, I am not captivated by the lives of those characters that it presents in a simple day in Austin, Texas.
