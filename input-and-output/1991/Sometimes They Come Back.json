But director Tom McLoughlin keeps the essential concept lashed together pretty tightly.", "[Tim] Matheson's performance is truly moving, and the drama of Sometimes They Come Back is stronger stuff than most TV movies.", "Sometimes They Come Back is a film that had the potential for greatness but never really seemed to get on track. The acting was solid, the special effects were effective, but it was the story that never caught on.", "This is Grade \"B\" Stephen King with nothing-special special effects. There is only one shocking monster-face and no creepy-crawlies.", "One of Stephen King's adaptations that involves less gore and more thrills, this outing relies on solid performances with [Tim] Matheson and [Brooke] Adams delivering while the script is faithful to the book.", "Sometimes They Come Back is a harmless way to spend ninety minutes but it's really only for the determined King completist.", "While director Tom McLoughlin aims to engross and gross-out in equal measure, the numerous plot inconsistencies scupper everyone's good intentions.", "What ensues strictly follows the King formula, entertaining with thrills, murders, facing-up-to-fear philosophizing and snappy lines.", "A painfully average film, its classic horror status somewhat baffling.
