{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In early 1963, right before the onset of full-fledged Beatlemania, John Lennon (Ian Hart) and Beatles manager Brian Epstein (David Angus) take a four-day holiday in Barcelona. Lennon, the working-class street tough, and Epstein, the dapper homosexual, make for unlikely friends, but their relationship blossoms over the vacation. Epstein harbors romantic feelings for his friend and client, but Lennon is more interested in the starstruck stewardess who finds her way to their hotel.", "rating": "80", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h", "director": "Christopher Munch", "studio": "", "theater_date": "Mar 1, 2019", "dvd_date": "Jul 4, 2019", "box_office": "$1.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A dynamic and frank depiction of friendship and same-sex attraction that's well worth revisiting.", "Its extreme low-budget charms elude this spectator.", "[Writer/director Christopher Munch] is greatly aided by Ian Hart's deft impersonation of the cocky yet sensitive Lennon and David Angus's considered portrayal of the tortured Epstein.", "Easily the most engaging fiction film made about The Beatles.", "It's short (57 minutes) and sweet.", "Even though the film runs just shy of an hour, the production values equal that of a studio blockbuster!", "All these years later, this landmark of Queer Cinema still has power, even if it seems downright quaint.", "The film delivers intellectual archeology, a rediscovery of states of mind and mood that shook the world; M\u00fcnch's calm, contemplative, and quietly astonished direction vibrates with the historic excitement of the moment.", "John Lennon and his manager Epstein's trip to Barcelona is the only factual element in Munch's original film, an evocative meditation on the friendship between two men who could not have been more different.", "A sharp, concise, evocative film about friendship, about its limitations and the recognition of those limitations.", "John Lennon and Brian Epstein must have been fascinating people, so to force these two unique men to have conversations that are beyond banal is incredibly bizarre.", "", "Interesting, but flawed.", "Ever wondered what might have happened when John Lennon and his manager Brian Epstein spent four days together in Barcelona, just before the Beatles hit it big?
