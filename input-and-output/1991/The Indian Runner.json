{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After getting into trouble with the law, violence-prone Frank Roberts (Viggo Mortensen) seeks help from his brother Joe (David Morse), an even-tempered policeman. Frank hopes to start fresh, and his brother has faith that he can do it. So Joe agrees to let Frank stay -- despite the admonitions of his wife, Maria (Valeria Golino), who would rather not have Frank in the house. And though he performs well at first, Frank's inner turmoil eventually erupts, creating chaos in their once tranquil home.", "rating": "74", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 6m", "director": "Sean Penn", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 18, 2017", "box_office": "$152.9K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The film is slow and pretentious, but it's a feature debut and Sean Penn, a distinguished actor, is good with his cast.", "Rambling, indulgent and joltingly raw at times, Sean Penn's first outing as a director takes a fair amount of patience to get through but has an integrity that intermittently serves it well.", "Muscular if overwrought drama with great performances.", "Penn's first project as writer/director is a film out of time, drenched in an overbearing '60s world-view which veers between the dated and the dopey.", "", "", "", "Probes the love/hate relationship between two brothers destined to follow different stars.", "", "Penn's generosity to his actors is welcome, and Mortensen and Morse make the most of it with substantial performances, but a tighter reign might have livened up a film that at times becomes a little ponderous.", "", "Loose, rambling and sometimes rudderless as it is, \"The Indian Runner\" has a fundamental honesty that gives it real substance.", "", "", "", "Although the camera always gives precedence to the actor, Penn is not just merely a manipulator of theatrics.
