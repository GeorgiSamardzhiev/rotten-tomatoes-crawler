{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Young Jakie Rabinowitz (Bobby Gordon) loves jazz and ragtime, and wants to be a performer. But his father (Warner Oland) is a cantor, and he orders his son to carry on the family tradition. Jakie tries his hand anyway, only to be discovered by neighbor Moisha Yudelson (Otto Lederer) and kicked out of the house. A decade later, an older Jakie (Al Jolson) has followed his dream, changed his name and found love with performer Mary (May McAvoy), but he still wants to win his father over.", "rating": "75", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Alan Crosland", "studio": "WarnerBros.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2009", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's a touch overdramatic, but momentous nonetheless.", "Of its time, surely, 'The Jazz Singer' is nevertheless better than one expects going in.", "A film whose appeal is almost solely historical, for a multitude of reasons.", "The Jazz Singer is not a good picture artistically, but it's historically significant and Al Johnson is truly entertaining", "The Jazz Singer is a shallow attempt by a powerful group of straying Jews to clear their consciences.", "By today's standards, The Jazz Singer is mawkish, crudely filmed, and full of schmaltz. Yet it remains fascinating in its historical value, not only for its technical innovation.", "In cities where the Vitaphone can be installed and reproduce his voice this picture will eminently repay attendance.", "Undoubtedly the best thing Vitaphone has ever put on the screen.", "An overrated cinematic turd, and an embarrassment to Jazz.", "", "There's one thing that neither Neil Diamond nor Danny Thomas nor even Jerry Lewis had in their versions: the unrivaled showmanship and charisma of Al Jolson.", "...there's no taking away from the movie's heart and Jolson's singing.
