{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Based on the novel by Edward Lewis Wallant, this drama focuses on former professor Sol Nazerman (Rod Steiger), the survivor of a German concentration camp who now runs a pawn shop in East Harlem. Having witnessed his family's death at the hands of the Nazis, he is embittered toward humanity and pushes away anyone around him, including his young Puerto Rican employee, Jesus (Jaime Sanchez). As Nazerman contends with his internal conflicts, the harsh realities of the city affect his life as well.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "Sidney Lumet", "studio": "LandauCompany", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 9, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One of Lumet's best films, presented with a powerful performance from Rod Steiger. [Full review in Spanish]", "[The Pawnbroker] is a brilliant cinema achievement.

While some instinct leads him to undertake tremendously promising projects, he brings to those projects only a stunning literal-mindedness.", "It is our statement that Nazerman is as much Lumet's creation as Steigers: mood and visuals combine with the performance to present a screen creation wholly worthy of Emil Janning's work with Von Sternberg in Blue Angel.", "The Pawnbroker seemed to me a bore and a phony, a vulgarization of a serious theme, an exploitation of cinematic \"effects\" used without taste or intelligence.", "If The Pawnbroker is nasty, the reason is that director Sidney Lumet consistently overplays his hand. Apart from a magnificent virtuoso performance by Rod Steiger - that incredibly versatile actor - the movie has nothing to do with art.", "The Pawnbroker is a paradoxically obsessed with death, yet roaring with life, a jazzy urban tragedy that sees shadows of the Holocaust in the suffering and exploitation of the dead-eyed souls of East Harlem.", "The film makes its point with narrative economy and emotional sophistication in a socially complex contemporary context.", "creates some haunting images and gives Rod Steiger a chance to blossom", "An unpleasant, solemn and overwrought melodrama about an embittered Jewish Holocaust survivor still haunted by his stay in Auschwitz.", "One of the first Hollywood films to deal with the Holocaust, The Pawnbroker is thematically and stylistically innovative, borrowing some of its devices from the French New Wave, such as brief flashbacks, stylized b/w imagery, and jazzy score.", "", "", "", "", "Dramatizes the psychological impact of the Nazi concentration camps, while drawing parallels to contemporary conditions of New York City ghetto life"], "rating": ["8/10", "", "9/10", "", "", "", "", "4.5/5", "8", "B", "B-", "A-", "5/5", "3/5", "4/5", "5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Yasser Medina", "William J.
