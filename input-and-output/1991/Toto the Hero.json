{"metadata": {"synopsis": "From his bed in a retirement home, Thomas (Michel Bouquet) looks back with resentment on his life. He once dreamed of being a secret agent and instead became an unexceptional bureaucrat, but he clings to the idea that things might have been different but for one crucial event. Thomas believes he and another baby were switched at birth, thus granting his lifelong rival, Alfred (Peter Bohlke), an undeserved life of wealth and privilege. Still jealous, Thomas decides to finally settle the score.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 34m", "director": "Jaco Van Dormael", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$21.7K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Toto is an unreliable narrator and as he looks back through his life it becomes increasingly difficult to differentiate between fact, memory and reality.", "Van Dormael emerges as one of the most original and inventive of contemporary European filmmakers, a deadpan director-writer full of kicks and tricks.", "Belgian director Jaco Van Dormael makes his dazzlingly inventive debut with this intricately constructed tale of an old man.", "", "", "", "", "An audacious Belgian film with a creative exploration of the primal role of fantasy in our lives", "", "", "This is an interesting film, but I would have liked it more, I think, if it had been more bitter and unforgiving; if someone like Bunuel had directed it.", ""], "rating": ["", "", "", "4.5/5", "5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "4.5/5", "2.5/4", "4.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Rob Aldam", "Malcolm Johnson", "David Ansen", "Jennie Kermode", "Emanuel Levy", "", "Rob Blackwelder", "Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat", "Mark R.
