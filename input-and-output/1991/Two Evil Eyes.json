Romero's segment doesn't pull its own weight. While it is creepy in spots, the majority of the story is overlong and ho-hum in the execution.", "It is amazing what Argento has been able to do in his 65-minute \"The Black Cat,\" which is the more ingenious--and gory--of the two parts.", "Playing out like a mediocre episode of Tales From The Crypt, it's slow, largely uneventful and not particularly exciting when something does happen... The Black Cat is a much more solid film, with a considerably better screenplay and some excellent acting", "The one directed by Argento is clearly better than Romero's.", "I wasn't too surprised to find that I liked both parts of this film, regardless of the negative buzz.", "", "", "Cool cats kill!", "It's a tough call as to which director's episode is lamer.", "", "You can't go too wrong with these directors.
