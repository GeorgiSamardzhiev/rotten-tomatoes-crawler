{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Following a broken engagement, sometime photographer Leonard Kraditor (Joaquin Phoenix) moves in with his parents in Brighton Beach. He soon becomes involved with Sandra (Vinessa Shaw), an honest and sensible young woman. They appear to be a perfect match, then Michelle (Gwyneth Paltrow) enters the picture.

[Full review in Spanish]", "Joaquin Phoenix stars-and delivers his most self-scourging performance-in James Gray's taut and melancholy Brighton Beach romance.", "But the true beauty of Two Lovers is the tightly constructed plot and accurately conceived emotions of this engaging ensemble piece.", "The whole film feels like a throwback, at once swooningly romantic and achingly sad.", "Everything about this quietly beautiful film is understated - the performances, the score and, most of all, the inner turmoil that easily can mean life or death for the most sensitive among us.", "James Gray has exactly what American cinema needs-sincerity. Gray deals in melodrama-and male melodrama at that-but treats it with a solemn seriousness that makes one believe again in the earnestness of American genre cinema.", "", "What made the filmmakers come up with such a 1959 scenario? Better yet, how did they make this hoary plot so damned entertaining? Must be movie magic.", "", "Please, don't be fooled by this. It's all showboating scenes, pretentious ideals and NO realism whatsoever.", "I can't stop thinking about Leonard, how I want him to be free, living an authentic life ... but also to to remain under supervision so he won't mess himself up. Phoenix is brilliant here.", "We know the characters better than they know themselves", "... it's instructive to view director/co-writer ... James Gray's take on the effects of private infidelity.", "Tells a pretty old story but gets you hooked on its atmosphere and how it embellishes the heady sensation of shedding the coldness of solitude and depression with the warmth of walking through a new romance.", "Sure, Phoenix's current foray to hip-hop is uncomfortably bizarre to behold, but at least it's not as painfully boring and predictable as what he claims is his last film.", "Lugubrious affair involving a young man suffering from weltschmerz and the two women he loves set in Brighton Beach.", "This is supposed to be a romantic drama, but Woody Allen could have made a very funny film out of this exact same story.", "Trying, unwieldy, and affecting"], "rating": ["", "", "6/10", "", "", "3/4", "3/4", "", "4/5", "", "A", "1/5", "7.5/10", "2.5/4", "4/5", "7/10", "2/4", "", "C+", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Simran Hans", "Jason Best", "Yasser Medina", "Richard Brody", "Felicia Feaster", "Matthew Lucas", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Daniel Kasman", "Hank Sartin", "Kelly Vance", "Christine Champ", "Mike Edwards", "Jeffrey Overstreet", "Marty Mapes", "James Wegg", "Jeffrey Chen", "Brandy McDonnell", "Louis Proyect", "Robert Roten", "Fernando F.
