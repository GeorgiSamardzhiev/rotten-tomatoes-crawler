{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Born to poor parents, Becky Sharp (Reese Witherspoon) has always aspired to be a member of England's upper classes. Leaving her boarding school and best friend, Amelia (Romola Garai), behind, Becky associates herself with the Crawleys, eventually falling in love with their son, Rawdon (James Purefoy). The marriage is happy at first, but deteriorates when Rawdon's fortune dwindles. Becky is then supported by the lecherous Marquess of Steyne (Gabriel Byrne), whose motives are less than pure.", "rating": "50", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 20m", "director": "Mira Nair", "studio": "USAFilms,FocusFeatures", "theater_date": "Sep 1, 2004", "dvd_date": "Feb 12, 2014", "box_office": "$16.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The brilliance of Nair's vision is how she takes the images, references, and suggestions of India latent in the original text and brings them to the ultimate fore.", "Directed by Mira Nair, although sumptuous in scope thanks to the sets and costumes, the film is convoluted and confusing.", "Hardly high-drama, but it's gently satirical and arguably represents the spirit of Thackeray's mischievous attitude to high society better than Kubrick's overwrought Barry Lyndon.", "Olivia Cooke's interpretation is probably the best Becky Sharp yet: She's intensely charismatic, with a little more bite, and toes the line between being faithful to the book and teasing out more modern feminist themes a little more smoothly.", "Witherspoon could have made something of Vanity Fair if Nair had reinvented the novel the way the makers of Clueless reinvented Emma. Instead, she exploited it.", "This Vanity Fair delights the eye, but Nair may be too much the humanist for her own good: she hasn't the instinct for the kill.", "Though visually stunning, director Mira Nair's abridged tale never engages.", "Lovely literary adaptation with class issues, battle scenes.", "From the ostentatious costumes by designer Beatrix Aruna Pasztor (\"Wonder Boys\") to the annoying male hairstyles that permeate every scene, \"Vanity Fair\" is a movie that depends on its overall visual effect to hypnotize audiences into overlooking the film", "Costumes and cinematography are sumptuous, but Thackeray's elegant wit gives way to something bawdier and less subtle.", "Yay! England sucks and India is cool! Well, except for that troublesome caste system, of course.", "In Vanity Fair's universe without heroes, shameless central character Becky Sharp would have surely felt supremely at home stuck on Temptation Island, or in the boardroom of The Apprentice.", "To our utter delight, these stories and messages are told with superb acting, amazing costumes that burst with color and texture, and dazzling locales.", "A serious misfire, as the saccharine heroine and dazzling Indian influences sideline the satire in this adaptation of Thackeray's classic.", "Es una slida adaptacin de la novela de Thackeray por la que bien vale la pena pagar el boleto.", "Becky's adept maneuvering through upper society's pitfalls is sometimes muddled from too many characters and too little explanation, but Witherspoon remains fun to watch...", "Not at all the stiff costume drama bore I thought this movie was going to be.", "Witherspoon is the only thing that kept me watching Vanity Fair even as my eyelids morphed into anvils.", "Vanity Fair is an enjoyable enough film but its not a patch on the book!", "Lacking a character we really care about, we're left floundering in a mud puddle of human misbehavior.
