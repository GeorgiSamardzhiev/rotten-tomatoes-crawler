While this low-budget Tale of Winter may seem simple, it's a masterly simplicity.", "As usual, Rohmer works magic with his generally unfamiliar casts, drawing from them more they perhaps realize they're yielding.", "Rohmer has become such a master of his chosen classic genre -- the crystalline philosophical tale of character and romantic choice -- that this is a nearly perfect work, in performance as well as execution.", "Rarely has this great filmmaker been so successful at blending his most serious concerns with such engaging entertainment.", "This witty adult fairy tale, set in the heart of the callous city, is a joy to behold thanks to the naturalism of its performances and the sublime subtlety of its direction.", "Eric Rohmer's A Tale of Winter is a beautifully buoyant film, both intellectually challenging and rapturously romantic.", "With A Tale of Springtime and A Tale of Winter, Eric Rohmer has given us a pair of wonderful motion pictures... I wonder what Summer and Autumn will bring.", "It has, as ever, enormous compassion, wit and insight, and its ending is exquisitely affecting.", "", "At least part of the comic appeal of Mr. Rohmer's work is the complete confidence, clarity and decisiveness with which he dramatizes the utter confusion of his emotionally besieged heroines.", "The myriad small joys and failures of everyday life are the director's homeland, piecing together a naturalistic, redemptive and compassionate story.", "", "A difficult film to like.", "A Rohmer film is a flavor that, once tasted, cannot be mistaken.", "Felicie's naive faith pulls the story along; so does the almost Capraesque hope that her absurd romantic prayer will come true.", "It's a small work, but nearly perfect."], "rating": ["", "3.5/5", "3/4", "3.5/4", "4/4", "", "", "", "4/5", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "", "", "3/5", "2.5/5", "4/4", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Kathy Fennessy", "Joe Bendel", "Scott Renshaw", "Peter Keough", "Michael Wilmington", "Kevin Thomas", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "David Sterritt", "David Parkinson", "", "James Berardinelli", "Geoff Andrew", "Emanuel Levy", "Vincent Canby", "Film4 Staff", "Philip Martin", "Michael W.
