On the fateful trip, they witness the attack on Pearl Harbor and are unable to help in their unarmed B-17 bomber. With the Japanese strike spurring the United States into World War II, the crew is reassigned to aid in the defense of the Philippines and endures constant attacks from enemy combatants.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h 4m", "director": "Howard Hawks", "studio": "WarnerBrothers/SevenArts", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 28, 2008", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["I cannot be sure how I feel about Air Force. It is loud, loose, sincere, violently masculine, and at times quite exciting.", "There isn't a literary line in Air Force; and there isn't a phony character.", "Air Force can't escape the shadow of its own jingoism. Its point wasn't just to inspire an American public but to make monsters of its enemies. It did so with chilling efficiency.", "A cheery bit of war propaganda that feels cringeworthy today, in which American soldiers seem extraordinarily giddy about the prospect of near-certain death, coupled with some terrible special-effects miniatures.", "The versatile Howard Hawks combines personal experience and knowing skills in directing this enjoyable WWII propaganda movie, which was nominated for four Oscars, winning one for editing.", "Gritty, emotional actioner made at height of WWII. Strong cast.", "All of director Howard Hawks' skills are on display in this exciting, crackerjack WWII film.", "For a propaganda film, this one is superior.", "Although it draws about the longest and most pliant bow that has ever been drawn in the line of fanciful war films and goes completely overboard in the last reel, it is still a continuously fascinating, frequently thrilling and occasionally exalting show.", "It isn't one of the director's most impressive outputs, but when a solid genre entry such as this is one of your \"lesser\" films, it says a lot about the quality of your work.", "Howard Hawks finds a perfect vehicle for his study of the male group. William Faulkner polished the dialogue, but as a silent it would still be tremendously exciting and evocative."], "rating": ["", "", "6/10", "3/5", "B+", "5/5", "", "B", "4/5", "6", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["James Agee", "Gilbert Seldes", "Nathanael Hood", "Christopher Lloyd", "Emanuel Levy", "Steve Crum", "Jeffrey M.
