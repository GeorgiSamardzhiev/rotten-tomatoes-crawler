Once again, Ripley must face skepticism and the alien as it hunts down the prisoners and guards. Without weapons or modern technology of any kind, Ripley leads the men into battle against the terrifying creature.", "rating": "44", "genre": "Horror/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "David Fincher", "studio": "TwentiethCenturyFox,BrandywineProductions", "theater_date": "May 22, 1992", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$54.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A bold tonal departure from its immediate predecessor, Alien 3 nevertheless weaves its nihilistic self under your skin and refuses to leave.", "Alien 3 really seems to miss the point of the first two films and what made them great.", "It's always visually breathtaking, and although the chases get a bit repetitive towards the end, Fincher infuses the material with a genuine sense of dread.", "Although it tries to resolutely conclude the series, the extreme lack of likable characters and the abundance of contrived events hinder its overall appeal.", "[Alien 3] is a vastly different experience than any other movie in the series, and that alone makes it a unique project worth celebrating.", "A pattern of studio interference and missteps prevented Alien from being all it could be, but the film is unfairly maligned and still manages to be an enjoyable, if flawed, outing.", "Unfortunately, David Fincher's \"Alien 3\" - though it's an honest attempt to sustain the creative level of the series - makes a good case for the idea of quitting while you're ahead.", "Dull and depressing, Alien3 has its moments, but they're few and far between. Not the worst movie ever made by any means, but also not a very exciting one to watch...", "A fascinating, frustrating mess of a movie where you spend just as much time trying to figure out what's happening on-screen as you do trying to figure out why you're trying to figure it out.", "Alien 3 has managed to sell out its violent space-fantasy concept to the intellectuals without satisfying them either.", "While its claustrophobic atmosphere and gathering feeling of dread initially generate a certain fascination, \"Alien3\" ultimately fails to build the sheer terror of Alien or the gutsy excitement of Aliens.", "Just at the point when Alien 3 should kick into high terror gear, it becomes clear that this hushed, somber sequel doesn't know how to deliver the goods.", "It suffers from poor supporting performances, and a plot that splutters instead of pushing on; but when the chase is on, all is forgiven.", "For all its inherent structural problems, Alien remains a worthy intended conclusion to the series, finding its true resolution in Ripley's resolve to break the endless cycle of her torment.", "The general perception was that, since [Fincher's] film was not Aliens, it was not any good. But it's an amazing film on many levels, switching 180 degrees to a grungy, dreary mood.", "It all happens - with equal confusion and intrigue - under the umbrella of a low-tech style so chilling in its presence that it becomes a character all on its own.", "A large step down from the original two films, the third is still entertaining and iconic.", "I recognize the film fandom fury that comes with such a drastic continuation, yet there's a big brown world of unusual cinematic risk here to consume. Alien 3 remains such a potent, mesmerizing force of doom.", "Too conceptually disjointed to live in the imagination after it's over, like its predecessors.", "It's a shame that Alien 3 nearly ruined the [Alien] franchise, but that doesn't make it a bad movie, just a bad sequel."], "rating": ["4/5", "6/10", "", "4/10", "", "3/5", "", "2/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "3/4", "3/4", "A-", "6/10", "8/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Trace Thurman", "Marianna Neal", "Peter Sobczynski", "Mike Massie", "Drew Dietsch", "Jim Ross", "David Baron", "David Hogan", "Zaki Hasan", "Vanessa Letts", "Malcolm Johnson", "David Ansen", "Anthony Lane", "Jake Cole", "Jeffrey M.
