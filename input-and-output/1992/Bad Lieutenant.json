{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The Lieutenant (Harvey Keitel) is a corrupt cop steeped in gambling debt who exploits his authority to sexually harass teenage girls, embezzle money and abuse drugs. His troubles come to a head when a mob lackey delivers an ultimatum: pay off his debt, or else. His fate appears sealed. But when The Lieutenant learns that a $50,000 reward is being offered to whoever catches a pair of thugs who raped a nun (Frankie Thorn), he jumps at the opportunity, hoping that he can still redeem himself.", "rating": "77", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Abel Ferrara", "studio": "BadLt.Productions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 1, 2016", "box_office": "$47.5K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Keitel's performance is courageous, almost psychotic, because it is deeply and profoundly authentic.", "Ferrara uses this fictional piece to penetrate the corrupt soul of a dirty rotten cop when he is confronted with something more terrible than even himself.", "[Keitel] keeps us watching his descent without wanting to look away. Only an actor with tremendous reserves of power could accomplish that.", "It's a powerhouse performance in a film of jabbing intensity and wit.", "The greatest New York City depiction of repentance in the deepest, darkest slums of the human soul since Scorsese's \"Mean Streets.\"", "As emptily defiant as a bit of graffiti on the base of a dustbin.", "Bad Lieutenant generates a fascination of abominations as Ferrara drives home his message about police corruption -- with Keitel's cop as the avatar of everything sick and evil in perverted law enforcement.", "It's a movie of wall-to-wall depravity and profound spiritual longing, at once one of the dirtiest and most deeply religious pictures I've ever seen.", "This is bull of a very high order.", "Alongside \"Reservoir Dogs\" Able Ferrara's 1992 tour-de-force crime drama provides the epic showcase for Harvey Keitel's impressive acting abilities.", "The combination of Keitel, New York City, and the Catholic Church reminds of Martin Scorsese's Mean Streets. Yet Bad Lieutenant is much more disturbing and in your face, and successfully portrays the destruction of the soul.", "Ferrara was in the right place at the right time to make Bad Lieutenant.", "Keitel's performance is perhaps the needed counterpoint to Christopher Walken's ice-cold overlord in Ferrara's visionary crime opus King of New York", "Members of the gutter-al elite will be the sole survivors.", "The work of a warped wizard.", "Keitel is onscreen for pretty much the entire movie and clearly relishes the opportunity of playing someone not so much teetering on the abyss as leaping off with a grand piano manacled to each ankle.", "Quite possibly Ferrara's finest hour, with an almost unbearably sincere performance from Keitel.", "Bad Lieutenant is finally a pulp parable of sin, addiction, and redemption, a movie that, like its subversive hero, revels in the pleasure -- and danger -- of going too far.", "Abel Ferrara's uncompromising Bad Lieutenant is a harrowing journey with a corrupt N.Y. cop sinking into the lower depths.", "Though hardly a film for all sensibilities, Bad Lieutenant has the courage of its own convictions, and follows them to the bitter end."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "4.5/5", "", "", "8/10", "", "", "", "", "A+", "3.5/5", "4/4", "4/5", "", "", "3/5", "4/5", "A-", "", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "C.H.
