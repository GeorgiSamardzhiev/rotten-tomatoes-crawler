{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Obsessed with violent movies and video technology, 14-year-old Benny (Arno Frisch) takes advantage of his parents' absence to have a girl (Ingrid Stassner) come over and watch a tape of a pig slaughter he has viewed repeatedly. Afterward, he kills her with the slaughtering gun used in the video -- and records the murder. His parents decide to cover up his crime. While his mother (Angela Winkler) takes a seemingly indifferent Benny to Egypt, his father (Ulrich M\u00fche) gets rid of the evidence.", "rating": "64", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Horror", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Michael Haneke", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 11, 2007", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The desensitising nature of popular culture is a theme that recurs throughout most of Michael Haneke's films, but rarely has it been more chillingly debated than in this almost nonchalant study of dysfunction and death.", "The second panel in Haneke's trilogy (preceded by Seventh Continent and followed by 71 Fragments) offers a chilling and haunting postmodern look at isolation, alienation and violence, with a critique of mass media effects on actual behavior.", "To Benny, and to us, too (at least for the duration of the film) the mediated image - blinkered, manipulable, vicarious - is the 'reality' of choice.", "[Makes] arguments that Haneke delivers with frosty menace but, alas, an also typically pedantic, haranguing tenor.", "Similar to The Seventh Continent, this film's objective is to analyze and deconstruct the effects rather than senselessly guess their causes", "An unsettling if not entirely successful social-cum-psychological drama.", "in the end, with a character that repellent and a message so heavy handed, there is no need to commit ourselves to this bitter, merciless film.", "What gives the film a chilly authenticity is the creepy performance of Arno Frisch in the title role.", "Pregnant with awful possibilities, this frightening, finger-pointing film feels less a provocation, more an attempt to eviscerate the medium from within.", "In some ways, the portrait of his parents is even more chilling.", "A smug, contemptuous, passive-aggressive attack on the dehumanizing effects of media."], "rating": ["4/5", "C+", "", "C", "3/4", "", "2/5", "", "", "", "1.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Parkinson", "Emanuel Levy", "Anton Bitel", "Nick Schager", "Derek Smith", "Geoff Andrew", "Keith Breese", "Stephen Holden", "Matt Glasby", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Eric Henderson"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Eye for Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lessons of Darkness", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinematic Reflections", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmcritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slant Magazine"], "date": ["February 6, 2015", "July 21, 2009", "February 26, 2008", "April 18, 2007", "August 19, 2006", "June 24, 2006", "June 6, 2006", "May 6, 2006", "May 6, 2006", "May 6, 2006", "May 3, 2006"]}}
