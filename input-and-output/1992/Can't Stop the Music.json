{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this fictional account of the Village People, fashion model Samantha Simpson (Valerie Perrine) helps her roommate, Jack Morrell (Steve Guttenberg), try to get a record deal. Morrell's demo isn't perfect, so Simpson searches New York for a proper group to sing the songs and finds a group made up of a police officer, a cowboy, a construction worker, a soldier, an Indian and a biker. They are primed for success, but complications arise when advertisers grow wary of their image.", "rating": "7", "genre": "Cult Movies/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 58m", "director": "Nancy Walker", "studio": "EMIFilmsLtd.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 1, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Pretty poor, but the enjoyable level of kitsch places it above the other musical turkeys of the era, all of which are far more painful to endure (Sgt.
