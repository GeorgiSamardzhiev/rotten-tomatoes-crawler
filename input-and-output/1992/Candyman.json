{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Skeptical graduate student Helen Lyle (Virginia Madsen) befriends Anne-Marie McCoy (Vanessa Williams) while researching superstitions in a housing project on Chicago's Near North Side. From Anne-Marie, Helen learns about the Candyman (Tony Todd), a knife-wielding figure of urban legend that some of her neighbors believe to be responsible for a recent murder. After a mysterious man matching the Candyman's description begins stalking her, Helen comes to fear that the legend may be all too real.", "rating": "76", "genre": "Horror", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Bernard Rose", "studio": "PropagandaFilms,PolyGramFilmedEntertainment", "theater_date": "Oct 16, 1992", "dvd_date": "Nov 27, 2013", "box_office": "$23.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Wonderfully playing against expectation, Candyman leaves you wondering where the story will go next, something missing in most horror movies.", "...the Tony Todd-starring classic from 1992 was something else.", "If the movie has a White lens, it at least makes room for a Black side-eye.", "The premise is highly original, the atmosphere terrifying, and the acting superb, especially considering the subgenre and its popularity for poor performances.", "Candyman is creepy without relying heavily on the elements that have always turned me away from horror... building a sense of foreboding atmosphere with the help of an incredibly chilling score by Phillip Glass.", "The drama in its story is put before its horror ingredients, making it one of the best films around. It's a psychological horror film with captivating social commentary.", "The movie soon enough abandons this interesting and original direction, detouring back onto familiar horror movie ground.", "While Candyman has a standard ration of supernatural powers, the movie's effects are tame. Nor does Rose exhibit any sense of humor.", "This is primal mythic territory. And the movie has more than its share of junky frights. It's loaded with things that go bump in the night.", "Madsen is absolutely terrific, giving a thoughtful and well-shaded performance as the emotionally abandoned heroine, and Rose's bold direction milks every terrifying moment of this compelling and atmospheric movie.", "If Candyman doesn't live up to its potential, it does fulfill most of the Saturday night requirements. The action is swift, if excessively graphic, and Madsen proves a strong-willed, sympathetic lead.", "[Helen's] loneliness would almost be pitiful if the film didn't unconsciously juxtapose it against the needs of Candyman himself. And that's exactly the point.", "This Candyman can elicit some bona fide shivers while the picture that bears his name is high-caliber horror in its purest, most primal form.", "To pull it off would take the utmost artistry and imagination, but writer-director Bernard Rose expends his energy mainly on the easier task of churning up violence and gore for its own sake.", "Lots of gory moments in '90s \"urban legend\" slasher film.", "Candyman has an interesting premise. It just works under its atypical treatment of cliches. But a good movie? I don't think so. [Full review in Spanish].", "Bernard Rose's Candyman offers a moody \"elegance\", if you will, that's sorely lacking in other horror films of the era.", "An urban horror allegory about the white guilt people feel standing on the outside looking in, encountering worse horrors after invading places where they just don't belong.", "Give Candyman hosannas for offering an intriguing premise, but then give it hell for not following through on its initial promise.", "Candyman stands up to the test of time and it feels even more prescient today. It had the guts the explore race relations within the context of horror without resorting to stereotypes or moralizing while still remaining scary and engaging."], "rating": ["", "", "3/4", "9/10", "", "A+", "2/4", "", "3.5/4", "4/5", "3/4", "", "", "", "3/5", "2.5/4", "7/10", "4.5/5", "2/4", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Monica Castillo", "Dan Buffa", "Josh Larsen", "Mike Massie", "Petrana Radulovic", "Preston Barta", "Stephen Hunter", "People Staff", "Jeff Simon", "Alan Jones", "Dave Kehr", "Matt Cipolla", "Michael Rechtshaffen", "Kevin Thomas", "Brian Costello", "Federico Furzan", "Imran Khan", "C.H.
