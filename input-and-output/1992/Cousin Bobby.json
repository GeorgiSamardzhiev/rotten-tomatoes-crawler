{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Robert Castle is the idealistic pastor of St. Mary's Episcopal Church in Harlem, and also the cousin of filmmaker Jonathan Demme. Demme's affectionate portrait of his cousin traces Castle's story, beginning with his first parish assignment, in New Jersey in the early 1960s, in an increasingly African-American-populated neighborhood rocked by violence and civil rights protests. The film raises intimate discussions of race, faith and family, while also showing Castle's daily routine as a pastor.", "rating": "", "genre": "Documentary/Drama/Special Interest/Faith & Spirituality", "runtime": "1h 10m", "director": "Jonathan Demme", "studio": "TesauroS.A.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["What keeps Cousin Bobby tense is the tug of war between style and disorder; it keeps drifting into asides and anecdotes, then suddenly pulling itself together.", "", "", "It is good to know there are people like Cousin Bobby around.
