What Kent doesn't know is that Dimsdale knows legendary lawman Tom Destry, who in turns sends his daring son Tom Destry Jr. (James Stewart) to Bottleneck to save the day.", "rating": "96", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Western", "runtime": "1h 34m", "director": "George Marshall", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["I never thought I'd last to hear Dietrich shouting, 'Yippee.\"", "[James Stewart] cuts quite the striking figure as the lanky, against-the-odds gunman.
