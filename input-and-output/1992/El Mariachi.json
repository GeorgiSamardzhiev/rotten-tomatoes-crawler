{"metadata": {"synopsis": "El Mariachi (Carlos Gallardo) is a traveling guitar player with the modest desire to play music for a living. Looking for a job, he stops at a bar in a tiny town, where his simple, peaceful lifestyle is interrupted. Local hit men, expecting enemy assassin Azul (Reinol Martinez) to invade their town, believe that the visiting musician is the professional killer they are looking for. Unwittingly embroiled in vicious mob warfare, El Mariachi must shoot his way out of town if he is to survive.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 22m", "director": "Robert Rodriguez", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation,LosHooligansProductions", "theater_date": "Feb 26, 1993", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$1.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Famously shot for around $7000...", "With kinetic camera work and dynamic editing, Rodriguez constructs action sequences that leave a lot of big-budget movies in the dust. Besides, the movie's history has become part of its charm.", "Despite its age, El Mariachi holds up remarkably well. The film's low budget (roughly $7,000, allegedly) actually helps build tension in the narrative - like you're watching something that's really happening.", "Has a verve and cheekiness that's partly a smart wedding of such influences as Sergio Leone, George Miller and south-of-the-border noir.", "The unrelenting tempo is bolstered by Rodriguez's camera work and editing: nearly every frame seems to have been shot with a careening, handheld camera, and they're cut together in a skillful, fluid fashion that enhances the tension and pace.", "Juicy, adroit, and likable.", "No festival is true to its name if it doesn't display at least one discovery. In 1992 that spot was occupied by Robert Rodriguez, who made a charming actioner for $7,500; never mind that Columbia later invested $1 million for its theatrical release.", "Rodriguez goes for broke with a breakneck pace, swarms of bullets, cinematic tricks, and a tone as playful as it is knowing of genre conventions. The director's light touch is all his own; and this unpretentious offering delivers in all departments.", "", "An endlessly inventive and charming zero-budget action movie.", "Brilliant low-budget filmmaking. Better than most action films with ten times the budget.", "Nowhere near as extravagant as its succesors, yet it remains a constant simple pleasure, best enjoyed with a shot of Patron and a cold Corona", "Inspiring but misses a few cylinders", "A silly adventure tale that would have failed even with a $200 million budget.", "Has tons more charm than its star-studded, big-budget reprise, Desperado.", "", "It goes without saying that Mr. Rodriguez, having made such a clever and inventive debut, is prepared for a big future of his own.", "", "", "Arguably the most amazing film made in 1990s."], "rating": ["2.5/4", "", "8/10", "", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "", "3/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "2/5", "C-", "3/4", "3/5", "4/5", "3/5", "4/5", "7/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Nusair", "Brian D.
