It's one thing to make each film similar, it's another to give them amnesia.", "Following the second outing, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is able to re-capture the magic that made us fall in love with Indiana Jones.", "For a film that clearly sets out to make Indiana Jones his own legend, it does so in every sense of the word.", "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade is the most wonderful lark. It is also a class act.", "It has a grand scope and epic scale, still, but we're left with a larger idea of the man wearing the fedora.", "Take a good look at this movie. In fact, go back four or five times and take four or five good looks. In this imperfect world, you're not likely to see many manmade objects come this close to perfection.", "Not surprisingly, Ford has most of the action here. But Connery -- in what is often a test of a true actor -- shows how much you can do with an essentially passive part.", "What we want from Spielberg and Lucas is plenty of action, and plenty of laughs. And that's just what they deliver.", "Fans of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas' Indiana Jones series may rest assured that the latest installment, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, is fully up to, as well as virtually indistinguishable from, its predecessors.", "As usual, the action is on an epic scale and delivered with breathless enthusiasm and much panache by director Steven Spielberg.", "The Last Crusade is a step backward for [Spielberg], but backwardness is an integral part of the Indy series right from its kiddie-matinee origins.", "Though Last Crusade lacks the novelty of Raiders (and, by the way, the flat-out breathless pacing of Temple of Doom), it's an entertaining capper to the trilogy.", "This is not so much a bad film as a machine-like one lacking the same energy as the original, which it most resembles.", "Even if he's considerably more battered than his nearest competitor, Indiana quits at the top of the heap. It's just that the heap isn't what it was eight years ago. It's been almost flattered to death.", "benign slapstick.", "Thrilling third Indy actioner focuses on hunt for grail.", "Last Crusade is pure kicks, and I would never fault this spunky blast of quips and near-misses for trying to vanilla its way back into the hearts of millions.", "It shows us Indy's origin and even ends with him riding off into the sunset after completing the ultimate quest of finding the Holy Grail.
