{"metadata": {"synopsis": "On the outskirts of town, the hard-nosed Vienna (Joan Crawford) owns a saloon frequented by the undesirables of the region, including Dancin' Kid (Scott Brady) and his gang. Another patron of Vienna's establishment is Johnny Guitar (Sterling Hayden), a former gunslinger and her lover. When a heist is pulled in town that results in a man's death, Emma Small (Mercedes McCambridge), Vienna's rival, rallies the townsfolk to take revenge on Vienna's saloon -- even without proof of her wrongdoing.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts/Western", "runtime": "1h 50m", "director": "Nicholas Ray", "studio": "RepublicPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 6, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Johnny Guitar is not really a Western, nor is it an 'intellectual Western'. It is a Western that is dream-like, magical, unreal to a degree, delirious.", "While I won't say that I loved the film (it retains enough of its genre's tropes to not quite work for me), I was surprised by how glorious the sets and landscapes looked.", "Double-crosses, beautiful losers, gunplay and waterfalls and fire and whiskey, it's all here.", "Mildred Pierce unleashed on the wild, wild West.", "A cheap Western from Republic Pictures, yes. And also one of the boldest and most stylized films of its time, quirky, political, twisted.", "This baroque bonanza fascinates on so many levels that it demands to be repeatedly viewed and reviewed.", "Compared to other Westerns, Johnny Guitar is high art--richly atmospheric and with noir elements that will remind viewers of such dramatic films as Key Largo.", "Joan Crawford's Vienna is the most masculine of women western heroes. A former saloon girl who earned her way to owning her own gambling house, she's a mature woman with a history and she's not ashamed of what she did to carve out her claim for a future.", "Not too many westerns culminate in a six-gun showdown between two women -- but then Nicholas Ray wasn't your average filmmaker.", "When Crawford pulls a gun, her authority is so complete that she doesn't even come across as a woman in male drag; she owns it on her own terms.", "Feminism, Freud and firearms all figure in this exemplary yarn that also takes aim at the blacklisting that was tearing apart the film industry.", "Unforgettably strange and brilliant.", "A movie for anyone who's ever been judged on their appearance, their outlook or the way they choose to live.", "Nicholas Ray's overwhelming ballad", "It's not just Joan's campiness -- her line readings take on an almost incantatory quality -- but the way the whole thing feels like a stealth therapy session for smart actors trapped in horse-opera stereotypes.", "A slyly radical psychosexual oddity busting through genre conventions, beyond its Old West Arizona setting ...", "The acidulous palette of the costumes and the dcor conjure Ray's insolent, isolated fury; though the action is set in the nineteenth century, the actors break out of the story to foreshadow the stylishly electric revolutions to come.", "It's a film that's many things to many people, from camp spectacular to revisionist genre epic, and nearly every reading seems viable.", "This Technicolor cowboy picture feels like it exists in some other dimension. \"Johnny Guitar\" satirizes macho posturing, even as it elevates the catfight to a whole new level.", "One of Nicholas Ray's best films, the garish, full-color Freudian Western is an amazing, weird movie that's not easy to get the first time around."], "rating": ["", "", "", "3.5/4", "4/4", "4/5", "B+", "", "4/5", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "5/5", "5/5", "", "5/5", "", "", "4/4", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Francois Truffaut", "Tara Judah", "Eve Tushnet", "Josh Larsen", "Roger Ebert", "David Parkinson", "James Plath", "Sean Axmaker", "Stephen Kelly", "James Kendrick", "Matt Brunson", "Peter Bradshaw", "Tom Huddleston", "Fernando F.
