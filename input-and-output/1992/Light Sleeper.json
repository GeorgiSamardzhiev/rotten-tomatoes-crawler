Complicating John's life further is a series of drug-related murders that has the police pegging him as a suspect.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Paul Schrader", "studio": "GrainofSandProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 3, 2016", "box_office": "$1.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The plot and characterization came across as an adolescent fantasy which had entirely missed its mark.", "A resonant thriller.", "The movie is smart and sassy and alluring. It's like a gifted impressionist updating his material with wit and brio and respect.", "Light Sleeper is emblematic of an era, and is recommended on that basis and on the excellent quality of it acting.", "It's a failure perhaps, but an honorable failure. If it isn't saved by grace, it has many saving graces.", "With his deliberate speech patterns and haunted, reptilian good looks, Dafoe is an almost nobly sad presence at the center of the film. There's something wonderfully calm about his performance, and it holds Light Sleeper together.", "Dafoe completely inhabits the character, appearing in virtually every scene and developing a fascinating psychological profile.", "For all of Schrader's capacity for spectacular self-laceration and spiritual agony, Light Sleeper finds him able for the first time to express a certain peacefulness, and the effect is delicate and discreet.", "Crowd pleasing? No. Challenging? You bet.", "It`s a pretty good little movie, not so insignificantly for the performance of Willem Dafoe as the drug delivery man with a desire for a different life.", "While Dafoe has made a career of looking wasted, and does cynicism better than anyone around, he too is handicapped by his unsympathetic character and Schrader's clumsily unidiomatic script.", "Susan Sarandon is so good as Dafoe's boss, and the dialogue is so literate for such a familiar story, that there's a lot to admire -- it's Schrader's best film -- as long as one can get past the transcendental claptrap.", "Too often, however, the movie is undone by mood-spoiling flaws, among them a gratingly bad rock song that keeps popping up.", "Willem Dafoe's performance as LeTour is the glue that holds the film together, and it's a remarkable one.", "Light Sleeper remains a superior picture from one of America's more stimulating filmmakers.", "[A] leisurely paced but ultimately rewarding study of terminal addiction in all its many forms.", "The movie is a small but absorbing mood piece, a canny insider's view of the life of a Manhattan drug dealer.", "A superb Dafoe contributes crucially to the degree of success the film achieves.", "It does develop powerfully the themes of Schrader's earlier work and will not disappoint his fans.", "Schrader certainly has his finger on the pulse of the times, and the universally strong performances do ample justice to his sensitive ear for dialogue."], "rating": ["", "B+", "2.5/4", "3/4", "", "3/4", "3/4", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "2/4", "3.5/4", "", "3/5", "B", "", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Vanessa Letts", "Dennis Schwartz", "Stephen Hunter", "Gene Siskel", "Michael Wilmington", "Steven Rea", "Jeff Shannon", "Dave Kehr", "Peter Travers", "Candice Russell", "Ralph Novak", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Gary Thompson", "", "Richard Luck", "Alan Jones", "Owen Gleiberman", "Variety Staff", "Kim Newman", "Geoff Andrew"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rolling Stone", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out"], "date": ["July 24, 2018", "November 5, 2014", "September 10, 2014", "September 9, 2014", "September 9, 2014", "September 9, 2014", "September 9, 2014", "September 9, 2014", "September 9, 2014", "September 9, 2014", "September 9, 2014", "September 9, 2014", "September 9, 2014", "September 9, 2014", "September 9, 2014", "September 9, 2014", "September 7, 2011", "March 26, 2009", "February 4, 2009", "February 9, 2006"]}}
