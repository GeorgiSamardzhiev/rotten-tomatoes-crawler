{"metadata": {"synopsis": "New York lawyer Vinny has never won a case. When his teenage cousin Bill and his friend Stan are accused of murder in a backwater Alabama town, it's up to the nervous Vinny to save him from jail, even though he's only ever tried personal injury cases before, and none of them successfully.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "Jonathan Lynn", "studio": "TwentiethCenturyFox", "theater_date": "Mar 13, 1992", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$50.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["While it certainly does feed into some stereotypes, it seems to do so with a certain amount of affection.", "Thanks to director Lynn's own legal expertise, a level of authenticity amusingly lingers amidst the drama, clever personas, alluring storyline, and convivial performances.", "In My Cousin Vinny, a careless miscarriage of justice serves as the premise for a courtroom comedy that is funnier than it has any right to be.", "My Cousin Vinny proves that well-written and superbly delivered jokes belong in comedies.", "My Cousin Vinny slumps badly as the courtroom scenes drag on; but when Tomei is on screen, even the jury wakes up.", "Vinny is a winning character and Pesci's performance as the beleaguered litigant is terrific - cranked yet cuddly.", "The undercurrent of fish-out-of-water silliness goes a long way towards perpetuating the affable atmosphere...", "With such canny scene-stealers as Gwynne, Smith, Pendleton, McGill and Chaykin filling out the cast, it is very hard for My Cousin Vinny to go wrong, and indeed, for the purpose of pleasant Saturday night entertainment, it does not.", "Marisa Tomei, as Vinny's fiance, imbues the most obligatory reactions with either a startling ferocity or a farcical ambiguity worthy of her character's name: Mona Lisa Vito.", "The movie sags as Vinny sets out to demolish the patently shaky case and dubious witnesses for the prosecution. Pesci does his best, but a lawyer's suit on him becomes a straitjacket.", "As Vincent Gambini, a swaggering pint-sized New York lawyer who only recently passed the bar on his sixth try, Pesci modulates his usual psycho-nuttiness and gives it some recognizably human, even melancholy, undertones.", "Nothing makes a moviegoer feel more isolated than sitting stony-faced through a comedy that makes the rest of the audience laugh and cheer.", "The pacing is brisk and the energy of the performances is so palpable that even at its silliest and most contrived, the film is enjoyable.", "My Cousin Vinny is a hoot.", "The regional stereotypes in Dale Launer's broad script aren't so laudable, but the on-screen talent merits a retrial: Tomei talks up a storm and Pesci terrorises thinly spread gags into near-shape.", "For all of its grossly stereotypical characterizations and cheap laughs, My Cousin Vinny does benefit from Pesci's characteristically energetic performance. And co-star Tomei looks very nice in a clinging blue dress with gold lame applique.", "I don't want to oversell My Cousin Vinny. It's hardly brilliant. But it's easygoing and occasionally quite funny and ultimately satisfying.", "[An] enjoyable fish-out-of-water comedy.", "The screenplay by Dale Launer has all the sophomoric qualities of a C- grade TV movie.", "Joe Pesci has more energy than charm in the title role, but the supporting cast has some terrific moments, and the comedy supplies a fair number of laughs before running completely out of steam."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "9/10", "", "4/5", "", "", "3/4", "3/4", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "3/4", "", "3/5", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "4/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Mike Massie", "Brian D.
