{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this musical, homeless New York City newsboy Jack \"Cowboy\" Kelly (Christian Bale) befriends two newcomers to his trade, brothers David (David Moscow) and Les Jacobs (Luke Edwards). When publisher Joseph Pulitzer (Robert Duvall) sets new rules that make it harder for the young newspaper salesmen to make a buck, the boys go on strike. Bryan Denton (Bill Pullman), a journalist who's sympathetic to their plight, gives them some tips in public relations, as the newsboys' battle grips the city.", "rating": "39", "genre": "Kids & Family/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "2h 1m", "director": "Kenny Ortega", "studio": "WaltDisneyPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 23, 2015", "box_office": "$2.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["With Little Old New York re-created by William Sandfell, Newsies often looks wonderful, and Bale and the boys give it heart and excitement. Yet as a musical, Newsies rarely hits home.", "It's extremely earnest and more than a little corny, but there's an innocence about it that makes it kinda irresistible.", "...manages some acrobatic dance numbers, but they seem oddly confined by the camera's frame.", "Certain movies engage your affections so strongly that, even if they start to fall apart, you tend to keep rooting for them. That's pretty much the case with Newsies.", "A Disney musical with an undistinguished score, fair to middling choreography, and clunky direction that still manages to be entertaining in spots because of its story.", "Bale and Menken are literally what make the movie sing.", "Despite Newsies' many flaws, it's bracing to see Disney attempt a PG movie about something as meaty as labor relations. Would that every strike be resolved with so little bloodshed and so many songs.", "Newsies is a live-action musical, but it's only barely alive. Call it Snoozies.", "There`s a boyish exuberance about Newsies that is hard to resist.", "Stop the presses! Newsies is the best live-action movie musical since Little Shop of Horrors.", "An old-fashioned musical that is better when its characters sing and dance than when they talk.", "Though the cast is large, no interesting or even moderately well-rounded personalities emerge from it, and no compelling relationships emerge between the characters.", "Bale and the cast are energetic and fun to watch, and the story itself is fascinating history. But the songs and choreography are a disappointment.", "As a drama, it features potent material. But by presenting this as a musical, all hope is lost, thanks to imminently forgettable tunes and the casting of actors who can't sing.", "The movie stands as a textbook demonstration of why they don't -- and probably shouldn't -- make 'em like they used to.", "Kids go on strike in gritty, historical musical.", "Making his directorial bow, choreographer Kenny Ortega strains valiantly to breathe life into this misguided musical.", "The writers have created cardboard cutouts instead of flesh-and-blood characters.", "It's a bit of a throwback and a solid family film and, at the time, represented a well-intentioned leap of faith of the sort that studios rarely take.", "If you have a soft spot for feisty, back-talking bambini with cute squints, backwards caps and names like Crutchy, Dutchy and Bumlets, your heart will melt."], "rating": ["", "2.5/4", "1/4", "2.5/5", "", "3.5/4", "2.5/4", "2/4", "", "4/5", "3/4", "2/4", "6/10", "2/4", "C", "3/5", "2/4", "", "3/4", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Malcolm Johnson", "Christy Lemire", "Josh Larsen", "Michael Wilmington", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "John Hartl", "Carrie Rickey", "Stephen Hunter", "Candice Russell", "Jay Boyar", "Gene Siskel", "Dave Kehr", "James Plath", "Matt Brunson", "Owen Gleiberman", "Charles Cassady", "", "Variety Staff", "James Berardinelli", "Joshua Rothkopf"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ChristyLemire.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Metropolis", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ReelViews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out"], "date": ["June 4, 2018", "March 19, 2018", "January 24, 2016", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "June 24, 2012", "June 19, 2012", "September 7, 2011", "December 15, 2010", "March 9, 2009", "December 11, 2008", "June 10, 2008", "January 26, 2006"]}}
