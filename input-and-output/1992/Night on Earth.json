In Los Angeles, no-nonsense taxi driver Corky (Winona Ryder) gets an engaging customer in the form of a Hollywood casting agent (Gena Rowlands), while a Parisian cabbie (Isaach De Bankol\u00e9) must contend with some rowdy African diplomats. Among the other tales, a standout is the Italian taxi ride that finds quirky driver Gino (Roberto Benigni) making a lively confession to an ailing priest.", "rating": "75", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 8m", "director": "Jim Jarmusch", "studio": "PandoraCinema", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 22, 2017", "box_office": "$2.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["As expected, the quality of the individual vignettes varies, though only one is an out-and-out drag.", "Funny, penetrating, zany and sad film.", "Throughout, Jim Jarmusch playfully blurs the line between driver/passenger, servant/customer, and native/immigrant.", "Takes us to places most other filmmakers never do.", "Jarmusch's most accessible exercise to date while also his least seen", "Revisiting his interest in oblique comedy, Jarmusch explores a primal relationship, that of a passenger and taxi driver, using the cab as a temporary shared world, from which one party may emerge shaken up or feeling differently about himself/herself", "Though it may take a while to get Jarmusch's gist, hang in there; by the time Tom Waits growls his lovely closing waltz over the credits, Jarmusch has shown us moments most filmmakers don't even notice.", "Almost good, but not quite there.", "", "Beautiful color cityscapes", "", "", "A clever glimpse of the human condition via taxi drivers and their passengers in five different cities", "With this, his fourth commercially released feature, Mr. Jarmusch again demonstrates his mastery of comedy of the oblique.", "", "Flawed by fascinating", "", "\"Night on Earth\" sounds better than it turns out to be.", "Jarmusch's movies aren't for everyone - but for the sophisticated audience he pursues there are sometimes great rewards.", ""], "rating": ["3/4", "", "", "B+", "3.5/5", "C+", "", "2/5", "3/5", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5", "", "3.5/5", "3/5", "4/5", "2/5", "", "3/4", "0"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Matt Brunson", "Malcolm Johnson", "Derek Smith", "Dennis Schwartz", "Chris Cabin", "Emanuel Levy", "Geoff Andrew", "Cole Smithey", "Jules Brenner", "Michael E.
