{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Following a series of drug deals and murders, three criminals -- Fantasia (Cynda Williams), Ray Malcolm (Billy Bob Thornton) and Pluto (Michael Beach) -- travel from Los Angeles to Houston, finally arriving in a small Arkansas town to go into hiding. Two detectives from the LAPD, who are already on the case, contact the town's sheriff, Dale Dixon (Bill Paxton), to alert him of the fugitives' presence in the area. Underestimating Dixon, the criminals have no idea what they are about to face.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Carl Franklin", "studio": "IRSMedia", "theater_date": "May 8, 1992", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$44.5K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One False Move is a very satisfying discovery, for it is a film of vicious force and emotional depth that has no flaw worth mentioning.", "The overall journey is slow and in great need of editing or reworking to create keener emphasis on the motives that lead to specific choices and confrontations.", "Even worse than this annoying contrivance is Fantasia's portentous speech about the cry of a whippoorwill. And, yes, we actually do hear a whippoorwill cry. Perhaps it's a sign of the death of the hopes the promising film gives rise to, but then betrays.", "The film is not quite the masterpiece some have hailed, but it has a bluesy grip, subtle humour and more thought than the average thriller.", "Franklin seizes the opportunity to make a film that tightly binds up any political concerns it may have into the plot.", "Clark Franklin's One False Move brings a shotgun to a knife fight, and the results aren't pretty.", "Franklin no alecciona, muestra, a modo de thriller, las terribles consecuencias de la incursin de la violencia en la diaria tranquilidad de un pueblo en el que nunca pasa nada.", "Franklin's convincing portrait of life on both sides of the color line isn't quite like anything I've come across before, making One False Move one very assured directorial move. We need more filmmakers like him.", "In this film ably directed by Carl Franklin, who has spent most of his adulthood as an actor, there are more than a few tense scenes.", "For most of the way, One False Move is taut and sure-footed.", "Skillfully performed and welcomely unpredictable, this low-budget crime film, made by actor turned director Carl Franklin, starts out as a herky-jerky exploitation piece, then turns into something better.", "Everything about this movie -- the terse writing, the concise directing, the smart, unaffected acting -- is eminently satisfying.", "Rookie director Carl Franklin shows an obvious gift for pace and storytelling -- uncertain, halting moments are rare. Almost every scene has rich and authentic feeling.", "One False Move doesn't make a single false move its own self: It's as tough and gripping as they come.", "The biggest difference between One False Move and most other action films is the sting in its violence. There is so little stylization here -- so little gimmickry -- that when someone is shot or knifed, you feel it.", "It exerts an almost macabre fascination as we track the killers bloody trail across several states to their inevitable deaths.", "Emotionally complex thriller with riveting performances.", "The story is punctuated by violence that's as pointless as it is nasty, though, showing an unfortunate immaturity in the filmmakers.", "Mixing moments of genuine terror with offbeat comedy, writers Tom Epperson and Thornton have created a script that jumps along with the energy of In Cold Blood.", "There's plenty to be impressed by while watching this 1992 noirish thriller, cowritten by Tom Epperson and directed by Carl Franklin, but not a great deal of aftertaste."], "rating": ["4/5", "5/10", "", "", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "3.5/5", "", "3.5/4", "4/4", "3.5/4", "4/4", "", "4/5", "", "4/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jack Hawkins", "Mike Massie", "Owen McNally", "Quentin Curtis", "Adam Mars-Jones", "Glenn Heath Jr.", "Alberto Abu\u00edn", "Michael Upchurch", "Candice Russell", "Peter Rainer", "Michael Sragow", "Steven Rea", "Gary Thompson", "Stephen Hunter", "Jay Boyar", "", "Mark Salisbury", "David Sterritt", "Gene Siskel", "Jonathan Rosenbaum"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">HeyUGuys", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent on Sunday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slant Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader"], "date": ["January 18, 2021", "September 21, 2020", "April 23, 2018", "December 12, 2017", "November 16, 2017", "May 6, 2017", "March 3, 2017", "May 6, 2013", "May 6, 2013", "May 6, 2013", "May 6, 2013", "May 6, 2013", "May 6, 2013", "May 6, 2013", "May 6, 2013", "May 6, 2013", "May 6, 2013", "May 6, 2013", "May 6, 2013", "May 6, 2013"]}}
