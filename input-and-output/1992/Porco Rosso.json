{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In Italy in the 1930s, sky pirates in biplanes terrorize wealthy cruise ships as they sail the Adriatic Sea. The only pilot brave enough to stop the scourge is the mysterious Porco Rosso (Shuichiro Moriyama), a former World War I flying ace who was somehow turned into a pig during the war. As he prepares to battle the pirate crew's American ace, Porco Rosso enlists the help of spunky girl mechanic Fio Piccolo (Akemi Okamura) and his longtime friend Madame Gina (Tokiko Kato).", "rating": "95", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Animation/Anime & Manga/Art House & International/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Hayao Miyazaki", "studio": "StudioGhibli,TokumaShoten", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 17, 2019", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A plot that never bores, that keeps the viewer completely hooked and that is the perfect tool to show a SPECTACULAR direction.
