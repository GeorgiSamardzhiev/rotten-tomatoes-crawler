{"metadata": {"synopsis": "One of the biggest stars in country music, Dusty Wyatt Chandler (George Strait) grows disillusioned with the hollow performances and overly produced arena shows he's contractually obligated to play. In an effort to become grounded, Chandler walks away from the spotlight and goes back to the country town of his youth. After finding work at a ranch, he falls for the owner's daughter, Lula Rogers (Lesley Ann Warren). However, his manager (Isabel Glasser) is determined to keep the show going.", "rating": "41", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts/Romance", "runtime": "1h 52m", "director": "Christopher Cain", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 1, 2008", "box_office": "$12.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["As directed by Christopher Cain, Strait's first feature will probably not go down as a classic contemporary western nor a great modern musical. But it lopes along pleasantly, and Strait effortlessly makes the crossover into acting.", "If it were any cornier or mushier, it would be chowder, but this vehicle for country singer Strait generates a charming sweetness, the music is lively, and both Strait and Glasser are ingratiating new faces.", "This is an enjoyable movie for fans of country music, for whom the rich soundtrack should be a delight. And if they happen to have a crush on George Strait, so much the better.", "Strait gives an uncertain performance, full of blatantly rehearsed reactions and stoic delivery. It looks like he's reluctant to participate, and you can hardly blame him.", "You always know that you're being manipulated by Pure Country, and you're usually pretty sure what's going to happen next. Still, chances are fairly good you'll leave the theater smiling when it's over, humming one of the sentimental songs.", "The director, Christopher Cain, brings not a hint of irony to any of this -- not even to the Vegas finale in which Dusty is supposed to rescue himself from glitz.", "Pure Country is an Elvis movie with a thick country twang.", "If Strait weren't so appealing, the movie would be easier to dismiss. Let's hope it does well enough to give him a second shot and that maybe he can find something a little bit less Vegas and a little bit more East Texas.", "Your opinion of this tale of a troubled country superstar will depend totally on your reaction to George Strait. There's no denying he's handy with a tune, but dialogue proves more difficult for him.", "Pure twaddle.", "Singers often make good actors, but Strait's debut performance doesn't measure up to his heartfelt, down-home warbling. It doesn't matter much: Pure Country is pure corn.", "Pure Country doesn't have much real drama in it because it`s only a flip of the coin as to how the story is going to turn out. But Strait and newcomer Glasser make solid impressions.", "Country superstar George Strait is so laid-back he barely registers onscreen in Pure Country, an unabashedly corny by-the-numbers drama.", "The romantic subplot between Strait and Glasser's respective characters goes a long way towards perpetuating the movie's affable atmosphere...", "Though this slick-looking paean to down-home values often undercuts its own message, Pure Country is an effective vehicle for amiable country star George Strait.", "", "", "Too much of it depends on the magnetism of Mr. Strait, who peers into the camera sheepishly and never seems the superstar he is supposed to be.", "Country music superstar George Strait makes his acting debut in an extended music video held together by a formulaic plot that harkens back to the Golden Age of Hollywood.", "This is the very definition of the kind of movie where fans of the star will enjoy it more than dispassionate observers."], "rating": ["", "", "2.5/4", "2/4", "2.5/4", "1.5/4", "1.5/4", "2/4", "2/5", "1/4", "", "", "2/5", "3/4", "", "2/5", "2/5", "", "2/5", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Malcolm Johnson", "Ralph Novak", "Elizabeth Lynch", "Gary Thompson", "John Wooley", "John Hartl", "Steven Rea", "Stephen Hunter", "David Parkinson", "Clifford Terry", "Peter Rainer", "Gene Siskel", "", "David Nusair", "Joseph McBride", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "Emanuel Levy", "Janet Maslin", "Pamela Bruce", "Roger Ebert"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fantastica Daily", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Austin Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Sun-Times"], "date": ["June 4, 2018", "May 18, 2016", "May 18, 2016", "May 18, 2016", "May 18, 2016", "May 18, 2016", "May 18, 2016", "May 18, 2016", "May 18, 2016", "May 18, 2016", "May 18, 2016", "May 18, 2016", "May 18, 2016", "February 19, 2011", "March 26, 2009", "October 9, 2005", "September 9, 2005", "May 20, 2003", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000"]}}
