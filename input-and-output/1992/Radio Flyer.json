Soon after, she remarries a man (Adam Baldwin) who insists on being called \"the King\" and who beats young Bobby when Mary isn't around. The boys try to escape their harsh home life through fantasy, most of it centered on their Radio Flyer wagon.

They remain locked into the odd combination of the dreamy and the dreadful that is entirely of their own devising.", "What you get in Radio Flyer is an unholy brew of whimsy and blasphemy. It flits from the unwatchable to the unbelievable, with nary a pause between them and the effect, to say the least, is unsettling.", "A very odd, expensive, ambitious failure that tries hard to achieve the Spielberg touch but succeeds only in reminding you of how few filmmakers can successfully lay claim to his territory.", "Radio Flyer is a well-meaning failure, a muddled fantasy about child abuse that ponderously attempts to combine the grace of legend with the earnestness of a public-service announcement.", "A movie is not a public-service announcement, and a movie that tries to squeak by on intentions doesn't generally doesn't get very far.
