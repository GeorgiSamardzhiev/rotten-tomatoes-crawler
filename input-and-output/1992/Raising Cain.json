{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A highly regarded child psychologist, Dr. Carter Nix (John Lithgow) has shown signs of being unstable, but he completely snaps when he discovers that his wife, Jenny (Lolita Davidovich), is having an affair.

Unfortunately, DePalma fails to deliver real fright or titillation to his target audience, instead opting for satire.", "Rather than clarifying, De Palma's technique with Raising Cain effectively obliterates the audience's bearings.", "Lithgow is consistently brilliant, while Davidovich makes a good fist as his wife. A really exciting 90 minutes worth, so long as you don't take it too seriously.", "A respectable if overly campy De Palma thriller. Like the director's Body Double, this plays better the second time you watch it.", "Creepy and effective", "", "Weak thriller. Lost potential.
