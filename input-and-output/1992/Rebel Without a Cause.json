{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After moving to a new town, troublemaking teen Jim Stark (James Dean) is supposed to have a clean slate, although being the new kid in town brings its own problems.

They are marked with the seal of the same fate, the same moral or physical disease that is not quite taint or decay.", "To audiences who don't immediately connect with the rebellion and delinquency, the film becomes little more than an annoyingly blatant message about teenage defiance.", "Possum's evocation of wrongness, that unbalancing feeling that something is off -- if only you could put your finger on it -- lingers long.", "It contains some extraordinarily good acting by the late James Dean, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo. The direction by Nicholas Ray is outstanding... This is a superficial treatment of a vital problem that has been staged brilliantly.", "With his slicked-up quiff, turned-up jeans and revved-up attitude, Dean instantly achieved icon status.", "Looks and sounds so good it makes your heart thump.", "Nicholas Ray's 1955 film extends sympathy to all its characters, not just the kids, though the central trio of Dean, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo focus our emotions.", "A mighty, ageless jolt of teen petulance. Dean is supreme.", "A superb study of teenage angst that still retains its power despite the number of inferior rip-offs that followed in its wake.", "[VIDEO ESSAY] \"Rebel Without a Cause\" (1955) is a pivotal film for many reasons - each as important as the next.", "1950s James Dean teen-rage landmark still resonates.", "This full-color, widescreen masterpiece gives us remarkable images.", "Fine generational drama-tragedy which helped give James Dean movie immortality.", "The drama and hepcat dialogue feel clunky now, but the movie's plea for dads to talk to their children -- what we now call emotional literacy -- is valid enough.", "For all its faults this is still the teen angst melodrama to end them all, and Dean's performance established him as an icon, a legend and a myth.", "An unmissable film, made with a delirious compassion.", "In this powerful study of juvenile violence, Dean is riveting as a teenager groping for love from a society he finds alien and oppressive.", "Here is a fairly exciting, suspenseful and provocative, if also occasionally far-fetched, melodrama of unhappy youth on another delinquency kick.", "If ever a film was haunted, it's \"Rebel Without a Cause,\" which burns as a bright memorial for stars James Dean, Natalie Wood and Sal Mineo."], "rating": ["2/4", "", "4/10", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "5/5", "5/5", "4/4", "A-", "5/5", "", "5/5", "3/5", "5/5", "", "4/4", "", "4/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Nusair", "\u00c9ric Rohmer", "Mike Massie", "Christopher Machell", "Jack Moffitt", "Kate Muir", "Charlotte O&#39;Sullivan", "Philip Kemp", "David Parkinson", "Matt Brunson", "Cole Smithey", "Charles Cassady", "Jeffrey M.
