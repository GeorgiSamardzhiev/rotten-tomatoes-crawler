The conflicts that they encounter along the way are by no means resolved, but the ending is satisfying just the same.", "Hsiao, like everyone else of his generation, can't move forward in this twilight, which is soon to enter a night that will be terminated by the dawn of new political arrangements in the region and a bright new class of consumer technologies.", "Not to suggest that cigarette smoking or petty crime is cool, but is it possible to have a cooler entrance than that of Ah Tze and Ah Bing, first seen robbing a blue-lit phone booth on a rainy night in Taipei, cigarettes dangling from their lips?", "We've seen these kids before, but we've never seen them quite like this.", "Like Godard's \"Breathless\" and Wong's \"As Tears Go By,\" \"Rebels\" cunningly synthesizes both B-movie and art film.", "A breathtaking, disturbing look at urban angst and the emptiness of youth culture ...", "More than just watching an early film by an untouchable master; it allows you to see his style with newly fresh eyes.", "It seems so fresh and immediate you'd never know that it's 23 years old.", "For fans of arthouse cinema, it's easily the most interesting thing to come along in some time.", "One of the great films about modern unrest and the pangs of youth. I can't wait to watch it again.", "A clinical, cool-suspicious dissection of disaffected youth maneuvering Taipei's grimier, noisier corners.", "Rebels of the Neon God still brims with the panache of someone still figuring himself out...", "Tsai's film is steeped in sweaty ennui. Somehow he's managed to capture the humid closeness of city dwelling on celluloid.", "[Rebels of the Neon God] is the director's most accessible film. That will seem like a funny observation once you've seen it, because Tsai's most accessible film is more unusual and uncompromising than any you're likely to see this year.", "Hsiao-Kang's bad night out is one of the things that marks Rebels as a Tsai Ming-liang film. There's never any real, safe home in his films.", "With longing gazes, antic and violent outbursts, and exquisite coincidences set amid his fetish objects-leaky pipes and bloody wounds, fast food and bathroom fixtures-Tsai depicts the city as a spontaneous, sticky, erotic ballet.", "In addition to having one of the best titles ever, \"Rebels of the Neon God\" marks the start of one of modern cinema's great careers."], "rating": ["", "7/10", "4/5", "9/10", "", "", "B", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "4/5", "4/4", "3.5/4", "A-", "", "3.5/4", "8.9/10", "3.5/4", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Dayne Linford", "Nathanael Hood", "Daniel Barnes", "Paul Parcellin", "Charles Mudede", "Sherilyn Connelly", "Tom Long", "Mark Jenkins", "Tirdad Derakhshani", "Matt Prigge", "G.
