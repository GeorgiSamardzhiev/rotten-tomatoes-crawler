{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Hando (Russell Crowe) and Davey (Daniel Pollock) are the leaders of a racist youth gang who spend their nights attacking Asian immigrants in a rough section of Melbourne. On the run after losing badly in a fight against the new Vietnamese owners of their local pub, the pair hook up with teenage junkie Gabe (Jacqueline McKenzie), who suggests robbing the mansion of her rich and sexually abusive father (Alex Scott).

However it is one of the finest films to be made in this country in recent years.", "", "Crowe is powerful and terrifying, and the erotic chemistry between Pollock and McKenzie is no less intense and enriched by strong performances by both.", "For all the dynamism and drive, the film walks a fine line between exposure and outright exploitation -- wherein lies much of its appeal.", "Romper Stomper is A Clockwork Orange without the intellect.", "Crowe first shows his star quality", "The cheap 'message' of the ending fails to salvage a film that at best is well-meant but misguided, at worst, flashy and garbled.", "Given his formidable presence and equal talent, it was only a matter of time before New Zealand-born, Australian-raised Russell Crowe made the mainstream American breakthrough he enjoyed with Gladiator.", "", "Romper Stomper is a convincing depiction of subculture, and one that dares to present these figures as real, troubled individuals rather than stereotypes.", "", "", "The film [has] a raw, sometimes discomfiting immediacy...
