{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this film about Ingmar Bergman's parents, young Henrik Bergman (Samuel Fr\u00f6ler) is studying for the priesthood and trying to make ends meet when he encounters the lovely, affluent Anna (Pernilla August). Despite their social differences, Henrik and Anna fall in love, wed and move to the country. They lead a quiet life as Henrik works as a clergyman, but it isn't long before the simple people and plain surroundings make Anna long for a more lavish lifestyle, which causes marital stress.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "3h 2m", "director": "Bille August", "studio": "SVTDrama,Yleisradio,DanmarksRadio", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 28, 2017", "box_office": "$1.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["By the end, we no longer know why characters are choosing to leave or stay, live or die. Even more depressingly, the director follows suit, allowing scenes to ramble on well past their bedtime, and the film loses its grip.", "August keeps a discreet distance from the harsher realities, making The Best Intentions must viewing only if you find diluted Bergman better than no Bergman at all.", "Though the level of acting is uniformly quite high, the true star of The Best Intentions is Bergman's script.", "Throughout, Bergman sets up a series of vivid, literate confrontations involving Frler, August and other articulated characters. Director August stages these tense, intimate, emotional wrestling matches with naturalistic fervor.", "The performances, though, are superbly understated-particularly the two leads, as well as Norby as Anna's commanding mother.", "The Best Intentions is the most moving film I've seen this year.", "Bergman's script succinctly weaves in refs to themes explored in his own earlier films, notably the destructive force of worship when used as a crutch for human weaknesses.", "With a running time of three hours, this weighty drama tests the most patient soul.", "Though Bergman only wrote (but didn't direct), the film is permeated with his unique angst and thematic concerns, and casting Pernilla August in a major role establishes strong link to Fanny and Alexander, in which she played the servant.", "For a time, The Best Intentions captures the elements of a profoundly difficult and credible love story, one plagued by essential differences that cannot be resolved.", "A deeply satisfying film.", "Makes the point that marriage always brings spirituality down to earth with its focus on the all the effort that goes into making an intimate relationship work.", "It remains a rare August pleasure, a film for grown-up audiences that challenges and enriches.", "Realized beautifully by director Bille August, Intentions is a moving, profound requiem to all human relationships.", "For those looking to be stylishly entertained while learning more than anyone might ever want to know about the formation of the Bergman psyche, well, here it is.", "The Best Intentions is full of high drama, but the low-key, matter-of-fact telling makes everything fall into order quite naturally.
