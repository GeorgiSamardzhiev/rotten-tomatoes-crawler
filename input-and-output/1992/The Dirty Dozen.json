{"metadata": {"synopsis": "As D-Day approaches, Colonel Breed hands the roguish Major Reisman (Lee Marvin) an important assignment: He must train a team of soldiers to parachute across enemy lines and assassinate German personnel at a French chateau. The soldiers, recruited from murderers, rapists and criminals on death row, are promised commuted sentences. In spite of their history, the 12 men prove a spirited and courageous unit. Led by Major Reisman, they will exact revenge.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h 29m", "director": "Robert Aldrich", "studio": "MetroGoldwynMayer,MKH,SevenArtsPictures", "theater_date": "Jun 15, 1967", "dvd_date": "May 8, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The Dirty Dozen with a fairly sharp script, plenty of excitement and adventure and a good cast still doesn't swim above the flood tide of over done World War II movie themes.", "It is another magnificent performance by Marvin. Among his men are Telly Savalas Jim Brown Clint Walker, Charles Bronson, John Cassavetes, Donald Sutherland, Trini Lopez and Al Mancini. Every one is a scene-stealer at one moment or another.", "In spite of an intelligent performance from Lee Marvin as the officer, director Robert Aldrich spins it out at such length that by the time the men actually get to France one has lost all interest.", "Robert Aldrich directs with great skill, but can't conceal the spurious ethics and titillating violence.", "The Dirty Dozen is a powerful motion picture concerned with rugged men bent on a ruthless mission. The climactic sequence is revolting.", "Is it possible to be seized by a melodrama strung up by its technical dexterity and hauled into a state of willing involvement without quite approving of the film in toe end?", "The picture's glorification of these swaggering, vicious criminals as heroes, its constant ridicule of discipline and authority and its depiction of the sadistic zeal with which the party goes about [killing] are grossly distasteful, sometimes revolting.", "An abundance of hilarious humor, injected by Mr. Aldrich, the star, Lee Marvin and the cast, is a blessed relief from the strain of gory details and grim aspects of war, fought by a mere handful of American on foreign soil.", "The film is lengthy, but the minutes are never wasted.", "The Dirty Dozen is not the first movie to treat its audience with contempt. But the film is uncannily, frighteningly in keeping with today's military mentality.", "The hours fly by, the action is well directed and the laughs are numerous. But relevant connective tissue between the episodes seems to be missing.", "One of the three or four best American films of the year.", "Unarguably one of the great war movies of all time.", "On the question of the fighting itself Aldrich has played the whole thing for conventional heroics and bloody fun, with every war cliche in the book.", "It must just be taken as another violence-fantasy no better and no worse than a dozen others.", "Robert Aldrich dissects the underlying ideas with just enough craft and thoughtfulness to make the implications of this gritty 1966 war drama unsettling in not entirely constructive ways.", "The lopsided interpretation works largely because of a fine cast and a taut plot that closes the credibility gap.", "Big, brutal and expertly executed, The Dirty Dozen is a quintessential, made-for-men war flick.", "One of the smash hits of its year, this action-packed war movie is violent and amoral, and fans would say all the better for it.", "Slambang funny, and extremely violent for its time."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "4/4", "8/10", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Robert E.
