{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When she was assaulted by her doctor, Claire Bartel (Annabella Sciorra) reported him to the police, and rather than go to prison for his crime, he killed himself. The shock of the accusations and suicide caused the doctor's pregnant wife, Peyton (Rebecca De Mornay), to have a miscarriage. Driven mad with rage, Peyton poses as a nanny for the Bartel family. Her plan: to tear Claire's life apart, seduce her husband (Matt McCoy) and eventually murder the woman she blames for ruining her life.", "rating": "63", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 50m", "director": "Curtis Hanson", "studio": "HollywoodPictures,InterscopeCommunications", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$87.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["De Mornay's performance vacillates so wildly between sweet solicitousness and icy murderousness that it draws as many giggles as gasps.", "Disturbing thriller about a babysitter; cursing, violence.", "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle is that rare thing, a realistic thriller wise enough not to sell short any of its characters. Just be prepared to become very, very scared when you see it.", "This is De Mornay's film and she's a wicked treat, looking daggers at her enemy one moment and then glazing over with sweetness the next.", "This is pure unbridled hokum, of course, but extremely effective until the last 30 minutes, when the plot rapidly self-destructs.", "The film is unusually gripping.", "All of the best parts here go to women -- Sciorra, De Mornay and Julianne Moore in a funny supporting bit as Claire's cynical, suspicious friend.", "The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, though it positions itself as chilling suspense, is not even mildly scary; it's just offensive.", "The careful structure of THTRTC guarantees that the movie will generate a fair amount of suspense throughout. But the single-mindedness of the movie is a genuine limitation, and, watching it, you begin to feel spoon-fed.", "With its banal, docile household threatened by an enemy within, the film is like The Stepfather without wit or irony.", "At its best, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle is a bright, nasty psychological thriller with a joker up its sleeve.", "Exploitation of child abuse and baby-stealing make this one a particularly nasty business.", "Unpretentious and efficient.", "Things go about the way you expect them to, but Curtis Hanson, who directed, manages to make it work.", "Five years before adapting and directing the modern masterpiece L.A. Confidential, Curtis Hanson helmed this sizable box office hit that, like 1987's Fatal Attraction, used home invasion as a crafty commercial hook.", "The Hand That Rocks the Cradle keeps you watching, yet this oddly somber thriller is really just a transparent chain of contrivances; it's all stunts, all concept.", "Peyton plays upon Claire's deepest anxieties -- her sexual insecurity, her fear of child molesters -- to vicious effect. Hanson and Silver manipulate our anxieties no less adeptly, but a good deal more playfully.", "De Mornay seems to have found her true vocation playing the nanny from hell, but while the ensuing thrills may well be enjoyed by many, anyone with offspring of their own would be wise to stay away.", "This jovially sinister, middle-class morality tale-cum-horror show is predictable, implausible and fiendishly entertaining.", "A low-key thriller that will make baby boomers double-check the references of any prospective nanny."], "rating": ["", "3/5", "", "3/4", "4/5", "2.5/4", "3/4", "", "3/5", "", "3.5/5", "", "3/4", "", "2.5/4", "B-", "", "", "3.5/4", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Malcolm Johnson", "Andrea Beach", "Candice Russell", "Michael Upchurch", "Sue Heal", "Carrie Rickey", "Gary Thompson", "Leah Rozen", "Jay Boyar", "Michael Sragow", "Peter Rainer", "David Sterritt", "Dave Kehr", "Lou Cedrone", "Matt Brunson", "Owen Gleiberman", "David Ansen", "", "", "Variety Staff"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety"], "date": ["May 30, 2018", "November 28, 2017", "July 10, 2013", "July 10, 2013", "July 10, 2013", "July 10, 2013", "July 10, 2013", "July 10, 2013", "July 10, 2013", "July 10, 2013", "July 10, 2013", "July 10, 2013", "July 10, 2013", "July 10, 2013", "September 13, 2012", "September 7, 2011", "October 18, 2008", "April 14, 2008", "April 14, 2008", "April 14, 2008"]}}
