{"metadata": {"synopsis": "It's the 1930s, and as the people he cares for die or leave his village, young South African P.K. bonds with much older Doc (Armin Mueller-Stahl). A foreigner, Doc is detained when World War II starts, but from his prison cell he encourages P.K. to learn boxing. As he travels to different bouts, the adult P.K. (Stephen Dorff) forges relationships that anger the state's apartheid government -- but his reunion with his onetime schoolyard nemesis (Daniel Craig) may offer his biggest challenge yet.", "rating": "39", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "John G.

If there's any justice, the birds of loneliness will be circling the box office.", "It's resounding bunk, candied over with the lush music of Johnny Clegg and hyped to death by director John (\"Rocky\") Avildsen.", "\"The Power of One\" begins with a canvas that involves all of the modern South African dilemma, and ends as a boxing movie. Somewhere in between, it loses its way.", "Mostly, it's a long, heavy-handed narrative about the personal costs of South Africa's system of apartheid, set in the removed safety of bygone decades and mixed with generous helpings of Chariots of Fire and Rocky.", "Though rife with worthy intentions and great notions, this populist safari manages to be both patronizing and manipulative.", "The Power of One spends so much screen time reveling in the eloquence and bravery of its hero and depicting South Africa's blacks as an anonymous horde of victims that the film, in effect, becomes their victimizer."], "rating": ["", "", "4/5", "2/5", "1.5/5", "3/5", "4/5", "1/5", "", "1/5", "3/5", "4/5", "", "", "2.5/4", "1/5", "", "D"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Variety Staff", "Derek Adams", "Michael Szymanski", "Emanuel Levy", "Janet Maslin", "Daniel M.
