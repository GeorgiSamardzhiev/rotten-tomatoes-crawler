Then The Turning can suddenly hit you with some of the best Australian filmmaking seen in years.", "While it demands substantial concentration from the audience, this elegant and suspenseful epic more than rewards the effort.", "If nothing else, The Turning is probably value for money. Quantity counts for something, after all, as do good intentions. But they can't ever fully satisfy.", "Winton is important to Australian culture, but a less fragmented, reverent approach would serve his work better.", "The films are rich and diverse, moving from the warm humour of Cate Blanchett reconnecting with her mother-in-law to a battered Rose Byrne having visions of Jesus.", "Life-changing moments feature in each of the nine short films in this Australian anthology, and each is told with remarkable artistry and sensitivity.", "The film rewards the patient, with the most compelling entries stacked in the back half.", "The cream of Australian acting talent features in this portmanteau picture, based on interlinking short stories by Tim Winton.", "The Turning is a collection of nine short films based on Tim Winton's stories, some of which are more satisfying than others but in all they give a sense of Australian landscape and life at the edges.", "It was first conceived as an art project, and is perhaps best viewed that way.", "Even at the level of the individual short film it looks disconcertingly unfinished and unformed, each piece seeming like a sketch for something bigger.", "There's much to admire in this compilation of Australian short films, but the run-time is far too punishing.", "The stories and their themes are depicted as Joycean-style epiphanies or meditations on being and time.", "An adaptation of Australian author Tim Winton's 2005 collection of short stories, The Turning is a beguiling piece of storytelling.", "With each episode produced by its own individual creative team, the lack of continuity can disorientate. But it's this daring mix of styles that gives The Turning its creative energy and distinct off-kilter flavour.", "Cate Blanchett and Rose Byrne desperate housewives down under. And as much an ordeal for admittedly clueless audiences unfamiliar with the source material as for the characters. But for those with patience, the periodic pleasures of these bracing yarns.", "Ambition shines through every frame of The Turning.", "Who knew that the next great Australian film would actually be a constellation of 17 smaller ones? It's not easy viewing but it is beautiful viewing.", "The work creates its own rhythms and moods, and weaves a rich tapestry of human experience that keeps us engaged. That is the film's achievement", "The film's striking landscape is like a winding road that links the thoughts, ideas and senses evoked by Tim Winton's stories as themes of regret, guilt and renewal wind their way through the diverse narratives"], "rating": ["4/5", "", "", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "2/5", "2/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3/5", "", "4.5/5", "8/10", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Leigh Paatsch", "Rachael Mead", "James Robert Douglas", "Siobhan Synnot", "Mark Kermode", "Rich Cline", "Guy Lodge", "Geoffrey Macnab", "Kate Muir", "Damon Wise", "Peter Bradshaw", "Sophie Monks Kaufman", "Martyn Conterio", "Nikki Baughan", "James Mottram", "Prairie Miller", "Damien Straker", "Lauren Carroll Harris", "Andrew L.
