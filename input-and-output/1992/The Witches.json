As for Dahl, he initially tried to have his name removed from the picture.", "Chock-full of gleeful nastiness, The Witches also retains a clear focus on its young audience, often with a mouse-view of the world.", "...could care less about catering to a child's more delicate sensibilities.", "It's not a film for small children.

Harry Potter was never like this.", "Real darkness seethes beneath the \"Once upon a time\" surface, mostly due to Henson's seemingly curious selection of the brilliant and audacious Roeg to direct.", "Based on a Roald Dahl book, Nicholas Roeg's The Witches is a film surprisingly faithful to the creepiness of the original.", "Roald Dahl's book about a little boy on a seaside holiday who discovers a witches' convention plotting to annihilate children is brilliantly brought to life in this fantasy adventure by director Nicolas Roeg.", "What a lot of fun is The Witches. A few days before Labor Day, it is safe to say that it`s the most enjoyable movie of the summer.", "The scenes of magic and mayhem are peppered with sly surprises, and Anjelica Huston plays the wildest wicked witch since Dorothy got back from Oz.", "The Witches is a slow-to-get-going but ultimately entertaining yarn about a nasty coven conspiring to turn Britain's entire populace of single-digiters into mice.", "The Witches has an engrossing story populated with many amusing characters."], "rating": ["6/10", "8/10", "", "3/4", "2.5/4", "", "", "4/5", "2.5/4", "4/5", "3.5/4", "4/4", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "3/4", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Aaron Neuwirth", "Rick Chatenever", "Jeff Simon", "James Berardinelli", "Steve Persall", "Madame X", "Jamie Broadnax", "Matt Brunson", "Sarah Cartland", "Josh Larsen", "Michael Upchurch", "", "Michael Wilmington", "Ada Calhoun", "Tom Hutchinson", "Candice Russell", "David Sterritt", "Steven Rea", "Gary Thompson"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">We Live Entertainment", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Santa Cruz Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Buffalo News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ReelViews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tampa Bay Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">OutWeek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Black Girl Nerds", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Frenzy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Caution Spoilers", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Austin Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News"], "date": ["September 25, 2020", "August 13, 2020", "August 11, 2020", "August 11, 2020", "August 11, 2020", "August 11, 2020", "May 21, 2020", "October 6, 2019", "September 14, 2019", "September 1, 2019", "June 24, 2016", "November 25, 2013", "November 25, 2013", "November 25, 2013", "November 25, 2013", "November 25, 2013", "November 25, 2013", "November 25, 2013", "November 22, 2013", "November 22, 2013"]}}
