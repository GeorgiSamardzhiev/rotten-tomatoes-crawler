To escape, Zoran eats prodigiously and worships Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito (Voja Brajovic), so much so that he wants to know all about the man. Zoran gets to go on a guided historical tour of Yugoslavia, and he then learns that his hero might not be the great man he imagined.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Goran Markovic", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 26, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", ""], "rating": ["2/5", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Emanuel Levy", "James Berardinelli"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ReelViews"], "date": ["August 14, 2005", "February 27, 2001"]}}
