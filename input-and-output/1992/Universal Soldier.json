While Devereaux and Scott initially have no memory of their former lives, glimpses of their pasts start to return, rekindling their intense conflict.", "rating": "33", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Roland Emmerich", "studio": "CentropolisFilmProductions,IndieProd,CarolcoPicturesInc.", "theater_date": "Jul 10, 1992", "dvd_date": "Oct 8, 2016", "box_office": "$35.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Fortunately, the characters all behave seriously, frequently stifling any hint of empathy - but their dialogue and actions scream of silliness.", "All brawn, no brains, but grows on you if you can prefer your action in one big, dumb hulking slab of alpha-male aggression.", "Cringe-inducing dialogue?
