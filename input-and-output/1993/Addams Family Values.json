{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The members of the odd Addams Family are up to more macabre antics in this sequel. This time around, Gomez Addams (Raul Julia) and his wife, Morticia (Anjelica Huston), are celebrating the arrival of a baby boy. But siblings Wednesday (Christina Ricci) and Pugsley (Jimmy Workman) are none too happy about the new addition, and try their best to eliminate the infant. When nanny Debbie Jelinsky (Joan Cusack) appears to keep the kids in line, her presence leads to an unexpected treacherous twist.", "rating": "77", "genre": "Comedy/Horror", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Barry Sonnenfeld", "studio": "ParamountPictures,OrionPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "Nov 19, 1993", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$45.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A fantasy comedy suitable for all ages.", "If you didn't like the original Addams Family movie, there's plenty happening in this far superior sequel.", "lives up to and even surpasses its predecessor in conveying the titular family's wonderful weirdness", "In the sequel-crazed 1990s, there are few if any examples of a thoroughly worthwhile follow-up that's more obviously motivated by the delighted joy of its creators.", "Sonnenfeld expands the world and makes the film a bit more palatable with a sketch comedy feel that lets the Addams' twisted sense of humor take center stage.", "The rare sequel that improves upon its predecessor.", "The best parts of this film were the shortest. More Wednesday and Pugsley; less Uncle Fester, plz.", "There is little real value in this return of the Addams family.", "Uneven as it is, Addams Family Values is considerably more enjoyable than its predecessor. At this rate, if there's a third installment, it'll be a knockout. Or at least a TKO.", "This delightful follow-up to The Addams Family is blessed with an even blacker vein of humour than the original.", "You've got to respect a comedy that makes light of arson, torture, and murder in these squeamish times.", "Somehow, the new production fails to sustain the creepy, kooky, mysterious, spooky and altogether ooky visual sweep that held the first film together.", "Surprise, surprise -- Addams Family Values is more wicked, more warped and more tightly wound than The Addams Family. It's a dark comedy on the edge, way on the edge, and perhaps twice as funny as the original.", "At its best, it's a valentine of venom, sent with mirth and malice aforethought.", "Even if the sequel doesn't offer the delight of discovery, the trip back to Chateau Addams is more than the dead end it could have been.", "Though this sequel probably has more creative energy than its predecessor, the constant stream of one-liners and sight gags is very much hit or miss.", "Addams Family Values turns out to be both a trick and a treat.", "", "This sequel to the 1990 picture contains some funny scenes and witty one-liners.", "A dark comedy teens will love."], "rating": ["", "3/5", "3/4", "4/5", "B", "3/4", "", "", "3.5/5", "4/5", "", "", "", "3/4", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "3/4", "B", "B-", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Charlotte Harrison", "Leigh Paatsch", "James Kendrick", "Tim Brayton", "James Clay", "Matt Brunson", "Leona Laurie", "Malcolm Johnson", "Peter Rainer", "John Ferguson", "Michael Sragow", "Jay Boyar", "Candice Russell", "Michael Wilmington", "Steven Rea", "Gary Thompson", "Stephen Hunter", "Owen Gleiberman", "Emanuel Levy", "Polly M.
