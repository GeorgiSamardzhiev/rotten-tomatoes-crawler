{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In an Italian seaside town, young Titta (Bruno Zanin) gets into trouble with his friends and watches various local eccentrics as they engage in often absurd behavior. Frequently clashing with his stern father (Armando Brancia) and defended by his doting mother (Pupella Maggio), Titta witnesses the actions of a wide range of characters, from his extended family to Fascist loyalists to sensual women, with certain moments shifting into fantastical scenarios.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 5m", "director": "Federico Fellini", "studio": "PECF", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Its people look neither funny nor touching, neither monstrous nor human; they are mere lay figures tugged about aimlessly to fill out the space of the screen, the prescribed time for a major movie, and the leaky balloon of Fellini's ego.", "Compared with [Fellini's] other recent films, Amarcord is simple and classic to the point of self-denial.", "This classic is sentimental, crude, sexy, comical and romantic.", "The result is touching, sad and wonderfully bittersweet.", "Fellini shoots much of the film in muted colors that seem slightly out-of-focus, as if he were attempting to transport us into a dreamlike state.", "Fellini's ability to compose a frame that oozes baroque drama and vitality is almost unparalleled and Amarcord more or less succeeded for me in evoking a time period through the eyes of a young boy...", "", "", "Sweet and endearing for many, irritating and tedious for others.", "Continues to resemble something a lewd, grouchy, fitfully indecent silent-movie director might have made for his first time using color and sound. That, at least, would explain the shouting.", "Seen today, Amarcord is something of a disappointment, clever and moving in places, but also sprawling, undisciplined, clumsy in patches, and decidedly overlong.", "[S]imply nonsensical to me. Fascists are idiots, Catholic priests are clowns -- I agree with this. So why don't I feel it?", "Fellini is so bountiful with incident and observation that he makes most other film makers seem stingy.", "Bloated, overblown and essentially empty, Fellini's last hit movie skims over the surface of the lives it depicts, substituting manufactured sentiment for genuine feeling or understanding.", "Amarcord will make you howl with laughter and then choke back a tear. And all the while you'll be building your own memories of this landmark movie.", "Watching the movie feels like flipping through a cartoon sketchbook of Fellini's vivid remembrances and formative experiences.", "I'm not sure how Amarcord played in the '70s, but now it feels like an affectionate parody of Italian movie conventions.", "Amarcord is Fellini's scrapbook of memories culled from his own life and it is completely engaging and delightful.", "Orthodox Fellini lovers will give primacy to La Strada or La Dolce Vita, but Amarcord has its fans, and it's easy to see why.", "It's one of the noted Italian directors more vibrant films that captures him at his most playful and incisive."], "rating": ["", "", "4/4", "", "8", "", "5/5", "5/5", "5/10", "2.5/4", "3/4", "", "", "", "4/4", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "B+"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["John Simon", "John Russell Taylor", "Matt Brunson", "Jacoba Atlas", "Dan Jardine", "Glenn Dunks", "David Fear", "Ben Kenigsberg", "Christopher Long", "Wesley Morris", "Gerald Peary", "MaryAnn Johanson", "Jay Cocks", "Jamie Russell", "Robert W.
