{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When Sally Matthews (Susan Sarandon) leaves her Canadian home to relocate to Atlantic City, she aspires to a prosperous career in the gambling industry. With her criminal husband (Robert Joy) on her trail, however, it appears that she can't escape from trouble, until she finds an unlikely savior in Lou Pascal (Burt Lancaster), an aging small-time mobster. By becoming involved with Sally, Lou finds a way to achieve the success he's dreamed of, but his plan may endanger both their lives.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Louis Malle", "studio": "Paramount", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Atlantic City references the action genre only to dismantle it from the inside... With feeling and exuberance, Louis Malle constructs a spectacle. [Full Review in Spanish]", "It combines French discipline and nonchalance with an American generosity and high spirits. The dialogue is precise and often witty, qualities it shares with the acting.", "It abounds in heroics, glories in coincidence, indulges in sentiment, laughs at Cupid's bizarre sense of humor and provides sumptuous parts for the five leading players, who know how to seize their opportunities.", "\"Atlantic City\" is full of compact social editorializing that elevates its seemingly run-of-the-mill trappings into something sublime by way of its emotionally dependent characters.", "[Sarandon is] shirtless before she even has a name, but her desire to be ogled is granted dignity and power; gradually and unassumingly, she upstages a terrific Burt Lancaster.", "A shimmering success.", "\"Atlantic City\" is a sophisticated fairy tale, beautifully acted and beautiful to behold; it is as funny as it is touching.", "Malle pulls off a minor coup here, celebrating his wounded characters even as he mercilessly reveals their dreams for the hopeless illusions they really are.", "For all the flaws in the plot, the triumvurate of Malle, Lancaster and Sarandon give this moody little thriller a seductive, lingering power.", "A well observed and deeply tender tale.", "Film is blessed with a spare, intriguing script by Yank John Guare, which always skirts impending cliches and predictability by finding unusual facets in his characters and their actions.", "", "Eclectic, pacy and hard to categorise, it's part crime thriller, part love story, part fairytale, and part a gentle, generous examination of certain dying aspects of American culture.", "This lyrical tale set in Atlantic City in times of change is full of offbeat characters. It is evocatively directed by Louis Malle in his second (and better) American film and well acted by Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon as the odd romantic couple.", "What makes \"Atlantic City\" sweet -- and that's the word for it -- is the gentleness with which Lou handles his last chance at amounting to something, and the wisdom with which Sally handles Lou.", "Intriguing from beginning to end.", "If you don't already love Sarandon, this is the feature that would do it. Director and the 2 stars mesh their talents beautifully.", "Poignant, atmospheric mood piece with pristine performances by Lancaster and Sarandon.", "Pleasingly unsentimental.", ""], "rating": ["", "", "", "A+", "", "", "4/5", "3.5/4", "3/5", "5/5", "", "5/5", "", "5/5", "", "4/5", "5/5", "4/5", "B", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["El Pais Staff", "Peter Ackroyd", "Robert Hatch", "Cole Smithey", "Eric Hynes", "Dave Kehr", "Kevin Thomas", "", "", "Kim Newman", "Variety Staff", "Cole Smithey", "Geoff Andrew", "Emanuel Levy", "Roger Ebert", "Alex Sandell", "Brandon Judell", "Nick Davis", "Dennis Schwartz", "Mark R.
