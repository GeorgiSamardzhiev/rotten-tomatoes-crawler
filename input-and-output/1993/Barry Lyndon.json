It's boring and exhausting, and ends up being too long, almost ineffective. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Barry Lyndon is a deeply felt, sometimes brutally ironic, and always visually gorgeous summation of the wide breadth of human experience.", "It's a stunning, sumptuous and sustained meditation on man's ultimate powerlessness.", "Barry Lyndon is, despite its rigorous construction, also among Kubrick's more emotionally engaged films.", "The wonderfully dry and witty narration is from Thackeray, delivered by Michael Horder.", "...a maddeningly hit-and-miss drama that's all-too-often far more miss than it is hit.", "It just hangs there on the screen for three hours, a monument to Kubrick's patience and pedantry and rather laborious good taste, but signifying very little else.", "The expressive authority of Kubrick's direction is breathtaking.", "It's gorgeous to look at, with its reverse zooms that slowly widen to stunning rural panoramas, its beautiful framing, its delight in decorative detail. You feel you are watching a masterclass in how to recreate the look and feel of the late 18th century.", "This is a period film like no other, a slow but utterly hypnotic tale of an Irish youth whose adventures and misfortunes take in the Seven Years' War, the gambling clubs of Europe and marriage into the English aristocracy.", "Ryan O'Neal has the role of his career as Redmond Barry, an Irish rogue who lies, fights and sleeps his way to prominence in 18th century society.", "As leisurely as it is painterly, this is a masterclass in cinematography - famously, Kubrick used nothing but natural light in all but a few scenes. Don't miss the chance to watch it in a cinema.", "Every frame of every battle scene or courtly interlude is exhaustively and exquisitely detailed.", "It is Kubrick's most moving film, and his most deeply felt exploration of romantic desire.", "There are few films so sumptuous that you almost require fabric swatches while watching -- peachy moir\u00e9 silks, red brocades, eau de nil satins, lilac-grey velvets -- and that's just the menswear and the furniture."], "rating": ["4/5", "", "", "", "", "", "4/4", "5/5", "5/5", "4/4", "2/4", "", "5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "David A.
