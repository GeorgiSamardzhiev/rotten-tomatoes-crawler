{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When an elderly millionaire is found dead with cocaine in his system, his will leaves $8 million to Rebecca Carlson (Madonna), who was having an affair with him. District attorney Robert Garrett (Joe Mantegna) decides to prosecute Rebecca, arguing that she deliberately engaged in wild sex with the old man to overexcite him and lead to his premature death. Defense attorney Frank Dulaney (Willem Dafoe) defends Rebecca in court while getting sucked into a dangerous affair with her.", "rating": "8", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "Uli Edel", "studio": "DinodeLaurentiisCorp.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 10, 2017", "box_office": "$13.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This movie makes Basic Instinct look like a masterpiece.", "Body of Evidence won't be remembered for classic plotting or brilliant legal gambits.
