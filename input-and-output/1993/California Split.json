{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Carefree single guy Charlie Waters (Elliott Gould) rooms with two lovely prostitutes, Barbara Miller (Ann Prentiss) and Susan Peters (Gwen Welles), and lives to gamble.

While Charlie and Bill have some lucky moments, they also have to contend with serious setbacks that threaten to derail their hedonistic betting binge.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Robert Altman", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 14, 2014", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The pace rarely flags.", "'California Split' perfectly captures the denigrating, excessive and addicted environments of the game, and never exalts it. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The movie suffers from Altman's apparently ever more unshakable idiosyncrasies. Foremost among these is the notion that life is a series of tragicomic whimsies -- that it is, somehow, sadly cute.", "California Split has never been heralded as one of the key Altmans. But the few things it does - friendship and disappointment and the drab and desperate thrill of the gambler's life - it does superbly.", "The Odd Couple of poker films", "Funny as hell.", "Nothing enhances Altman's visual-aural density like the bustle of poker circles, race tracks, boxing rings", "Sold as a comedy, the film scans more like American-century Dostoyevsky, with comp cocktails.", "Robert Altman's masterful 1974 study of the psychology of the compulsive gambler.", "A film such as this, which is essentially a series of comic vignettes without a plot, depends upon its performances, and both Gould and Segal are in top form.", "The film is technically and physically handsome, all the more so for being mostly location work, but lacks a cohesive and reinforced sense of story direction.", "...the big thing holding back American movies is that they aren't more like California Split.", "Adding emphasis on the homo-ness of their lucrative bond are the repeated instances where the interference of women breaks both their concentration and their hot streaks.", "Altman feels rather than thinks his way into a subject, with a special interest in how people relate to one another in moments of crisis.", "A fascinating, vivid movie, not quite comparable to any other movie that I can immediately think of. Nor is it easily categorized.", "What Altman comes up with is sometimes almost a documentary feel; at the end of California Split we know something about organized gambling in this country we didn't know before.", "he two actors' inventive, improvized banter is a treat, and they are ably supported by Prentiss and Welles, both given room and encouragement to make their mark by the director."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "7", "A-", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "3/4", "", "4/5", "4/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Dick Lochte", "Alberto Abu\u00edn", "John Simon", "Alan Scherstuhl", "Dan Jardine", "Dennis Schwartz", "Fernando F.
