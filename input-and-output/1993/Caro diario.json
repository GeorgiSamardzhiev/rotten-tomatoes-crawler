{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Filmmaker Nanni Moretti (Nanni Moretti) goes on three disparate journeys. First, he rides through Rome on a scooter, musing on cinema, and has a chance encounter with actress Jennifer Beals (Jennifer Beals). Next, he and his friend, Gerardo (Renato Carpentieri), tour a number of islands searching for a peaceful place to write a screenplay. And finally, Moretti, hampered by a nagging skin rash, goes from doctor to doctor looking for the right diagnosis, which may or may not turn out to be severe.", "rating": "68", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Nanni Moretti", "studio": "RAIRadiotelevisioneItaliana,LaSeptCinema,Banfilm,LeStudioCanal+,SacherFilm", "theater_date": "Sep 30, 1994", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$445.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The two first segments house some charming interludes amidst the meandering framework but the final segment largely falls flat despite being the most weighty section.", "Generally strikes a cross between deadpan and absurd; most of it is stuff that would likely never happen, but Moretti captures it all with straight-faced seriousness.", "Caro diario is as much a guided tour of Italy as it is of a man's minor midlife crisis.", "This comic travelogue is like a \"Manhattan\" era Woody Allen starring in an Italian/Roman version of Richard Linklater's \"Slacker\" -- droll, scenic and adorable.", "In the film, the matter of cinema is the process of creativity, arduous and unrealized, as it ebbs and flows.", "This light-toned but thematically substantial autofiction is organized like a sequence of diary entries brought to life with Moretti's wryly confessional voice-overs.", "An ideal introduction to Moretti's work, this 1993 pseudo-documentary is weightier than it appears, a symbolic autobiography rather than a literal one.", "The scene in which he berates the pro-Henry critic is a funny, irresistible idea, but I'll bet Pasolini would have appreciated Henry.", "To be as self-indulgent as Moretti, you either have to be very witty, like Woody Allen, to whom Moretti is often compared, or have really sharp ideas. Here, Moretti fails on both counts. His film is little more than a doodle.", "A muddled story that I found foreign to my taste.\"", "Made after Nanni Moretti's bout with cancer, this funny and witty travelogue is whimsical yet also grave and resonant, establishing its actor-director as first rate coemdian, along with Chaplin, Keaton, and Woody Allen.", "", "", "", "Nanni is brilliant in this lovely travelogue!", "Diverting entertainment offering fresh food for thought on media, travel and health.", "Caro Diario is like a sketchbook that shows us what its creator saw, but not always what he thought.", "", ""], "rating": ["2.5/4", "3.5/4", "", "3/4", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "", "C+", "B+", "3/5", "1.5/4", "7/10", "4/5", "", "2.5/4", "4.5/5", "2/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Matt Brunson", "Jeffrey M.
