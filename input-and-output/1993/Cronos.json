{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Antique dealer Jesus Gris (Federico Luppi) stumbles across Cronos, a 400-year-old scarab that, when it latches onto him, grants him youth and eternal life -- but also a thirst for blood. As Jesus enjoys his newfound vitality, he's unaware that a dying old man, Dieter de la Guardia (Claudio Brook), has sent his nephew, Angel (Ron Perlman), to find the scarab and bring it back to him. But Jesus will not give immortality up easily, even risking the life of his orphan granddaughter (Tamara Shanath).", "rating": "91", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Guillermo del Toro", "studio": "VentanaFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 2, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["That sort of horror is a lot more introspective and messier to dissect, but much like other films in Guillermo del Toro's oeuvre, Cronos is all the more existentially horrifying the longer it sits with you.", "A really fun atmospheric little horror movie", "A haunting little film that would augur greater successes such as Pan's and del Toro's 2001 masterpiece The Devil's Backbone.", "Cronos, the crafty debut of a young Mexican filmmaker named Guillermo del Toro, emerged as a warning shot. His tale of vampirism and immortality is half horror, half historical fable-like all the best del Toro work to come.", "From the prologue, it becomes clear that del Toro possesses an extraordinary vivid pictorial sense.", "\"Not everything is garbage,\" Dieter insists to his thuggish nephew Angel (Perlman)... Del Toro, too, knows that he is working in a genre typically dismissed as trash, but nonetheless, like an alchemist, transmutes it into pure cinematic gold.", "It's part melodrama, part morality play and part thriller, more Dorian Gray than Bram Stoker and infused with a heady alchemic brew of ancient science, supernatural shadows, mutant organisms, demented villains...", "Guillermo del Toro's feature debut is an arch twist on the vampire tale.", "Cronos surprises with its sophisticated and spirited look at a tale straight from the crypt.", "A compelling, complex and wonderfully atmospheric film from Mexican director Guillermo del Toro that is as much about religion and the nature of cinema as it is a horror story.", "While the film's first half entices with its secrets, the second half falls into a predictable narrative that refuses to even suggest possibilities.", "Stylishly dusted with musty mysticism, Cronos never sinks its teeth to the bone, but despite some grumbling plot-cogs, del Toro's hallmarks -- tragic heart, splatty body horror, prickly insect-fear -- all gestate wickedly.", "A charming horror movie, if such a thing is possible.", "A low-budget horror/fantasy with some rough edges, Cronos reveals the dark genius of Guillermo del Toro's fecund mind.", "Many of the aesthetic qualities and thematic devices that Mexican director Guillermo del Toro would employ in later movies are already on the boil in his debut feature, Cronos.", "Del Toro conjures up a delightfully potent atmosphere and motion for it, born no doubt of a real appreciation for such things.", "Guillermo del Toro says, \"Cronos is an exploded view of my brain.\"", "The truly child-bound perspectives of The Devil's Backbone and Pan's Labyrinth are still to come, though Aurora has flights of del Torian wonder.", "... a weird, heady alchemic brew of antiquated clockwork mechanism, mutant organisms, demented villains driven by a greed for youth...", "A beautifully creepy, hypnotic horror-thriller that paints a vivid picture of why del Toro is such a beloved, wonderfully haunting filmmaker today."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "4/5", "2.5/4", "3/5", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "8.5/10", "", "8/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Leigh Monson", "Rachel Wagner", "David Harris", "Sean Fennessey", "Malcolm Johnson", "Anton Bitel", "Sean Axmaker", "Steven Rea", "Kenneth Turan", "David Parkinson", "Achy Obejas", "", "Film4 Staff", "Christopher Lloyd", "Simon Foster", "Jeffrey M.
