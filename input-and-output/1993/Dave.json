{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Shifty White House chief of staff Bob Alexander (Frank Langella) hatches a scheme to use a double for the president (Kevin Kline) at a public photo opportunity. Small business owner Dave Kovic (Kline) fits the bill, but after the president suffers a debilitating stroke, opportunist Alexander arranges for Dave to step in full time without even informing the First Lady (Sigourney Weaver). It doesn't take long before the press, the nation and the president's wife realize something is different.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 50m", "director": "Ivan Reitman", "studio": "Donner/Schuler-Donner,NorthernLightsEntertainment,WarnerBrothers", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 1, 2009", "box_office": "$61.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["\"Dave\" is the very model of a modern Capraesque comedy, being the story of a little guy who triumphs, through pluck and luck, over a corrupt system.", "It's a high-concept premise that's employed to watchable yet erratic effect by Ivan Reitman...", "Layering this sweet comedic story with some sharp, editorial barbs, screenwriter Gary Ross has fashioned an engaging, brainy comedy.", "It's the spritely comic timing of the fine Hollywood ensemble that keeps Dave percolating. This affable, well-built comedy is Reitman's best since Ghostbusters.", "Paying an homage to the prior work of the great Frank Capra, Dave offers a fresh contemporary take on a classic trope.", "It's opportunistic, superficial, and great fun.", "A genial, expertly played political comedy proves that the spirit of Mr. Smith still lives.", "It's impossible to say whether Dave will play as wonderfully over the decades as it does right now, but this smooth-as-silk comedy could not be more timely, or connect more hopefully with our current national consciousness.", "[A] delightful, gentle satire on the Washington political scene.", "While it's sloppy and draggy in parts, Kevin Kline, in the title role, delivers an ingratiating comedic performance.", "Dave isn't too careful about filling plot holes. It does a pretty fair job, however, of making jokes at the expense of the D.C. political scene.", "As Kline begins to take his presidential duties seriously, the comedy seeps out, a listless civic-mindedness drifts in like fog off the Potomac.", "Despite the familiar echoes, the film works more often than it should. Without the charming Kevin Kline in two roles, plot problems would yawn like sinkholes.", "Kline is so polished and resourceful that he can glide his way through even the creakiest bits and make them seem fresh.", "Though replete with amusing situations and clever lines, its strongest suit is the delicately pitched comic performances of its actors, most especially star Kevin Kline.", "After the promisingly nasty beginning, the filmmakers settle into a sort of campaign mode, lulling and flattering the audience with a fairy-tale vision of the common man's victory over the Washington establishment.", "Despite its predictability this is one of director Reitman's best films, a gentle satire which provides Kline with one of his most likeable characters.", "Kline gives a tremendously likable performance as the ersatz president, and Sigourney Weaver brings charm and elegance to the role of First Lady who's as ignorant of the switcheroo as the rest of the country.", "Reitman keeps coming up with bouncy new directions to take the somewhat predictable material, greatly helped by Kline's bounce.", "Dave has been directed by Ivan Reitman in a refreshingly restrained fashion -- there are plenty of quiet passages, rare for American movies these days -- which compliments Kevin Kline's wonderful work as well."], "rating": ["", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "", "4/4", "4/5", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "", "", "3/5", "4.5/5", "", "", "", "3/4", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Joe Leydon", "David Nusair", "Duane Byrge", "David Ansen", "Danielle Solzman", "Quentin Curtis", "Richard Schickel", "Jeff Shannon", "John Ferguson", "Steven Rea", "Gary Thompson", "Leah Rozen", "Candice Russell", "Jay Boyar", "Kenneth Turan", "Terrence Rafferty", "", "David Sterritt", "Stephen Hunter", "Gene Siskel"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Moving Picture Show", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Solzy at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent on Sunday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune"], "date": ["October 26, 2020", "January 16, 2019", "May 8, 2018", "February 19, 2018", "February 19, 2018", "December 7, 2017", "August 2, 2013", "August 2, 2013", "August 2, 2013", "August 2, 2013", "August 2, 2013", "August 2, 2013", "August 2, 2013", "August 2, 2013", "August 2, 2013", "August 2, 2013", "August 2, 2013", "August 2, 2013", "August 2, 2013", "August 2, 2013"]}}
