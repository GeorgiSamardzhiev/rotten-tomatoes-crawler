The action, and pacing of the film, very well-done. When things ramp up, they ramp up fast, but even in the dull moments, there's something bubbling.", "What Gunn and Snyder manage to do, above all else, is make zombies terrifying again.", "Zack Snyder is less concerned with themes and more concerned with theatrics.", "It is ferocious and young and exciting.", "A memorable film for fans of the genre. [Full review in Spanish]", "a pretty solid horror flick", "There are scares aplenty in Dawn of the Dead; enjoy them and be well. Twenty years from now, though, I know which version I'll still be watching.", "One of the genre's best pure zombie-fest films featuring regular folks against an army of the undead.", "Nicely respectful of the original film, this remake amps up the adrenalin-charged action while skimping on the depth to deliver a gripping but empty-headed thrill-ride.", "The new version has its share of disturbing moments, but writer James Gunn and director Zack Snyder have stripped away the social satire of the original and put little in its place.", "Extremely gory horror movie; not for kids.", "Will surely appeal to the easily pleased fraction of horror audiences...", "Director Zack Snyder and writer James Gunn have simply traded one set of time-sensitive issues for more contemporary cliches.", "The new version of George A Romero's 1979 zombie movie arrives with all the expected technical improvements but abandons the satire that made Romero's film a masterpiece of the genre.", "Snyder's style is assaultive, and there's little pleasure to the scares.", "The remake of Dawn of the Dead is a fun, gory ride, that makes up for its lack of depth with all out action.", "This oddly effective 'reimagining' loses some of the satire but none of the bite of the 1978 George Romero classic."], "rating": ["", "", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "", "", "", "3.5/5", "B-", "1", "", "", "2/5", "", "2/4", "", "2/5", "3.5/4", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Sr. Rose Pacatte", "A.S.
