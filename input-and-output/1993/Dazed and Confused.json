{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This coming-of-age film follows the mayhem of group of rowdy teenagers in Austin, Texas, celebrating the last day of high school in 1976. The graduating class heads for a popular pool hall and joins an impromptu keg party, however star football player Randall \"Pink\" Floyd (Jason London) has promised to focus on the championship game and abstain from partying. Meanwhile, the incoming freshmen try to avoid being hazed by the seniors, most notably the sadistic bully Fred O'Bannion (Ben Affleck).", "rating": "92", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Richard Linklater", "studio": "AlphavilleFilms,DetourFilmproduction", "theater_date": "Sep 10, 1993", "dvd_date": "Aug 24, 2015", "box_office": "$8.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The magnum opus of Linklater's Austin films, but in this slice of life it's high schoolers moving up and moving on.", "It's never going to be this good again.", "Totally authentic.

The '70s kids AMERICAN GRAFFITI.", "Richard Linklater manages to entertain with a film that's really about nothing, yet truly works as a snapshot of a certain moment in time. [Full review in Spanish]", "Few of these people are going anywhere, but they are not going anywhere with style and dignity.", "It is a nostalgia film and a coming-of-age film. In some ways, it is every Bildungsroman and in some ways, it is like no other.", "Very little actually happens but - like life - it's not always the events that define a time but the characters in it. And ''Dazed and Confused'' is bursting with wonderfully drawn and completely credible characters.", "Watching this documentary-style picture is like being clean and sober at some endless '70s party where everyone else is drunk or stoned.", "Richard Linklater's cinematic flashback Dazed and Confused captures a rich pageant of high-school life, circa 1976, in a mere 100 minutes, leaning on nostalgia without wallowing in it.", "Manages to not only unfold in to a fun narrative, but also builds a myriad fascinating characters you'll either love or hate...", "glorifies bullying and tries to balance it with pseudo-intellectual contemplation", "Has the look and spirit of the time down pat. Unfortunately it captures only the worst of the typical misogynistic, foul mouthed druggie losers of the period.", "The film transcends the common barriers and becomes a living spiritual entity, encompassing the essence and tone of an era.", "It may have seemed like a movie that was out of time, but it turned out to be perfectly in sync with the restlessness of the early 90s as well.", "Like the moustache sported by Matthew McCounaughey's character, Dazed And Confused is sleazy, amusing and quite, quite awesome.", "The teenage wasteland, 1976-style, of Dazed and Confused is smack-dab between The Brady Bunch and Children of the Damned , and it's a scary, if sometimes giddily amusing, place to visit.", "Bet it makes you wanna dance.", "Despite some gags which use the benefit of hindsight too much for their own good, this is a smart piece of filmmaking which suggests Linklater is already one of the more formidable talents of the 90s.", "Plenty of drug use with very little consequence.", "Seriously funny, and shorn of any hint of nostalgia or wish-fulfilment, this is pretty much where it's at."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "A", "5/5", "3.5/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "1/5", "C", "9/10", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tom Meek", "Brent McKnight", "Patrick McDonald", "Fico Cangiano", "Ben Thompson", "Bedatri D.
