However, Dorothea is already entangled with a secret lesbian lover, Anne (Lisa Chappell). Dorothea, Lawrence and Anne try to conceal their passions, but the charade can only last so long.", "rating": "40", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Peter Wells, Stewart Main", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It passes the giggle test as a splendidly opulent parody of period trysts.", "WIld, stylish historical melodrama shows a genuinely experimental approach to filmmaking.", "", "", ""], "rating": ["B", "", "2/5", "2/4", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Dennis Schwartz", "Michael E.
