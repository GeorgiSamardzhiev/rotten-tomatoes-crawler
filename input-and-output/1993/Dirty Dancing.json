{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Baby (Jennifer Grey) is one listless summer away from the Peace Corps. Hoping to enjoy her youth while it lasts, she's disappointed when her summer plans deposit her at a sleepy resort in the Catskills with her parents. Her luck turns around, however, when the resort's dance instructor, Johnny (Patrick Swayze), enlists Baby as his new partner, and the two fall in love. Baby's father forbids her from seeing Johnny, but she's determined to help him perform the last big dance of the summer.", "rating": "68", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts/Romance", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Emile Ardolino", "studio": "VestronPictures", "theater_date": "Aug 25, 1987", "dvd_date": "Dec 17, 2015", "box_office": "$486.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The film exists in the main for a handful of seductively lit and framed dance sequences that aestheticise Jennifer Grey and Patrick Swayze's bodies and physical chemistry.", "A great coming of age story that takes on deeper themes than given credit for with great chemistry between the leads", "Dirty Dancing is dull and charmless. The initial curiosity turns into disappointment and the only memorable aspect is the effort of the protagonist Jennifer Grey. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Dirty Dancing, directed by Emile Ardolino, is a conventional film in its Borscht Belt setting, ethnic satire, and feel-good ending, but with a deliciously subversive core.", "I'm just glad it was an hour-and-a-half. I can see why it was a hit, but this is just all kinds of boring.", "There was no chemistry, the story was \"blah.\"", "Between the great soundtrack, the physical appeal of the very approachable Grey and smoking hot Swayze, the undeniable chemistry between the leads and the toe-tapping dance numbers, Dirty Dancing is inherently watchable.", "I like it much better than any of the Molly Ringwald coming of age comedies from the 80s.", "Dirty Dancing may just be one of the most seminal garbage movies ever. But, garbage it is.", "Packs in drama, comedy, and an iconic finale that's still quite riveting.", "It's a sweet, lyrical movie with plenty of musical nostalgia. But more importantly, Dirty Dancing has an uplifting message of hope that can be found only in the dreams of the young.", "It's a movie best seen through the hazy amber filter of '80s nostalgia, and if you're watching it without those rose-colored glasses on, God help you.", "I loved this movie. It seems to dream itself, as it tells the story of a young girl who comes alive in the summer of 1963.", "What seems an enjoyable piece of fluff about a summer camp romance is, in its own quiet way, a powerful morality tale.", "These are not characters, but objects of choreography used to push a thoughtless agenda of sound and movement.", "The dancing here brings out the sensual dreaminess of the songs. Dirty Dancing -- what a great title! -- is such a bubbleheaded, retro vision of growing up in the sixties (or any other time) that you go out of the theatre giggling happily.", "If the ending of Eleanor Bergstein's script is too neat and inspirational, the rough energy of the film's song and dance does carry one along, past the whispered doubts of better judgment.", "While it's easy to be cynical about the whole affair, the film's sheer audacity is admirable, and Dirty Dancing knows what it aspires to.", "Although the plot is sometimes implausible, the movie's music, dancing and romantic spirit carry a lot of it. In addition, Dirty Dancing has the virtues of a female main character (a bit unusual in a coming-of-age movie) and an interesting setting.", "There is some freshness in the film, much of it supplied by Jennifer Grey, who's appealing, thoughtful and just right as Baby. There's also some eloquence, although most of it is supplied by the wonderful vintage pop songs."], "rating": ["2/5", "9/10", "", "", "2/5", "1/5", "", "9/10", "2/5", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "1/4", "", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["PJ Nabarro", "Rachel Wagner", "\u00c1ngel Luis Inurria", "Molly Haskell", "Brandon Collins", "Justin Brown", "Jennifer Lind-Westbrook", "Rachel Wagner", "Christopher Lloyd", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Cathy Burke", "Jason Bailey", "Chris Chase", "Sarah Crompton", "David Keyes", "Pauline Kael", "Richard Schickel", "", "Jay Boyar", "Ben Yagoda"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rachel&#39;s Reviews (YouTube)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Vogue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Medium Popcorn", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Medium Popcorn", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Culturess", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Yap", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">United Press International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flavorwire", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaphile.org", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News"], "date": ["August 8, 2020", "June 19, 2020", "April 1, 2020", "February 28, 2020", "October 12, 2019", "October 12, 2019", "July 4, 2019", "February 28, 2019", "October 10, 2018", "January 20, 2017", "October 9, 2016", "May 27, 2016", "August 20, 2015", "December 18, 2014", "September 20, 2014", "May 6, 2013", "March 25, 2013", "March 25, 2013", "March 25, 2013", "March 25, 2013"]}}
