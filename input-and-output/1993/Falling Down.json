{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A middle-aged man dealing with both unemployment and divorce, William Foster (Michael Douglas) is having a bad day. When his car breaks down on a Los Angeles highway, he leaves his vehicle and begins a trek across the city to attend his daughter's birthday party. As he makes his way through the urban landscape, William's frustration and bitterness become more evident, resulting in violent encounters with various people, including a vengeful gang and a dutiful veteran cop (Robert Duvall).", "rating": "73", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Joel Schumacher", "studio": "RegencyEnterprises,WarnerBros.,LeStudioCanal+,AlcorFilms", "theater_date": "Feb 26, 1993", "dvd_date": "May 1, 2008", "box_office": "$40.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Falling Down,\" a stellar film, is Joel Schumacher's miracle.", "Disturbing '90s crime thriller has violence and language.", "This is probably Schumacher's most accomplished work besides Tigerland and, interestingly, shot in L.A. around the time of the riots.", "Even decades later, It is still as a very actual film. [Full Review in Spanish]", "It's a somewhat high-concept premise that's employed to consistently engrossing effect by filmmaker Schumacher...", "We cannot make out if we are meant to like him or not, or why he is so angry, and this is intriguing.", "Director Joel Schumacher, credited with toning down Ebbe Roe Smith's script, paces the film rivetingly, which goes to show that good film-making doesn't guarantee a good film. Falling Down is as sleek and efficient as a torture chamber.", "These adventures would be offensive if you could take them seriously, so it's probably good that you can't.", "None of the characters ever rises beyond the level of his or her generic functions, and by the end the overall emptiness of the conception becomes fully apparent.", "What makes this an innovative film is Joel Schumacher's bold eschewing of the good-guy-verses-bad-guy Hollywood convention.", "Let's face it, there is an element of truth in the character of D-FENS. But it is, finally, tabloid truth.", "The character of William Foster (simply called D-Fens in the closing credits) represents an element of our collective id.", "Atrociously written by actor Ebbe Roe Smith and atrociously directed (it goes without saying) by Joel Schumacher...", "A heavy-handed potboiler, but as it raises the temperature, it does give cause to consider the line--so easily crossed--between social function and disasterous personal undoing. [Blu-ray]", "...holds up pretty well today, even if its tone meanders all over the place.", "At first comes across like a mean-spirited black comedy and then snowballs into a reasonably powerful portrait of social alienation. The tone is unremittingly dour, however.", "A real artist could make something incisive or darkly hilarious out of this moral tightrope act. Schumacher, veering recklessly between social satire, kick-ass fantasy and damsel-in-distress melodrama, plays the game for opportunistic cheap thrills.", "Maybe Michael Douglas' best work, he as the depressed man driven to madness.", "Joel Schumacher's best film.", "A crude, cathartic rant that both condemns and exploits modern paranoia."], "rating": ["4.0/4", "2/5", "3/4", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "3/5", "1/4", "3/4", "6/10", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Barbara Shulgasser", "Tom Meek", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "David Nusair", "Mark Amory", "Quentin Curtis", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "", "Richard Schickel", "Kevin Carr", "Walter Chaw", "Peter Canavese", "John J.
