And it is utterly sincere without being treacly or preachy.", "Fracassa como exemplar de artes marciais e, o que \u00e9 ainda pior, como homenagem a um homem que inspirou grandes atletas e atores (incluindo o protagonista desta produ\u00e7\u00e3o).", "As energetically corporeal as it is touchingly spiritual.", "", "Li carries the load on his shifty shoulders in a nostalgic wushu period piece that is philosophically solemn yet kinetically impish in its reflective spirit.", "Fearless has some of the best choreography I've seen in years, and Li handles the task with his usual finesse.", "The film is about more than complex stunts and breathtaking acrobatics. It's about a man who learns the pitfalls of pride and becomes a national hero in the process. And it's a good time at the movies.", "It's a treat for fans of historical martial arts epics and especially for fans of Jet Li, who won't be the ones to tell the star if he's starting to show his age.", "If Li must leave his signature genre, better this entertaining bit of history than the wall-to-wall boredom of Hero.", "The martial arts master's final epic is great when the fists and feet are flying.", "Do you really mean it, Jet Li?"], "rating": ["", "B", "7/10", "3/5", "", "3/5", "3.5/5", "3/4", "2/4", "", "2/5", "", "3/4", "2.5/4", "3.5/5", "3/4", "", "3/4", "6.5/10", "3/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Alberto Abu\u00edn", "Owen Gleiberman", "Joshua Starnes", "Liz Perle", "Fernando F.
