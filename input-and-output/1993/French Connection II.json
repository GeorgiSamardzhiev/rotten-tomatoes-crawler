When Charnier's goons force him into a heroin addiction, the tough cop must summon every ounce of his courage to kick the habit cold turkey.", "rating": "76", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "John Frankenheimer", "studio": "TwentiethCenturyFox", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The whole film is essentially one long chase, separated by constant disagreements and politics between nationalities.", "I believe that The French Connection II is all about the slow-burn chase.
