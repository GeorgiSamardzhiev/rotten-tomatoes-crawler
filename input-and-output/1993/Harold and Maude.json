Harold's fake suicides are a pale defiance and reflection of his cloistered, sapped life. The vital counterculture (Maude) helps Harold avoid the army.", "This darkly humorous ,romantic comedy between an introvert adolescent and and old spunky woman, is playing it too safe to be considered truly anti-establishment, but it became a cult picture.", "A classic of dark comedy.", "If there's one comedy to represent the woof and warp of the early '70s, \"Harold and Maude\" is it.", "", "A doggedly eccentric film which some will reject out of hand. Others will find it profundly moving and life affirming.", "Simpleminded, but it's fairly inoffensive, at least until Ashby lingers over the concentration-camp serial number tattooed on Gordon's arm. Some things are beyond the reach of whimsy.", "It is most successful when it keeps to the tone of an insane fairystory set up at the beginning of the movie.", "weird, very very weird", "", "", "It's not quite a romance, not quite a buddy picture. It is, however, one of the '70s quirkiest comedies, and its bleak morbidity is uncommonly matched by its over-the-top hilarity.", "[Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon] both are so aggressive, so creepy and off-putting.", "", "The epitome of a film that you can't believe you're laughing at, but you are.
