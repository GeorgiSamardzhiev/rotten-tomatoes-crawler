{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Sexual deviant Frank (Sean Chapman) inadvertently opens a portal to hell when he tinkers with a box he bought while abroad. The act unleashes gruesome beings called Cenobites, who tear Frank's body apart. When Frank's brother (Andrew Robinson) and his wife, Julia (Clare Higgins), move into Frank's old house, they accidentally bring what is left of Frank back to life. Frank then convinces Julia, his one-time lover, to lure men back to the house so he can use their blood to reconstruct himself.", "rating": "72", "genre": "Horror", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Clive Barker", "studio": "RivdelFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 25, 2016", "box_office": "$13.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's gross! It's unenjoyable! And I can't stop thinking about it!", "One of the most original and unequaled horror films of the decade.", "More than with terror, the movie plays with revulsion. And that is its (relative) novelty. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The reason the movie works as well as it does is because of its human characters.", "Arriving in a decade in which most movie monsters were monotonous slashers, the Cenobites were truly exciting, original, and unsettling characters.", "Part of the film's excellence comes out of its taboo-ness, depicting everything from abusive love to the sometimes dangerous links between sex and death, pain and pleasure.", "Rightly considered a horror classic for pushing boundaries around sex and horror, Hellraiser is a flawed film with forgettable characters and gaping plot holes in the second act.", "Horror is at its best when it's relentless. Clive Barker knows this, and his debut feature as director is so gleefully vicious, so relentlessly grim that it's going to be very hard for fans of the genre not to like it.", "With Hellraiser, Clive Barker created one of the most genuinely disturbing movies of the last 20 years.", "The film is for the most part a return to the cutting edge of horror cinema, and in its inventively gruesome moments a reminder of the Grand Guignol intensity that has recently tended to disintegrate into lazy splatter", "Utterly bizarre and entirely ridiculous - and yet effective, an imaginative guignol festival, like the goriest of soap operas, in which one wrong move opens a portal to hell.", "Some of the FX haven't aged well, and nine more Hellraiser movies flayed the franchise, but this is a key '80s horror.", "There are some intriguing special effects in the movie, but a limp script and unconvincing performances don't help. Worse of all, it isn't scary. I only jumped once during the entire film.", "\"This isn&#146;t for your eyes&#148;\", says the demonic Cenobite &#150;- but he is so very wrong about Clive Barker'&#146;s must-see horror.", "Not only did it revolutionise horror and force mainstream critics to accept that it could ... have real artistic weight, it captured a moment in time when social and sexual mores were shifting in a fascinating way.", "For all that it is an incredible, and incredibly disturbing, film to look at, Hellraiser doesn't entirely click as a narrative.", "Gore-torture-horror-ghoul fantasy from the '80s.", "Sharp grim direction and tight writing from Clive Barker who turns his story of a puzzle box invoking the forces of hell in to an experience rather than doing the work for us...", "Clive Barker's virtuosic De Sadean satire", "Barker's vision cribs equally from the mythos of vampires and zombies, but Hellraiser's overriding ridiculousness (and nagging budgetary shortcomings) can't disguise the fact that the movie is at least unwittingly a product of the AIDS crisis."], "rating": ["", "9/10", "", "B+", "3/4", "5/5", "", "4/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "4/5", "2.5/5", "", "4/5", "7/10", "2/5", "", "", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Chris Plante", "Mike Massie", "\u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez-Santos", "Chris Stuckmann", "Matt Brunson", "C.H.
