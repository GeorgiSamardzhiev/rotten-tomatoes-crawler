{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Schatze Page, Loco Dempsey and Pola Debevoise (Lauren Bacall, Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe) are three women on a mission: They all want to marry a millionaire. To accomplish this task, they move into a fancy New York City apartment and begin courting the city's elite. They have no problem meeting rich men, but unfortunately most of them turn out to be creeps or cons. Eventually they must decide: Is a life of luxury more important to them than finding true love?", "rating": "84", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Jean Negulesco", "studio": "TwentiethCenturyFox", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A rather rambling but entertaining comedy, effectively filmed in the wide-screen CinemaScope process.", "In How to Marry a Millionaire, directed by John Negulesco, there is the triple delight of Marilyn Monroe, Betty Grable and Lauren Bacall in one movie -- and one apartment.", "The stars save this 1953 entry, through fruitful collision if not smooth collaboration.", "Fabulously cast and wickedly witty.", "The CinemaScope process was well used here, with panoramic shots of Manhattan accompanied by Newman's entire orchestra performing his composition Street Scene in prolog and epilog shots.", "Classic Hollywood legends sparkle; premise doesn't hold up.", "Despite some good work from Bacall and Monroe, this comedy ends up feeling flat.
