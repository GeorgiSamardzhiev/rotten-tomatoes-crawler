But the beauty of this film is far more than skin deep.", "If this film were a cake it would be a grand one -- rich, sumptuous, oh-so-filling and with numerous tiers.", "Howard's End unfolds at a deliberate, measure pace, and it always feels like so much is happening that Ivory will scarcely be able to contain it all.", "It is an intelligent movie, a good movie, about real and not fake issues. And it moves the heart.", "[Howards End] is an ever-pertinent, wondrous and welcome return to the big screen.", "A more troubling and rigorous inquest into a bygone era than usual.", "Deeply romantic, political, emotion-led, respectful of music and literature, impeccably dressed and, in one of the characters' own words, \"overexpressive\".", "In its own severe and occasionally stolid way, Howards End offers real passion.", "The high watermark of Merchant Ivory film-making.", "One of the best Merchant Ivory productions and one of the finest adaptations of an EM Forster novel.", "Choice performances from Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson, but any social criticism is weakened by the veneration of the privileged milieu.", "Merchant Ivory were famous for producing some of cinema's most lavish period dramas, and Howards End is perhaps the culmination of their craft.", "A can't-miss opportunity to experience some of the finest filmmaking of the 20th century.", "Jhabvala's Oscar-winning script deftly juggles the characters' romantic and financial travails, and Ivory's delicate direction manages to cut to the emotional core.", "What sets \"Howards End\" apart is the complex emotional life of its characters.", "An elegant, if bland reworking of Forster's classic 1910 novel.", "Thompson, radiating intelligence, shines as a woman who marries in desperation and repents at leisure.", "Elegant and powerful, accommodating collisions of class and temperament with the grace of a perfect Edwardian hostess, Howards End is the work to which all Merchant Ivory's other films have pointed and aspired."], "rating": ["2.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "5/5", "4/5", "5/5", "5/5", "3/5", "", "4/4", "4/4", "", "3.5/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Josh Larsen", "Nicholas Bell", "Jeff Menell", "Charlotte Harrison", "Andrew Parker", "Noel Annan", "Matthew Anderson", "Lizzie Francke", "Simran Hans", "Peter Bradshaw", "Kevin Maher", "Allan Hunter", "Tom Dawson", "Austin Trunick", "Barry Hertz", "Sean P.
