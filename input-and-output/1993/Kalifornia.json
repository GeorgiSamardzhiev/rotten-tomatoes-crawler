{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Brian Kessler (David Duchovny) is a writer, and his girlfriend, Carrie Laughlin (Michelle Forbes), is a photographer. They're working on a book about serial killers, and planning a trip across the country to document the sites of famous serial murders.

Where the film suffers is in its obliviousness toward its own obviousness.", "Parts of it seem intent on being a thriller, while others are played as though the story is a dark comedy. Consequently, you aren't always sure whether to laugh or tense up.", "If you hop aboard this sick, unjoyful ride, you'd better bail out early. Unsafe at any speed, this dramatic vehicle goes up in flames.", "The movie is a road trip that takes a bad turn to hell.
