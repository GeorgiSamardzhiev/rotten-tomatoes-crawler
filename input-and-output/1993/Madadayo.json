We are fortunate to have the cinematic legacy he left.", "A sweetly overlong portrayal of an interconnected community whose center is a beloved professor.", "Sad and agonizing, it nonetheless allows Kurosawa to demonstrate his uniquely optimistic view of the world.", "This warm, celebratory and very public film is punctuated by sudden and luminous private visualizations.", "Beautiful and funny.", "A masterly work, with Kurosawa, then 83, still capable of surprising an audience and creating indelible images.", "It's not one of Kurosawa's great films; the compass of feeling is, in the end, too narrow, the scope of human reference too restricted. But it is, within its own proportions, nearly perfect.", "This is the kind of film we would all like to make, if we were very old and very serene.
