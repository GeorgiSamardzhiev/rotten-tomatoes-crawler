But then Sorkin's sharp, smart dialogue gives them a lot to work with.", "There can't have been much aforethought to Malice, Harold Becker's preposterous new thriller.", "...a superior thriller that does, more than 20 years later, remain one of the best examples of the genre.", "The fun of Malice comes from Sorkin, Frank, and Harold Becker understanding the been-there/done-that formulas of thrillers past and tinkering with them as much as possible.", "As easy to take as a college course in basket-weaving.", "", "", "", "Click to read review"], "rating": ["5/10", "", "", "C-", "", "2/4", "", "B", "4/5", "2/5", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "4/5", "B", "3/5", "2/5", "4/5", "0/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Tom Huddleston", "Peter Travers", "Owen Gleiberman", "Chris Hicks", "Roger Ebert", "Vincent Canby", "Robert Roten", "Greg Muskewitz", "Marjorie Baumgarten", "Almar Haflidason", "Malcolm Johnson", "Quentin Curtis", "David Nusair", "Scott Tobias", "Dennis Schwartz", "Michael Szymanski", "Emanuel Levy", "Jeremy C.
