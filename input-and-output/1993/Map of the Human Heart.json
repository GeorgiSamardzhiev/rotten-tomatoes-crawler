{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In an Arctic village in 1931, British mapmaker Walter Russell (Patrick Bergin) selects 12-year-old Eskimo Avik (Robert Joamie) as his guide.

A decade later, a grown Avik (Jason Scott Lee) encounters Albertine (Anne Parillaud) again in London, where he's serving as a British combat pilot.
