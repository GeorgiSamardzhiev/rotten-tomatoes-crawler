[Full Review in Spanish]", "I have often hoped that the arts could be wonderfully useful in times of trouble. I have seen few examples of that. Nashville, however, fulfills my dream. It is a spiritual inventory of America, splendidly frank and honest.", "This cinema verite approach to a fictional work creates the illusion that Nashville is a far more perceptive film than it really is.", "Works of popular art are rarely so pertinent as to make viewers rethink their own lives. Seen today, Nashville fills in the intellectual, spiritual, and political chasm caused by Hollywood's juvenile Millennial escapism.", "Altman offers up a sprawling mosaic of American society: we're given impressionistic glimpses of individual lives, moments of intimacy within the babble of everyday existence.", "Altman's great kaleidoscopic ensemble comedy-drama about a frenzied few days in country music's capital, with an unlikely, quirky, explosive crowd of musicians, hangers-on and politicos all converging on a fateful concert crossroads.", "Politics and art collide in Altman's dense tapestry, showing that part of American's beguiling promise is the inevitability of commodification.", "Robert Altman's Nashville, one of the best films of the 1970s, is a divisive, inarguably indulgent film, but also one uniquely experimental and prophetic.", "Compared with the carbonated, artificially-flavoured, genetically-modified pap that mainstream cinema dishes up, Robert Altman's Nashville now tastes like a crisp organic apple.", "To ponder Robert Altman's Nashville is not merely to examine a profoundly important movie, but to deal with the very birth of a filmic ideal.", "Since the protagonists are mostly the performers themselves, and since, by and large, they seemed to me to be nothing but slick hillbilly narcissists, I found it difficult to become interested in their various plights.", "Nashville is boisterous, good-natured, funny, exciting and brutal; it will exhaust you and you will feel rewarded.", "Sharp '70s satire has nudity, cursing, mature themes.", "The funniest epic vision of America ever to reach the screen.", "Certainly, for the American cinema, it is the most epochal event since Orson Welles' Citizen Kane.", "Some characters are odious while others are sympathetic, but every last one manages to provide contrast and depth to Altman's view of an America in which the boundaries between politics and entertainment are all but nonexistent."], "rating": ["", "3/10", "", "", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "4/4", "9/10", "5/5", "5/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Mike Massie", "John Simon", "Kyle Smith", "Alonso D\u00edaz de la Vega", "Kurt Vonnegut", "Jacoba Atlas", "Armond White", "Tom Dawson", "Michael Wilmington", "John Oursler", "Stuart Galbraith", "Peter Bradshaw", "David Keyes", "Robert Mazzocco", "Robert Hatch", "Andrea Beach", "Pauline Kael", "Arthur Knight", "Matt Brunson"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Esquire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">National Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Universal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Vogue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Free Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">National Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The List", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">PopMatters", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">DVDTalk.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaphile.org", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New York Review of Books", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Nation", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing"], "date": ["February 12, 2021", "August 30, 2020", "August 4, 2020", "July 23, 2020", "May 8, 2020", "February 27, 2020", "November 27, 2019", "September 19, 2019", "April 24, 2019", "February 5, 2019", "November 20, 2018", "November 20, 2018", "November 20, 2018", "June 10, 2018", "April 4, 2018", "January 30, 2018", "October 4, 2016", "April 7, 2016", "July 6, 2015", "April 18, 2014"]}}
