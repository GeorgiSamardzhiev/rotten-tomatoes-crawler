{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this anime film, Jubei, a highly skilled ninja, is coerced into slaying his own clan of warriors. After begrudgingly killing his fellow swordsmen, he becomes a roving hired assassin. During his travels, he must face off against an organization of demonic ninjas known as the Devils of Kimon, who are plotting to take power of Japan's government. The Devils will stop at nothing, and have the power to annihilate entire villages. Now, only Jubei and a shogun spy named Dakuan can stop them.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Animation/Anime & Manga", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Yoshiaki Kawajiri", "studio": "MadhouseEntertainment,TohoCompanyLtd.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 3, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A genuinely great piece of animation, one of the medium's greatest achievements in the 1990s in any country.", "Ninja Scroll is a champion of anime and belongs in the upper echelons of its history.", "For fans of Japanese animation at its most colorful, stylized, and ultraviolent, the film delivers the goods.", "No-nonsense quest movie is chock-full of bloody slice-and-dice action, suitably grotesque villains and life-and-death confrontations.", "What dazzles most is the contrast between the beautifully rendered, pastoral backdrops of crags, waterfalls, forests, and temples, and the gruesome, stylized violence that takes place against them.", "For those seeking the best ninja/samurai action on screen, there are dozens of live action movies either directed by Akira Kurosawa or based on manga by Kazuo Koike that are much better films than Ninja Scroll.", "A wandering ronin takes on a posse of supernatural ninjas in a whipcracking race that never lets reality get in the way of a hearty bout of blood-lettting.", "Its baroque sadism and sexism hasn't aged well, but it still packs a visceral kick.", "There is so much going on here, that the film's total lack of subtext - or, more generously, its pure escapism - only sinks in afterwards.
