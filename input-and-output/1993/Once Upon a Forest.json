{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this animated tale, a toxic spill from an encroaching construction site threatens the life of a badger (Elizabeth Moss), so three woodland creatures -- wood mouse Abigail (Ellen Blain), mole Edgar (Ben Gregory) and hedgehog Russell (Paige Gosney) -- must brave a treacherous journey to find a cure. As the threat of the destructive humans looms ever closer, the animals are in a race against time as their remaining family and friends struggle to survive in the face of disaster.", "rating": "22", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Animation/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 20m", "director": "Charles Grosvenor, David Michener", "studio": "Hanna-BarberaProductions,HarlechTelevision", "theater_date": "Jun 18, 1993", "dvd_date": "May 23, 2016", "box_office": "$6.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A pleasing, sweet primer in caring for our flora and fauna.", "For all the feeling the drawing instills in the figures, it might be termed inanimation.", "It's a good thing this breezy animated adventure lasts only slightly more than 70 minutes. Children will no doubt enjoy its simple tale, but would probably grow restless if it went on for a minute longer.", "Respect for nature and the environment is a message that no one would quarrel with, but this is yet another example of a movie that can't or won't differentiate between technology and the use to which it is put.", "The characters are not memorable; the songs are lame and the drawing style is pedestrian.", "From the first moments of Once Upon a Forest, there is evidence of high artistic standards. The backgrounds are beautifully detailed, right down to the shading and contours of a tree trunk.", "Sadly, in common with so many non-Disney cartoons, the standard of the songs is poor and the animation lacks magic.", "While the movie's lip-synchronization leaves much to be desired, the creatures great and small are nicely conceived, the settings a vivid eyeful and the ecology lesson sound.", "It contains a dire message: Man is destroying nature and progress is evil. It is hard to know what small children, the film's intended audience, are supposed to do with this idea. Nag their parents about recycling? Work it out in nightmares?", "Sounds good in practice but with a plot where very little happens and songs that really shouldn't have been included, sticking the kids in front of David Attenborough sounds much more appealing.", "Even at its preachiest, the circus-bright colors and bouncy songs keep the sermonizing and the saccharine content under control.", "The film rarely gets past familiar gimmicks of the cartoon-adventure genre, and the animation isn't very inspired.", "While an agreeable enough effort in most respects, pic is a bit dark and somber to be terrifically appealing to kids, and could have used bigger doses of humor and music.", "Makes one long for animals whacking each other with sticks of dynamite.", "", "In this likable fable about growing up, learning teamwork and developing courage, three small creatures who dwell in Dapplewood, an idyllic forest, go on a far-flung quest for healing herbs to save the life of a dying friend.", "", "Once Upon a Forest has a good heart -- I liked the way it treated its themes -- but the movie is kind of dumb.", "On its own terms, the fairy tale sensibility works perfectly in context -- and the film is most enjoyable for children and their parents.", "There is nothing really engaging about this latest effort from the creator of An American Tale and Hanna-Barbera."], "rating": ["", "", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "1/4", "3.5/4", "2/5", "", "2/4", "1/5", "3/4", "", "", "", "2/5", "", "2/5", "2.5/4", "", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Malcolm Johnson", "Quentin Curtis", "Jeff Shannon", "Desmond Ryan", "Gene Siskel", "Candice Russell", "David Parkinson", "", "Johanna Steinmetz", "Kim Newman", "", "David Sterritt", "Todd McCarthy", "Mark Kermode", "Emanuel Levy", "Stephen Holden", "Scott Weinberg", "Roger Ebert", "Chris Hicks", "Hollis Chacona"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent on Sunday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Sun-Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Deseret News (Salt Lake City)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Austin Chronicle"], "date": ["June 6, 2018", "December 7, 2017", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "March 26, 2009", "January 26, 2006", "October 13, 2005", "August 30, 2004", "July 27, 2002", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000"]}}
