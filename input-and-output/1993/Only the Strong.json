{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Louis Stevens' (Mark Dacascos) service as a member of an elite military unit kept him out of the country for several years. Now that he's back home in Florida, he's dismayed at what's become of his old high school. He sees that drug dealers, dispatched by local overlord Silverio (Paco Christian Prieto), sell on school grounds with little fear of getting caught. A skilled martial artist, Louis is determined to end the drug peddling, but to do so he'll probably have to duke it out with Silverio.", "rating": "8", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "Sheldon Lettich", "studio": "DavisFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$2.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It wraps up neatly with a touch of silliness, but, ultimately, as an action-packed demonstration of capoeira, this film is wholly proficient.", "Solved: the problem of impoverished, understaffed, crime-ridden, drug- infested inner city schools.

But that is not enough to make Only the Strong more than a passing fancy destined for cable TV.", "Only the simple-minded will find much to cheer in this martial arts actioner, which has the queasy feel of a movie slapped together by the marketing department.", "A paean to the Brazilian martial art of capoeira harks back to those break-dancing quickies.", "", "A movie that exists solely for its fight sequences and to show off its star's muscles and gymnastic grace.", "If only the plot were a little less obvious, the confrontations a little less cliched.", "I expected it to be an obligatory late-summer, mindless, plotless action film. I was wrong. It's a late-summer, mindless, plotless action film with a message.
