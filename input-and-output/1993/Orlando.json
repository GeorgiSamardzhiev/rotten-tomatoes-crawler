{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1600, nobleman Orlando (Tilda Swinton) inherits his parents' house, thanks to Queen Elizabeth I (Quentin Crisp), who commands the young man to never change. After a disastrous affair with Russian princess Sasha (Charlotte Valandrey), Orlando looks for solace in the arts before being appointed ambassador to Constantinople in 1700, where war is raging. One morning, Orlando is shocked to wake up as a woman and returns home, struggling as a female to retain her property as the centuries roll by.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Sally Potter", "studio": "BritishScreenProductions,Rio,AdventurePictures,MikadoFilms,LenfilmStudio,Sigma", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 7, 2013", "box_office": "$5.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Potter's ironies, veering between the blunt and the exquisite, the oblique and the confrontational, expose the cruel hazards of nature and the perversities of culture.", "Few films understand the value of gender as a spectacle better than Orlando.", "With words from Shakespeare and Spenser and music from Jimmy Somerville, this is a kaleidoscopic celebration of Albion. Or an art-house Highlander, if you prefer.", "Despite my misgivings about book-to-film adaptations, Sally Potter's \"Orlando\" impressed the hell out of me. It's opulent, cheeky, and fun as hell. Woolf would be proud.", "The film's wit and layered sense of history seem richer than ever.", "The good news about this historical vaudeville is that Orlando's consciousness, like his/her gender, is a delightful work-in-progress.", "Unlike anything onscreen this month or this year, Orlando is serious, provocative and sometimes funny fare. Novelist Virginia Woolf might well be pleased.", "What it lacks in coherence it makes up for in sheer spectacle.", "Though visually impressive and assured, it is the hollowest of successes, all chic set design, smug posturing and self-satisfied attitude.", "Reminiscent of the low-budget lushness of the early films of Peter Greenaway and Ken Russell, Orlando could turn out to be the art-house smash of the summer.", "Writer-director Sally Potter's film, based on the classic Virginia Woolf novel, is a lyrical history lesson on the nature of sexual politics.", "Credit where credit is due: Potter more or less successfully converted a crazy, overflowing tome into something simple and attractive.", "Potter possesses a natural gracefulness in presentation that helps a little but, finally, not nearly enough. Orlando is vague when she means it to be mysterious, coy when it ought to be witty, familiar when it should be bold.", "Sumptuous and witty book-to-screen treatment for Virginia Woolf's novel, with graceful and ambitious direction by Sally Potter.", "See Orlando for its fabulous costumes, fascinating look at changing eras, and impressive performance by Tilda Swinton. Viewing this film for other reasons will almost certainly lead to a negative impression.", "It wanders from the frozen London of the 1600s to the battlefields of World War I and has fun all the way. You haven't seen anything like it.", "Compared with Potter's bold, beautiful, original, and witty first feature, The Gold Diggers, this is safe, crowd-flattering stuff, the Driving Miss Daisy of art pictures -- a film with practically no ideas at all, but lots of fancy trimmings.", "What it perhaps lacks in content, the film more than makes up for in its stunning design and accesible, humorous approach.", "Written and directed by Sally Potter, Orlando takes a droll approach to subject matter usually attended by the utmost solemnity.", "Sally Potter has made a beautiful, if decidedly wobbly, movie out of Virginia Woolfs novel about a 16th-century nobleman who evolves, across some 400 years, into a modern woman in her mid-30s. Swinton plays both male and female Orlando with cool humor."], "rating": ["", "", "4/5", "", "", "3/4", "", "3/4", "", "3/4", "3/4", "B-", "2/5", "", "2.5/4", "3/4", "", "3/5", "3/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Brody", "Ian Thomas Malone", "Ed Potton", "Lindsay Pugh", "Caryn James", "Carrie Rickey", "Candice Russell", "Johanna Steinmetz", "Kenneth Turan", "John Hartl", "Dennis King", "Matt Prigge", "Jay Boyar", "Adam Roberts", "James Berardinelli", "Stephen Hunter", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Marcus Trower", "Gary Thompson", ""], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Ian Thomas Malone", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Woman in Revolt", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ReelViews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine"], "date": ["November 21, 2020", "May 7, 2020", "March 3, 2020", "October 24, 2018", "February 7, 2018", "March 23, 2015", "March 23, 2015", "March 23, 2015", "March 23, 2015", "March 23, 2015", "March 23, 2015", "March 23, 2015", "March 23, 2015", "March 23, 2015", "March 23, 2015", "March 23, 2015", "March 23, 2015", "March 20, 2015", "March 20, 2015", "March 20, 2015"]}}
