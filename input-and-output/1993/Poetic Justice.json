{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Still grieving after the murder of her boyfriend, hairdresser Justice (Janet Jackson) writes poetry to deal with the pain of her loss.

Along for the ride is Chicago's co-worker, Lucky (Tupac Shakur), to whom Justice grows close after some initial problems.

Respect to a Black romantic drama revered in the community, but I'd rather watch Love & Basketball...", "In short, the movie's pretty much of a mess, as it struggles with big themes but hasn't figured out what to do with them.", "Its ambitious aims are commendable in themselves, but regrettable since they overinflate what might have been a simpler and better film.", "If what you really want to see is a simple love story, this is the picture for you. Simple it is, as in simple-minded.", "After a deceptively funny and offbeat beginning, the movie keeps restarting; each new start shows some promise, and Singleton's talent never really deserts him-but the parts don't come together to create a unified story.", "\"Poetic Justice\" is a disappointment.", "After making a big splash with his first film, Boyz N the Hood, John Singleton lost his way somewhat with this twee, right-on drama.", "Some good performances are balanced out by the film's contrivances and gratuitously foul-mouthed characters.", "\"Poetic Justice\" is thoroughly watchable. The director's script has bite, he is fluid with his camerawork and his eye and ear for details, particularly the details of female life, are superb.", "Nno single performance can hold together this scattered, rambling, pseudo-poetic excursion up the California coastline.", "John Singleton's follow-up to his stunning debut, Boys N the Hood, is a major disappointment--a sophomore jinx.", "Singleton splatters his ambition all over the screen; he mixes up violence, romance, comedy, rage, and - yes - poetry. Yet he barely demonstrates the discipline to shape a scene.", "\"Poetic Justice\" has a lot to commend, but discipline is not high on the list.", "An honorable failure, a flawed attempt to take black film out of the macho gangsta ghetto.", "The two leads are raw but completely intriguing, and Poetic Justice offers a slice of the urban story that we generally don't get to see.", "", "", "", ""], "rating": ["2/5", "2/5", "2/4", "", "", "", "", "2/5", "2/5", "3/4", "", "C-", "C-", "", "", "3.5/5", "3/5", "0/5", "2/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Justin Brown", "Brandon Collins", "Stephen Hunter", "David Sterritt", "People Staff", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Kenneth Turan", "Alan Jones", "Angie Errigo", "Johanna Steinmetz", "Malcolm Johnson", "Emanuel Levy", "Owen Gleiberman", "Leonard Klady", "Derek Adams", "Scott Weinberg", "Caffeinated Clint", "Thomas Delapa", "Mark Palermo", "Greg Muskewitz"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Medium Popcorn", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Medium Popcorn", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">DVD Clinic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boulder Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Coast (Halifax, Nova Scotia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com"], "date": ["March 5, 2020", "March 5, 2020", "April 26, 2019", "April 26, 2019", "April 26, 2019", "April 26, 2019", "April 26, 2019", "April 26, 2019", "April 26, 2019", "April 26, 2019", "March 4, 2019", "April 28, 2012", "September 7, 2011", "July 22, 2008", "February 9, 2006", "December 21, 2005", "May 6, 2005", "May 27, 2004", "March 4, 2004", "February 21, 2004"]}}
