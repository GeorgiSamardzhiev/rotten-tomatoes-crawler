{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When charismatic vagrant Whiley Pritcher (Ron Marquette) arrives at a small, sleepy town, he promptly starts a disturbing public access television program. The show, \"Our Town,\" becomes an explosively popular hit and a piercing investigative platform for locals to air their grievances about life in their deceptively idyllic community.
