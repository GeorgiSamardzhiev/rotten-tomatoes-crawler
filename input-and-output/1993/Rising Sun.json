{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When a prostitute is found dead in a Los Angeles skyscraper occupied by a large Japanese corporation, detectives John Conner (Sean Connery) and Web Smith (Wesley Snipes) are called in to investigate. Although Conner has previous experience working in Japan, cultural differences make their progress difficult until a security disc showing the murder turns up. Close scrutiny proves the disc has been doctored, and the detectives realize they're dealing with a cover-up as well.", "rating": "33", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 9m", "director": "Philip Kaufman", "studio": "TwentiethCenturyFox,Walrus&amp;Associates", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 7, 2016", "box_office": "$62.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There are moments when Rising Sun touches a raw nerve...Too often though, this film conveys what might be called the unbearable lightness of Crichton.", "A major disappointment from first-class director Philip Kaufman.", "It turns out a muddle: a buddy pic and a culture shocker as well as a thriller.", "", "It never rises past a second-rate thriller.", "Kaufman's film is flawed. but not as bad as critics claim-- charges of racism made this adaptation controversial even before it was seen.", "It would be nice to see Connery doing something intrinsically interesting instead of trying to make something inherently dull entertaining. And it would be good to see Snipes cut loose more than he is able to here.", "As the plot grows more intricate, strangely the tension dissipates, until finally the movie just seems to run out of breath.", "What should have been a tense political thrilling blockbuster, ends up a wasted effort with a limp storyline that once again fails to give the book justice.", "aufman's heavy-handedness and a half-baked script with unfocused performances to match render this unentertaining, vacuous nonsense.", "The film grafts a fiercely modernist feel onto characters and themes right out of a 1940s film noir--an impressive achievement that more than makes up for a ponderous storyline.", "When working in genre territory before, the idiosyncratic Kaufman has shown a marked tendency to debunk or subvert conventions. Playing it straight here, he brings little to the table.", "I found it pretty entertaining, as well as provocative in some of its comments about contemporary life.", "Snipes at his coolest still can't save this xenophobic piece of studio flotsam.", "Kaufman's PC adaptation falls awkwardly between the conventions of the Hollywood conspiracy thriller and something intended as more artily significant.", "An intriguing, sensual whodunit that would have been even better had it not succumb to political correctness and changed the identity of the killer from Crichton's novel.", "The film disappoints, but Snipes and Connery don't.", "A 1980s style film adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel.", "", ""], "rating": ["", "1/4", "", "C+", "B-", "C", "", "", "2/5", "", "3/4", "", "", "2/5", "", "7/10", "2.5/4", "2/5", "3/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Malcolm Johnson", "Gene Siskel", "Quentin Curtis", "Owen Gleiberman", "Dennis Schwartz", "Emanuel Levy", "Richard Schickel", "David Ansen", "Angie Errigo", "", "", "Todd McCarthy", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Rob Vaux", "Geoff Andrew", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "Michael Dequina", "Jonathan W.
