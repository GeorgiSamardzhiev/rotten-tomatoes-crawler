{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Jack Grimaldi (Gary Oldman) is a cop who offers tips to the Mafia for money, and cheats on his loving wife with a young mistress. His life changes when an Italian mob boss, Don Falcone (Roy Scheider), asks him to kill Mona Demarkov (Lena Olin), a Russian assassin. But Mona escapes from Jack's grasp at every opportunity, leaving him to face dire consequences, dragging him into a lethal game of cat and mouse and manipulating him into carrying out otherwise unimaginable acts.", "rating": "26", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Art House & International/Comedy/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Peter Medak", "studio": "PolyGramFilmedEntertainment,WorkingTitleFilms", "theater_date": "Feb 4, 1994", "dvd_date": "Apr 12, 2017", "box_office": "$3.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's exactly the type of dark hearted nightmare all but extinct in today's landscape of commercialized narratives.", "The result is a total delectable mess that likely has a drinking game embedded in it somewhere.", "It's noir lite.", "Lena Olin delivers a bravura performance that overwhelms everything else in the picture, much like a tsunami laying way to a seaside shack.", "", "It's a senseless, tasteless and demented postmodern noir that has about as much class as a gimpy $10 Times Square hooker.", "This is a battle-of-the-sexes movie played out at such a pitch of pervsity and amorality that it ultimately becomes rather laughable.", "[It's] never content with one cliche when it can shovel on ten.", "The cast tries to make up for the script's hollowness by hurling themselves headlong into the sort of bloody, sweating, spittle-spewing performances that can sometimes turn thin material into personal triumphs, but to little avail.", "The far-fetched plotting eventually goes so far over the top that pic flirts with inventing a new genre of film noir camp.", "It would be facile to say it substitutes style for content; actually, it substitutes stylishness for style.", "Stylistic but ultimately unsatisfying.", "An underrated gem. Gary Oldman is amazing.", "Film noir at its worst and most excessive, an exercise in style, marred by ridicuolous voiceover narration and incomprehensible plot points; Lena Olin gives a sexy over the top performance.", "Hilary Henkin's script isn't as smart as it thinks it is, and only Olin's breathtakingly excessive femme fatale hits the right note of campy panache.", "", "Perversely fascinating.
