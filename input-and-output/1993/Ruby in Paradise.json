{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Ruby Lee Gissing (Ashley Judd) is on the run, determined to find something better than the closed rough life in the mountains of East Tennessee. She flees to a place once visited as a child, the \"Redneck Riviera\" of Panama City Beach. Arriving during the off-season, Ruby finds work in a gift shop owned by Mildred Chambers (Dorothy Lyman). Always on an emotional and economic edge, Ruby begins to keep a journal, \"trying to figure out the whys of running off, of coming here.\" Ruby's desire to find her own way, to make her own choices, to explore her appetites in her own good time, gets her in and out of trouble as she moves through Winter into the frantic madness of Spring Break and beyond. The resolution of Ruby's journey is both unexpected and hopeful as Ruby indeed finds her own way in \"paradise.\"", "rating": "84", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Victor Nunez", "studio": "FullCrew/SayYea,RubyinParadise", "theater_date": "Oct 8, 1993", "dvd_date": "Feb 16, 2021", "box_office": "$77.6K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The film ends up being about whether she'll land on her feet, when what we really want to see is whether she can stand tall.", "This is a warm, perceptive film of everyday life, free of epic tragedy, yet it reveals the courage it can take to strike out on one's own and to take charge of one's own destiny.", "The tempo is slow and dreamy, but the flavor is rich, and it lasts.", "Ashley Judd has all the makings of a big movie star.", "Nunez is a major filmmaker who thrives working in a minor key.
