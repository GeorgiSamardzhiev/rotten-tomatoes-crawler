{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Many loosely connected characters cross paths in this film, based on the stories of Raymond Carver. Waitress Doreen Piggot (Lily Tomlin) accidentally runs into a boy with her car. Soon after walking away, the child lapses into a coma. While at the hospital, the boy's grandfather (Jack Lemmon) tells his son, Howard (Bruce Davison), about his past affairs. Meanwhile, a baker (Lyle Lovett) starts harassing the family when they fail to pick up the boy's birthday cake.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "3h 9m", "director": "Robert Altman", "studio": "FineLineFeatures,AvenuePicturesProductions", "theater_date": "Oct 1, 1993", "dvd_date": "Dec 17, 2007", "box_office": "$6.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A movie of Carver's work needed to show this process whereby simple acts and objects are also abstractions. Altman has shown it...", "Whether their characters are congenial, contemptible or just absurd, Altman gets the best from an extraordinary company.", "Worth the buy for one scene: watching a young Robert Downey, Jr. elbow-punch a couch.", "It's a funny/scary vision, with a manic edge -- which is why, when you come down from the high of the filmmaking, you may be left with the taste of ashes in your mouth. Altman's artistry can make you happy even when his art offers cold comfort.", "We are never made to care much about the afflicted characters because Altman doesn't and thereby the stories carry very little weight.", "", "The epidosic (by necessity) movie is uneven, but some of the stories are poignant and the acting always compelling", "Performances are low key but accomplished, comedy and tragedy are delicately balanced and the whole thing has the feel of a sprawling but very absorbing soap.", "Cool, clever and complex, Altman succeeds in bringing out the best from a highly talented cast.", "As the grand ringmaster, it's here that Altman passes the baton to his actors , whose behavioral insights are critical to the film's success.", "The film is fascinating and complex, and benefits from a densely textured soundtrack that makes it as interesting to listen to as to watch.", "Inevitably it's a mixed bag, though the film's assurance in keeping it all coherent is at times exhilarating.", "Not prime Altman, but weaves an interesting path due to many sub-plots.", "", "From the exhilarating opening, you know Altman's epic 'adaptation' of eight stories and a poem by Raymond Carver is going to be special.", "Altman weaves magic from Carver's character-rich material.", "An absolutely brilliant, 3-hour examination of detached, dysfunctional behavior in modern America. Easily one of Altman's best films.", "", "", ""], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "B-", "A", "B", "4/5", "4/5", "", "3.5/4", "", "3/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "4/4", "5/5", "3/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Veronica Geng", "Malcolm Johnson", "Chase Whale", "David Ansen", "Dennis Schwartz", "Owen Gleiberman", "Emanuel Levy", "Film4 Staff", "Angie Errigo", "Todd McCarthy", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Steve Crum", "Boyd van Hoeij", "Geoff Andrew", "Cole Smithey", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "Jake Euker", "Emanuel Levy", "Thomas Delapa"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New York Review of Books", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ChaseWhale.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Video-Reviewmaster.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">european-films.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fantastica Daily", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">F5 (Wichita, KS)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boulder Weekly"], "date": ["August 14, 2018", "May 11, 2018", "October 19, 2016", "April 7, 2016", "January 22, 2012", "September 7, 2011", "April 28, 2011", "February 27, 2008", "February 27, 2008", "February 27, 2008", "February 27, 2008", "February 27, 2008", "February 22, 2008", "October 19, 2006", "June 24, 2006", "October 10, 2005", "October 8, 2005", "July 1, 2005", "June 25, 2005", "April 13, 2005"]}}
