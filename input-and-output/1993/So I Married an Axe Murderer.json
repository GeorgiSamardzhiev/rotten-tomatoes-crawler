{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Just after a bad breakup, Charlie MacKenzie (Mike Myers) falls for lovely butcher Harriet Michaels (Nancy Travis) and introduces her to his parents. But, as voracious consumers of sensational tabloids, his parents soon come to suspect that Harriet is actually a notorious serial killer -- \"Mrs. X\" -- wanted in connection with a string of bizarre honeymoon killings. Thinking his parents foolish, Charlie proposes to Harriet. But while on his honeymoon with her, he begins to fear they were right.", "rating": "53", "genre": "Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Thomas Schlamme", "studio": "TriStarPictures,Fried/WoodsFilms", "theater_date": "Jul 30, 1993", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$9.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Comedian Mike Myers is best handled in incredibly small doses.", "Fact is, So I Married An Axe Murderer fails on every level as a romantic comedy. It wants romance and a happy ending and a Woman-from-Hell.", "You may feel trapped in a Saturday Night Live skit part of the time; the silly plot doesn't hang together well, and too many bawdy jokes misfire. Nevertheless, a sweetness pervades the film, which provides a generous view of human nature.", "The relationship between Travis and Myers is boring; too bad the whole film wasn't about the Scottish family. They deserve their own picture.", "Best of all, are the characters who would be at home in one of Hitchcock's wackier outings: folks who are sympathetic or absurd, notorious or utterly psycho.", "Funny spoof on serial killers.", "Quirky '90s comedy with mock horror action, sexuality.", "Everyone quotes the Scottish-accented misanthropy. But at its heart, \"Axe\" is a sweet, funny romance between people trapped in patterns and freed by a positive paradigm shift. It's also the reason we never see Mike Myers' true face in films anymore.", "Although Myers is a brilliant comic, any potential he has as a romantic lead remains unfulfilled.", "Arkin and the late Hartman also provide memorable moments, while the film as a whole is good-natured enough to make up for its inconsistency.", "A tres hip slice of life about the dilemma of marital commitment with just a pinch of Hitchcock providing the cutting edge.", "Myers pumps out a river of inventive shtick, but it doesn't cohere or connect; he seems less a character than a comedian doing couch time on a late-night talk show.", "Not great, but is very watchable romance comedy.", "Like an exploding haggis, funny but extremely messy.", "", "A disappointing film that never finds its right tone", "mike myers' only tolerable picture", "", "The look of So I Married an Axe Murderer is crisply professional, and John Graysmark's production design provides an element of visual surprise.", ""], "rating": ["2/10", "", "", "2/4", "", "B", "3/5", "4/5", "2/4", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "2/5", "C", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Kathi Maio", "Marilynne S.
