{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1979 Cuba, flamboyant gay artist Diego (Jorge Perugorr\u00eda) attempts to seduce the straight and strait-laced David (Vladimir Cruz), an idealistic young communist, and fails dismally. But David conspires to be \"friends\" with Diego so he can monitor the artist's subversive life for the state. As Diego and David discuss politics, individuality and personal expression in Castro's Cuba, a genuine friendship develops between the two. Can it last in such an oppressive environment?", "rating": "81", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Tom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez Alea, Juan Carlos Tab\u00edo", "studio": "MiramaxFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$268.8K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Truth be told, I sat there and chuckled warmly in all the right spots, and felt delight in the stubbornly stylish central character.", "", "Its subject now reveals itself as political and social freedom in Castro's Cuba and this is what makes it an intelligent companion piece to Memories of Underdevelopment, Alea's earlier film.", "While the central story may lack edge, 'Strawberry and Chocolate' remains an entertaining, thoughtful take on the absurdity of confusing sexuality and politics.", "A clear call for tolerance, deftly executed by a director for whom the personal and the political were indivisible.", "It's a clear-eyed critique of the revolution's treatment of gay Cubans and, as such, it's a brave and important piece of film-making.", "Watching his funny and likeable Havana-set comedy is like chancing upon some undiscovered early gem by Godard or Woody Allen, and yet it has a worldliness and drollery that is all its own.", "It's rather long-winded and the politics are pretty boring to an outsider.", "A superb Cuban film from 1993, a little classic about gay freedom and its aspirations versus Fidel Castro and his Marxist straitjacketing.", "It verges on the preachy, but it's a generous and intriguing film.", "Strawberry & Chocolate (Fresa y Chocolate) has a special place in cinema history.", "The film's premise (friendship between a straight and gay man) may be familiar, but set in Cuba the tale's particular context adds freshness and political alertness, resulting in a charming film with a quasi-hopeful message", "Intelligent political drama", "This first gay filmic offering from Cuba actually plays a good deal better than it sounds.", "", "Beautiful.", "", "The movie has real strength and charm, especially in the way it leads us to expect a romance, and then gives us a character whose very existence is a criticism of his society.", "", ""], "rating": ["", "B", "4/5", "3/5", "3.5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "2/5", "", "2/5", "", "B+", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "1.5/4", "3.5/4", "1.5/4", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Robert Horton", "Owen Gleiberman", "Derek Malcolm", "Tom Huddlestone", "Jon Fortgang", "Wendy Ide", "Peter Bradshaw", "Sky Staff", "Nigel Andrews", "Robert Hanks", "Allan Hunter", "Emanuel Levy", "John A.
