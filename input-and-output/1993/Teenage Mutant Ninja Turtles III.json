{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Reporter April O'Neil (Paige Turco) purchases an ancient Japanese scepter that can cause those simultaneously holding it in different centuries to switch places in time. When she is transported to 16th-century Japan, her crime-fighting pals, the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, pursue her. After landing in the past, the Turtles learn April has been captured by the villainous Lord Norinaga (Sab Shimono). To rescue her, they must team up with rebel leader Misu (Vivian Wu).", "rating": "23", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Stuart Gillard", "studio": "GoldenHarvestCompany", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 2, 2008", "box_office": "$42.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Ninja turtles travel to ancient Japan; some mild peril.", "A little surprisingly, director-writer Stuart Gillard rises to the occasion with an often elegant film.", "Rinky-dink production values, and sheer mindlessness and creative bankruptcy.", "Less amateurish than the 1990 original, less embarrassing than the 1991 sequel (with its mind-boggling Vanilla Ice ninja-rap number), this may be the easiest installment in the series for parents to sit through.", "Really stupid.", "Writer/director Stuart Gillard tries to inject some life into the project by including some tongue-in-cheek scenes in 17th-century Japan, but it quickly degenerates into half-hearted cartoonish action.", "These fighting-intensive movies, a glorification of hurtful action, are strictly for children.
