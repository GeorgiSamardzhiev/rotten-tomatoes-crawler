[Full Review in Spanish]", "For such a dark, gritty, ferocious film, the big, melodramatic finish betrays its creepy, low-budget aesthetic.", "Aja's film is partly a critique of nuclear war, partly a horror fable about the divide between Americans and the violence it inevitably causes.", "Craven was looking to simply scare some folks with blunt violence and a lecture on the primal nature of man. Aja's effort is an absolute declaration of war.", "Falls into the trap of delivering its relentless arsenal of painful images with almost sedated enthusiasm. The movie has no venom.", "On the strength of their 2003 slasher flick, High Tension, Craven hired director-writer Alexandre Aja and writer Gr\u00e9gory Levasseur, and the result is one of the most exhilarating, intense, and engrossing Hollywood shockers ever made.", "Still not a perfect film, but it's still superior to the original.", "Of considerably richer interest than the revampings of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre and The Fog, not the least for having American-heartland horrors viewed through foreign glasses", "It is an artfully crafted exercise in high-octane style, bolstered by a stronger cast than most horror films could ever hope to assemble, but it's a bitter, sleazy little pill that leaves an ugly aftertaste.", "Some say this remake is better than the original, but it ain't so.", "It's self-conscious nastiness, once removed from its motivating source.", "... a scary, if none-too-original, horror movie. (Unrated)", "The resulting bloodbath, both nasty and hilarious, is a master class in the art of the remake, wavering somewhere between respectful reimagining and gleeful pastiche.", "Like Craven's original, Aja's version gets the job done - it makes your stomach turn, puts you on edge, and gives you a horror-movie ride.", "The film is intelligent and aware, if utterly gross, and on a technical level it's first-rate.", "full review in Greek", "It was going to take a lot to sell me on the remake. It delivered.", "These Hills might have eyes, but they could have used some brains, or at least a steadier hand and a less contemptible sensibility to guide the grisly proceedings.", "The Hills Have Eyes involves one basic premise: freaks with very rusty weapons eviscerating, disemboweling and decapitating stupid travelers lost somewhere between Point A and B ...", "To describe this film as \"pornographically violent\" is an affront to pornography."], "rating": ["", "2.5/4", "4.5/5", "B+", "2/4", "4/5", "", "", "2.5/4", "3/4", "2/5", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "A", "F", "1/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Alberto Abu\u00edn", "Matthew Lucas", "C.H.
