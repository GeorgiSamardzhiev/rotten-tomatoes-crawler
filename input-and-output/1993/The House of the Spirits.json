But so much has been cut away that only the skeleton of the story remains.", "If The House of the Spirits fails to reinvent its traditional form as The Piano did, it still redresses Hollywood's usual sexual politics -- and provides an exotic wallow.", "It's also a wretched paradox: a big budget, star-driven art film whose very elements subvert its ambitions and turn it into the thing it least wants to be -- a listless '50s-style Hollywood melodrama.", "The thing works in its goofy way, mainly because Bille August is a man of apparently dauntless conviction. He has written and directed every scene with serene authority.", "The flaws aren't fatal. The beauty and brilliance that might have been, don't preclude the quality and bravery that exist on the screen.", "The House of the Spirits is like Gone With the Wind with the fun and excitement replaced by lofty. All that's left is the wind.", "How can an accomplished director take a great novel, the best actors working and the finest technicians available and make a film so... bland? It's a puzzlement.", "This isn't just a bad movie -- it's hugely, grandiosely, pompously bad.", "Similar epics are made with more conviction and less pretension on daytime TV.", "The film version stresses political intrigue and revolutionary violence at The expense of the anything-goes dreaminess that gives the book its most memorable moments. A stellar cast doesn't help much.", "Inert from its opening moments to its too-long-delayed close, this lackluster production is an example of international filmmaking at its least attractive, and a misstep in the careers of pretty much everyone involved.", "It's always painful when a brilliant book becomes a bust of a movie.", "This is really quite an achievement. It brings together Jeremy Irons, Meryl Streep, Winona Ryder, Antonio Banderas, and Vanessa Redgrave and insures that, without exception, they all give their worst performances ever.", "The story, from the best-selling novel by Isabel Allende, is purely incidental to the unintentionally hysterical stylings of this potential camp cult film. It's truly awful, and one shouldn't miss it for the world.", "Given the talents involved, the film's hesitations in style and consistent failure to really move must be counted as a major disappointment.", "August's earnest International Motion Picture Adaptation remains all too tethered to earth, weighted down by a surfeit of good intentions.", "Antonio Banderas invigorates this glum gothic family saga as a defiant young Chilean revolutionary. And without her idea for The House of The Spirits, Isabel Allende insists she would not be a writer today.", "Just as the characters' motivations are mostly crude rather than complex, and the view of class politics superficial and romantic rather than acute or intelligent, so is the film's treatment of the novel's magical realism on the mundane side.", ""], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "1/5", "2/4", "1/4", "", "", "1.5/5", "", "", "1/4", "2/5", "C", "", "", "4/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Ansen", "Malcolm Johnson", "Quentin Curtis", "Stephen Hunter", "Richard Schickel", "Michael Wilmington", "Jay Boyar", "Carrie Rickey", "Gary Thompson", "", "David Sterritt", "Kenneth Turan", "Peter Travers", "Anthony Lane", "", "Angie Errigo", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Prairie Miller", "Todd McCarthy", "Michael Dequina"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent on Sunday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rolling Stone", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WBAI Radio", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieReport.com"], "date": ["May 22, 2018", "May 22, 2018", "December 12, 2017", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "May 20, 2013", "September 7, 2011", "April 30, 2011", "September 26, 2008", "January 9, 2007"]}}
