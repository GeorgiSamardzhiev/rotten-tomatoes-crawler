Frears knows how to direct actors by this time, and there is hardly a false note. The filmmakers treat the Armstrong saga as a modern crime story.", "The biopic of disgraced Tour de France racer Lance Armstrong begins like a fairy tale, although one with doping and cancer, but ends as a Shakespearean tragedy.", "It may not take a groundbreaking approach to biographical drama, but Frears' The Program draws strong performances...", "It must be said that Foster excels as Armstrong. Bearing an unnerving physical resemblance to the fallen cycling hero, he is a revelation in a remarkable tour de force -- not France -- performance.", "The Program is never less than interesting, and the cast is high-caliber. However, the movie makes us want to know more, rather than come away with the sense that we've been through an experience ourselves.", "Foster, though, delivers a strong and convincing performance, and I could watch films about Armstrong and his evil machinations for ever. This one may fail to unearth many of his mysteries, but it is a confident, if understated, offering.", "The abiding achievement of the film rests throughout with Foster, who can shift on a dime from the charismatic to the repellent and whose Armstrong is at his most grimly compelling when engaged in an ongoing commentary with himself.", "The Program can be viewed as especially relevant, given that doping in sport is coincidentally, in the news again.", "All said and done, if you want to gain a perspective on what went wrong in Armstrong's professional pursuits, this film is worth a watch. But if you have plans of discovering more about the man himself, we'll just have to wait for a more solid reboot.", "Poor Ben Foster is on a truly thankless mission playing such an unlikeable character. But the film does just about get there in the end, helped by some shocking scenes and the sheer power of the underlying story.", "There is never a moment that makes you understand Armstrong's motivations. Every plot point is dealt in a business-like manner.", "The Program is a drama, not a documentary, which allows it to flesh out the bones of this story into something approaching a minor Shakespearean tragedy.", "[Foster] has admitted to a certain admiration for Armstrong. This is evident in the compassion built into his portrayal, which adds complexity to the slick veneer of Frears's obvious antipathy for his subject.", "Basically the same as The Armstrong Lie documentary but with less cycling scenes and the repulsive but appealing performance from Ben Foster.[Full review in Spanish]", "It's a shame Frears didn't fully approach the character and its subjects as expected. [Full review in Spanish]", "The movie makes great use of the journalistic work of Dave Walsh to create intimate moments that help understand the main character's motivations. [Full review in Spanish]", "A thrilling modern American tragedy about one of the greatest athletes of our day. [Full review in Spanish]", "It makes great use of the events surrounding Armstrong's lies to create a great deal of suspense. [Full review in Spanish]", "It's a shame that a director like Stephen Frears ended up making such a weak film.
