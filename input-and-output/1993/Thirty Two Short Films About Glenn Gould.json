{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this episodic fusion of documentary and biographical drama, director Fran\u00e7ois Girard explores the life of 20th-century pianist Glenn Gould through a series of brief fictional reenactments and real interviews with those who knew the musician. After distinguishing himself as a prodigy at a very young age, the enigmatic Gould (Colm Feore) grows up to dissect the accepted rules of musical theory, and eventually refuses to perform before an audience. He also becomes addicted to prescription pills.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Art House & International/Documentary/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Fran\u00e7ois Girard", "studio": "CanadianBroadcastingCorporation", "theater_date": "Nov 26, 1993", "dvd_date": "Jan 20, 2017", "box_office": "$1.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Instead of a laborious bio-pic, we get a sly, quick-witted meditation on a character always likely to elude our grasp.", "If only more filmmakers would take the fragmented, kaleidoscopic approach of Thirty Two Short Films About Glenn Gould, which captures the essence of the famed pianist (and radio broadcaster) by honoring his unruliness.", "", "One of the great documentaries, or if you will semi-documentaries.", "An assured melange of dramatic re-creation, archival material and interviews, it is a uniquely entertaining venture", "The film's strategy is to present many diverse fragments about Gould, each capturing an aspect of his artistry and/or personality, so that the cumulative effect would give the viewer a glimpse of the man and his times.", "...but not one long one.", "", "", "An engaging and rather appropriate perspective on the gifted and eccentric musician.", "", "A brilliant and transfixing cinematic portrait by Francois Girard.", "These episodic adventures are a joy to watch and although not all of them are as memorable as each other, each has an entertaining quality that means the film as a whole will stick with you for a long time.", "", "", "", "Imaginative and engaging work of art which pioneers a new form of screen biography.", "", "The films are short, vignettes mostly, but in concert they do more than a conventional two-hour biopic ever could.", ""], "rating": ["", "", "A-", "A", "", "4/5", "2/5", "5/5", "5/5", "4/5", "2.5/4", "", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "", "5/5", "8", "3.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Anthony Lane", "Mike D&#39;Angelo", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Dennis Schwartz", "Leonard Klady", "Emanuel Levy", "Jake Euker", "Frank Swietek", "Carol Cling", "Dan Lybarger", "Neil Martin", "Janet Maslin", "Angie Errigo", "Robert Roten", "Philip Martin", "Sean P.
