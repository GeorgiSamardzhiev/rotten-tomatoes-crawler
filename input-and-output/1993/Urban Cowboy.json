{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After moving to Pasadena, Texas, country boy Bud Davis (John Travolta) starts hanging around a bar called Gilley's, where he falls in love with Sissy (Debra Winger), a cowgirl who believes the sexes are equal. They eventually marry, but their relationship is turbulent due to Bud's traditional view of gender roles. Jealousy over his rival, Wes (Scott Glenn), leads to their separation, but Bud attempts to win Sissy back by triumphing at Gilley's mechanical bull-riding competition.", "rating": "73", "genre": "Drama/Western", "runtime": "2h 15m", "director": "James Bridges", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "Jun 6, 1980", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["In short, the fact that all three central characters are fallible is unique as it makes the characters less archetypes and more human.", "Travolta is fine, but Winger and Glenn are the ones who truly add fire to the film.", "Just how his camera lingers on Travolta gives new meaning to the notion of the gay gaze...", "Winger... shines, stealing every scene she is in.
