The actor builds, in precise increments, a devastating portrait of a macho control freak; he even finds a kind of ghastly humor in the character's madness.", "Though the picture rightfully belongs to Bassett, a final word must be said about Fishburne, who never fails to make Ike seem human if not defensible. Even in defeat, he is remarkably compelling.", "Agreeably camped-up biopic, ringing with righteous sentimentality and brassy defiance, with a furiously good central performance from Bassett.", "Basset genuinely holds your sympathy as the little country girl Anna Mae Bullock, singing and suffering her way to superstardom and personal liberation, [and] Fishburne is sensational.", "Angela Bassett gives a superbly versatile performance as the heroine, and Laurence Fishburne's portrayal of Ike Turner consolidates his status as one of the most expressive and intelligent actors in movies today.", "Brian Gibson, who directed the script by Kate Lanier, seems to have trouble taking charge of his material as he skips through the years.", "A powerful, joyful, raw, energetically acted bio-pic detailing the joys and pain of the on- and offstage lives of blues rockers Ike and Tina Turner.", "As a powerhouse showcase for the acting talents of Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne and as a potent portrayal of wife beating and the emotions that surround it, it's quite a show.", "It's an astonishing movie, first because despite the pathology of the relationship, it's not only about victimization; it's a celebration of spirit, both religious and human, about a woman who finally found the guts (and the faith) to say \"No more.\"", "Fishburne and Bassett are both extraordinary, and though the story is inevitably slanted to Tina's perspective, Fishburne makes Ike a complex and compelling presence.", "A splashy, volatile, crowd- pleasing rock-star melodrama that makes up in sheer emotional wallop what it sometimes lacks in finesse.", "Powerful bio of Tina Turner with domestic violence, drugs.", "A passionate personal and professional drama that hits both the high and low notes of an extraordinary career."], "rating": ["", "", "", "3/4", "3/4", "3/4", "3/5", "", "4.5/5", "", "4/5", "", "2/4", "4/4", "", "3.5/4", "3/4", "A-", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Malcolm Johnson", "Candice Frederick", "Candice Russell", "Jeff Shannon", "Carrie Rickey", "Gary Thompson", "Jay Boyar", "Terrence Rafferty", "Kenneth Turan", "", "", "David Sterritt", "Clifford Terry", "Gene Siskel", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Stephen Hunter", "", "Owen Gleiberman", "Renee Schonfeld", "Variety Staff"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Talk Online", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety"], "date": ["June 6, 2018", "September 8, 2017", "July 29, 2013", "July 29, 2013", "July 29, 2013", "July 29, 2013", "July 29, 2013", "July 29, 2013", "July 29, 2013", "July 29, 2013", "July 29, 2013", "July 29, 2013", "July 29, 2013", "July 29, 2013", "July 29, 2013", "July 29, 2013", "July 29, 2013", "September 7, 2011", "March 1, 2011", "March 26, 2009"]}}
