{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Two old men in a Florida town become friends more out of loneliness than compatibility. Ex-sea captain Frank (Richard Harris) is a garrulous teller of tales; Walter (Robert Duvall), a dignified former barber. Frank hopes to bed either the woman he meets at the movies (Piper Laurie) or his flinty landlady (Shirley MacLaine). Walter frequents a caf\u00e9, where he shyly flirts with a young waitress (Sandra Bullock). But it's the bond between the two men that thrives -- until their bitter falling-out.", "rating": "57", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 2m", "director": "Randa Haines", "studio": "WarnerBros.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 14, 2012", "box_office": "$62.6K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Mostly dull but likable senior citizen melodrama.", "Wrestling Ernest Hemingway aspires to be serious about its subject. Yet in a curious way this sobriety works against it. Frank and Walt turn into schematically contrasting case studies, and the movie's sympathy for them eventually becomes patronizing.", "Offers little in the way of narrative drive or plot conflict, and what does happen is far from surprising. MacLaine and Piper Laurie are more or less wasted in supporting roles, and pretty Sandra Bullock is given almost nothing to do.", "This is a film of two superlative performances from Richard Harris and Robert Duvall, who play an odd couple drawn together by their common loneliness as they become friends in the winter of their lives", "Randa Haines' sappy, rather dull melodrama about the friendship between two eccentric old men is mostly a showcase for its stars, Robert Duvall and Richard Harris.", "There aren't really any surprises, but it's a delight to see a movie which idles away without anything more pressing on its mind than people.", "A deeply moving and wonderfully acted film about loneliness and friendship. This is one to treasure.", "", "", "", "A slow-paced and sentimental film, but still a pleasure to watch as the two brilliant and dignified leads play off each other so well.", "Funny, touching, understated. Melancholy, bittersweet, lovely.", "Instead of simply assuming that the old have interesting lives, the film never stops congratulating itself for being daring enough to focus on them.", "Duvall and Harris are as touching, as they are mezmerising.", "Portrays the salutary ways in which two very dissimiliar elders enrich each other's lives.", "Steve Conrad's debut screenplay says little that's new, but the actors make it fresher and more powerful than it has a right to be.", "The movie is essentially about the close observation of behavior. Like some of Hemingway's stories, the real action is all implied. The characters trade small talk, and we sense that larger issues are lurking beneath their cheerfulness.", "It's another right of passage movie that pinballs off of clichs as though that is a way to achieve meaning.", "Wrestling Ernest Hemingway is melodramatic, and its pacing is rather slow, but it is also filled with fine acting and quirky but believable relationships, and ultimately proves quite satisfying.", "An endearing buddy movie for the senior crowd."], "rating": ["C+", "", "2/4", "", "C", "", "5/5", "2/5", "3/5", "2/5", "", "", "2/5", "3/5", "", "2.5/4", "3/4", "2/5", "7/10", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Dennis Schwartz", "Richard Schickel", "", "Urban Cinefile Critics", "Emanuel Levy", "", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "Emanuel Levy", "Philip Martin", "Todd Jorgenson", "Film4 Staff", "Martin Scribbs", "Caryn James", "Caffeinated Clint", "Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat", "James Berardinelli", "Roger Ebert", "Louis Black", "Scott Renshaw", "Rita Kempley"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Urban Cinefile", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fantastica Daily", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Denton Record-Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Low IQ Canadian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Moviehole", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spirituality &amp; Practice", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ReelViews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Sun-Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Austin Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rec.arts.movies.reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post"], "date": ["December 28, 2015", "June 14, 2009", "June 14, 2009", "July 19, 2008", "June 27, 2007", "January 26, 2006", "October 5, 2005", "June 14, 2005", "April 28, 2005", "April 25, 2005", "July 20, 2004", "July 7, 2004", "May 20, 2003", "September 19, 2002", "August 20, 2002", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000"]}}
