These kids are no Spy Kids.", "Instead of exalting physical grace and virtuosity, this film's slapdash action sequences resort repeatedly to the old trick of accelerating the action to the speed of a silent-film chase.", "Even worse than the original ... which was pretty dire to begin with.", "All movies hope to turn a buck, though few of them actually attain this goal (at least, not in any substantial measure). Then there are movies whose only goal is to turn a buck.", "If this first sequel is any indication, however, the 3 Ninjas franchise has already run out of steam.", "Who was this movie made for?
