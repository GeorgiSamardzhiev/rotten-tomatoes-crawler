{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When his friend Huang (Tony Leung Ka Fai) visits mercenary Ou-yang (Leslie Cheung), they trade stories including that of princess Mu-rong (Brigitte Lin), who is alternately male and female. Peach Blossom (Carina Lau) quarrels with her blind husband (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), a swordsman who wants to avenge the bereavement of a peasant girl (Maggie Cheung). The girl also attracts the favors of the swordsman Hung Chi (Jacky Cheung), who is forever trailed by his doting wife (Li Bai).", "rating": "78", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Art House & International", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Kar-Wai Wong", "studio": "", "theater_date": "Oct 10, 2008", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$173.5K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Convoluted, cryptic and confusing, but it looks and sounds amazing.", "Without a comprehensible plot, Ashes of Time Redux feels like a waste of time.", "...mostly this is a movie that wants to linger on mesmerizing movement.", "If Wong Kar-wai's Ashes of Time Redux (2008) is not the most beautiful movie ever made, then at least its beauty is sufficient to obliterate, for the moment, the memory of all others.", "It's hard to recommend a film as frustratingly inaccessible as this one, but if you go into the theater expecting a trip to an art gallery, you might be pleasantly surprised.", "Redux clocks in at a slightly shorter running time than any of the previous versions Wong has offered. The tighter edit is a better fit, but ultimately, it's not enough.", "The film's imagery is its most striking asset, creating an impressionistic sense of both vastness and intimacy that frequently overwhelms the characters and their problems.", "It's like watching paint dry--which isn't very exciting, however pretty the colors.", "Ashes of Time Redux, like that line from Hey Jude, takes a sad song and makes it better.", "Wong Kar Wai could make even a compost heap look as gorgeous as a Vermeer.", "I know Kar Wai's got a fanbase, but to me he's equivalent to a recent film school graduate using all of the post-production tricks that he's learned, either to show off what he's learned or to cover up his lack of talent.", "Wong's film is to be appreciated as poetry on film, an aphorism-filled ode to lovestruck dreamers, and for its beautifully rendered images.", "The motion picture as mood ring.", "Maybe something gets lost in the translation, as often happens, but Wong may be giving us the first Eastern.", "Unfathomably gorgeous; perhaps even the most gorgeous film Wong Kar-Wai has yet made, which is not a bit of praise I hand out lightly.", "Beautiful to look at, with painterly compositions, gorgeous, emotionally charged close-ups and slick, elegant transitions. It's all for naught because the story seems no more coherent than the flourishes of a kaleidoscope.", "In the end, it's not unlike a Jackson Pollock painting. No matter how close or how far away you stand from it, some people just get it and some people don't.", "For this director's cut, Wong has trimmed several minutes and reorganized the narrative according to the passage of seasons, though the plot is still impenetrable.", "Wong Kar-Wai doesn't supply much of a plot with a narrative engine to pull us through.", "Even drastically altered as it has been in Ashes of Time Redux, the strengths and weaknesses of the film are the same."], "rating": ["2.5/5", "2/4", "3.5/4", "", "2.5/4", "3/5", "3/4", "C-", "3/4", "2.5/4", "", "3/4", "3/4", "2/4", "8/10", "1/4", "3/4", "", "2/4", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Harris", "Brandy McDonnell", "Josh Larsen", "Amy Taubin", "Sonny Bunch", "Rob Boylan", "James Kendrick", "Frank Swietek", "Duane Dudek", "Chris Hewitt", "Austin Kennedy", "Michael Smith", "Matt Brunson", "Larry Ratliff", "Tim Brayton", "Phil Villarreal", "Jason Heck", "Andrea Gronvall", "Roger Ebert", "Brian Tallerico"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Oklahoman", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Artforum", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Q Network Film Desk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Guy&#39;s Opinion", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Milwaukee Journal Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">St. Paul Pioneer Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sin Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Antonio Express-News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arizona Daily Star", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Kansas City Star", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Sun-Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Retriever"], "date": ["October 2, 2019", "August 13, 2018", "February 29, 2016", "June 1, 2015", "August 30, 2009", "March 12, 2009", "March 12, 2009", "December 30, 2008", "December 19, 2008", "December 12, 2008", "December 12, 2008", "December 12, 2008", "November 26, 2008", "November 21, 2008", "November 20, 2008", "November 20, 2008", "November 14, 2008", "November 14, 2008", "November 14, 2008", "November 14, 2008"]}}
