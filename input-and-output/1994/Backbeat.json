Their tireless performing schedule and charismatic sound quickly put the Beatles on the road to stardom. But as Stuart falls in love with Astrid (Sheryl Lee), a local photographer, he realizes his commitment to the band isn't as strong as he thought.", "rating": "69", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Iain Softley", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 12, 2003", "box_office": "$1.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["When we have a comprehensive documentary available in the form of The Beatles Anthology, films like Backbeat end up serving as a moot point.", "Why would anyone would want to see a movie about the pre-fame Beatles when the post-fame Beatles had enough drama and excitement to fill several movies.", "Despite some meandering moments, this remains a unique experience.", "Get back, get back to where you once belonged, you want to shout. But the movie is stuck in the wrong groove.", "It is the band, the group - with or without Sutcliffe - that makes Backbeat such a powerfully emotional elegy.", "There's nothing very profound here, but we do at least get a nice handling of period and milieu, and pretty good performances of the songs.", "What pulls you over the bum spots is the electrifying immediacy.", "First-time director Iain Softley makes the film more visually distinctive than most music bios.", "The early, pre-fame days of the Beatles are a great subject for a film, but the potential has been only partly realized in Backbeat.", "The film tells the story of the original, little-known fifth Beatle, Stuart Sutcliffe, a young painter with rock n' roll sensibility who in 1960 forgoes his promising art career to join his best friend John Lennon (nicely played by Ian Hart) in Berlin", "You can't miss the affection and sincerity Backbeat carries from start to finish.... Softley bottles the attitude and energy, the excitement of the new, that were as integral to the Beatles' success as their songs.", "The music is loud and raw, but nevertheless evokes the excitement it generated.", "The music, done here by a group of grunge all-stars, doesn't even attempt to sound dead-on, but remains mostly true to the raucous spirit of the time.", "", "", "points to the tragic irony of immortality being achieved through early death", "Iain Softley directs his feature debut with simplicity and feeling, and you don't have to have been a Beatles fan to get with the beat.
