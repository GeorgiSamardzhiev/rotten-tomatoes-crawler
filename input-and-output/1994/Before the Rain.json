{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This acclaimed Macedonian drama presents intersecting romantic storylines set both in that country and abroad. A young monk named Kiril (Gr\u00e9goire Colin) becomes involved with Zamira (Labina Mitevska), an Albanian girl accused of murder, while far away in London, Aleksander (Rade Serbedzija), a weary photojournalist, meets with his married lover, Anne (Katrin Cartlidge).

If all his films are as noble, beautiful and humane as his first, the American cinema will have a new master.", "In this triptych of inhumanity, Manchevski answers that, finally, man's humanity is as immutable as his violence. And that, finally, love is a given that keeps on giving.", "We'll have to wait for Manchevski's next feature to know whether he's an artist or a shrewd entertainer. In the meantime, Before the Rain is one of the more worthy efforts of the season.", "It shakes you up the way many other notable foreign-language film debuts once did -- films like\"Breathless, The 400 Blows or Knife in the Water.", "The cast of international players is excellent, with Serbedzija delivering an especially fine performance as Aleksandar, a humanistic photographer.", "[This] eerily beautiful film constantly reminds us that there is an irresistible fascination, an absurd and terrible beauty, in the violence of our times.", "It has an unnerving feel, angrily observing the way meaningless violence can suddenly blossom and suck in innocents.", "Most of the characters are two-dimensional embodiments of commonplace attitudes, and few of the narrative developments gather much momentum.", "Striking and ambitious.", "Even if [Manchevski] ends up making American action films, I hope he doesn't lose his eye for beautiful still compositions.", "Manchevski's storytelling abilities do not yet have the self-assured sweep and coherence of his visuals, but Before the Rain is nonetheless a poetic statement.", "An important new director announces his arrival.", "Manchevski leaves us with too many unanswered questions, most of them involving the very time and space that these characters seem to inhabit all at the very same time.", "Director Milcho Manchevski brings an imposing portentousness to this portmanteau picture, but too often he mistakes ponderousness for gravity.", "It's a complex, often depressing film, but the stories are knitted together seamlessly, and Manchevski paints a grim picture of how war ruins the lives of ordinary people more than anybody's.", "Macedonian writer-director Milcho Manchevski uses the geometry of circles to build this harrowing, poetic drama about the incomprehensibility-and timelessness-of hatred, violence, and war.", "Before the Rain is a visually and narratively stunning tale in three parts, set between modern London and the timeless hills of Macedonia, in former Yugoslavia", "What it loses in novelty and subtlety it makes up for in its earnest depiction of love and individual human decency in the face of societal cruelty.", "Creates a scenario that it's inevitable the heavy rains will fall over the bloody land ... ."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "", "3.5/4", "3/4", "4/4", "", "", "4/5", "3/4", "", "4/5", "", "4/4", "2.5/4", "3/5", "", "A", "", "3/4", "B-"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Malcolm Johnson", "Quentin Curtis", "Carrie Rickey", "Dave Kehr", "Michael Wilmington", "Roger Hurlburt", "Richard Schickel", "Kim Newman", "David Sterritt", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Jay Boyar", "People Staff", "Gene Siskel", "Dan Webster", "David Parkinson", "Film4 Staff", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Deborah Young", "Jeremiah Kipp", "Dennis Schwartz"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent on Sunday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spokesman-Review (Washington)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slant Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews"], "date": ["May 3, 2018", "December 14, 2017", "July 27, 2015", "July 27, 2015", "July 27, 2015", "July 27, 2015", "July 27, 2015", "July 27, 2015", "July 27, 2015", "July 27, 2015", "July 27, 2015", "July 27, 2015", "July 27, 2015", "July 27, 2015", "July 27, 2015", "July 27, 2015", "September 7, 2011", "October 18, 2008", "August 12, 2008", "July 6, 2008"]}}
