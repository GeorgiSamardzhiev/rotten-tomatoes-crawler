He is reincarnated as a Celt, a Roman slave, a Scottish crusader, a man shipwrecked in Africa and a modern-day New Yorker. And, though the same souls keep popping up around him, including his lover and his children, Hector makes the same mistakes over and over again. But it is through these many trials and errors that Hector learns what it truly means to be human.", "rating": "54", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 2m", "director": "Bill Forsyth", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 20, 2014", "box_office": "$1.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An ultra- whimsical reverie on love and family through the ages.
