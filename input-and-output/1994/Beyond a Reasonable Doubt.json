{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Novelist Tom Garrett (Dana Andrews) and publisher Austin Spencer (Sidney Blackmer) intend to show how lawyer Roy Thompson (Philip Bourneuf) has been using circumstantial evidence in capital punishment trials. They concoct a scheme in which flimsy evidence will point to Garrett as a murder suspect, but Spencer will exonerate him at the end. Meanwhile, they keep the plan a secret from Spencer's daughter, Susan (Joan Fontaine), who is engaged to Garrett. However, the trial doesn't go as planned.", "rating": "72", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 20m", "director": "Fritz Lang", "studio": "BertE.FriedlobProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 17, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's a fairly ludicrous premise that is, for the most part, employed to watchable (if decidedly erratic) effect by Lang...", "one of the best plot twists of all time.", "It is a film of great economy and precision (it lasts only 80 minutes), with the terrifying inevitability of Greek tragedy and a pervading sense that man is his own worst enemy.", "Fritz Lang's last American movie is an edgy study in moral ambiguity.", "While perhaps overdependent on coincidence and contrivance, this deft thriller guards its secret right to the end and proved a fitting swan song to Fritz Lang's Hollywood career.", "What this tense thriller lacks in action is more than made for by unpredictable twists in the plot, as well as an eerie atmosphere created by the gothic looking buildings and black and white film.", "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt is a ludicrous story, very hard to swallow. Lang, who should have known better, must have directed this with his good eye closed.", "There's little denying that this one of Lang's lesser films, perhaps not helped by the impoverished budget.", "", "Says a prosecutor, during the trial: 'Beneath his intellectual and cultured exterior, he was moved by brutal impulses.' Is this also Lang's self-indictment? Or an indictment of any artist who trucks in sexual titillation and murder-as-entertainment?", "Strange, complexly styled crime melodrama.", "Fritz Lang's direction does what it can to inject suspense and interest but the melodrama never really jells.", "O ltimo filme americano de Lang  tambm um de seus trabalhos menos interessantes visualmente, tornando-se ainda mais decepcionante em funo do roteiro terrivelmente confuso em suas discusses morais.", "While overall the film is more mechanical and reliant on dialogue than Lang's German masterpiece M, it makes a perfect companion piece, sharing M's fascination with the criminal process.", "Lang's most austere film, reducing the characters to pawns arbitrarily shifted in demonstration of a fascinating theorem.", "Once he's raised the standard social issues, Lang destroys them all with a shatteringly nihilistic conclusion.", "While the purpose may be exemplary, the method the gentlemen employ is highly dubious as a practical exposition.
