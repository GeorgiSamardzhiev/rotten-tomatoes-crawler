{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Horror films and computer games fascinate teenager Michael (Edward Furlong), and a CD-ROM that portrays murder from the killer's point of view combines these interests. The first time Michael plays it, he kills a stranger and cuts off a foot, thinking the events take place in virtual reality. But the next day Michael finds a foot in his refrigerator, and cyber-ghoul Trickster (T. Ryder Smith) emerges from the program and forces him to keep playing -- and to continue committing violent crimes.", "rating": "19", "genre": "Horror/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "John Flynn", "studio": "AdmireProductionsLtd.,CoralProductions", "theater_date": "Apr 22, 1994", "dvd_date": "Jan 27, 2015", "box_office": "$3.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Something is missing; perhaps it's the sparseness of edgy scares, or the infrequency of gore, or the conclusion - which just doesn't know what it wants to be.", "Brainscan offers a grab bag of intriguing ideas, but the pieces never fit together.
