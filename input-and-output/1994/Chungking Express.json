{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Every day, Cop 223 (Takeshi Kaneshiro) buys a can of pineapple with an expiration date of May 1, symbolizing the day he'll get over his lost love. He's also got his eye on a mysterious woman in a blond wig (Brigitte Lin), oblivious of the fact she's a drug dealer. Cop 663 (Tony Leung Chiu Wai) is distraught with heartbreak over a breakup. But when his ex drops a spare set of his keys at a local cafe, a waitress (Faye Wong) lets herself into his apartment and spruces up his life.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama/Mystery & Suspense/Romance", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Kar-Wai Wong", "studio": "Miramax", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 21, 2002", "box_office": "$114.9K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Almost as much of a thrill as In the Mood for Love.", "Possibly the most endearing movie ever made, it's Wong Kar Wai's most exuberant work, an uncharacteristically sunny, whirling dervish of a picture positively drunk on its own technique.", "These flirtations may be as glossy and shallow as the soundtrack's pop songs, but they represent longings for magic, for transcendence, as deep as any 'California Dreamin'.'", "From its photogenic actors to its pop soundtrack and breezy visual style, the movie is a lighthearted thrill, visceral, romantic and fresh.", "Chungking Express comes to town with a hip imprimatur and some admiring reviews. But this quirky, deadpan movie moves like a rickshaw with a geriatric hauler in harness.", "What Chungking Express has are a couple of interesting situations, which don't quite justify a feature-length movie.", "I've never been a big fan of technique that calls attention to itself, but Wong's frenetic blend of slow motion, pixilation, rushing backgrounds and frozen foregrounds (or vice versa) is as integral to this movie as its bubbly story and characters.", "[Wong's] hypnotic images of love and loss finally wear down your resistance as seemingly discordant sights and sounds coalesce into a radiant, crazy quilt.", "Chungking Express is a breezy little Hong Kong movie that has more life, energy, humanity and sheer visual zing than most other shows you'll see in a month or so.", "Dull it is not, but Wong's trademark sense of romantic melancholy fails to jell amid all the excess.", "It's the cinematic equivalent of popcorn on a hot stove with jump-cut shots, freeze frames, stirringly beautiful images and boundless energy.", "A lyrical and delightfully goofy study in romantic longing.", "Written and directed by Wong Kar-wai, the film is an imaginative piece of filmmaking and an evocative essay on contemporary Hong Kong as it prepares for a return to Chinese rule.", "Made in less than three months using a hand-held camera, director/writer Wong Kar-Wai's Chungking Express is a tale that only a diehard film buff might enjoy.", "The film is so talky, repetitious, visually stuttery, and slackly paced that sitting through it once is like seeing it twice.", "Wong made Chungking in just 23 days, and the film's mad-dash energy is nicely reflected in his quartet of stars. Wong, himself a star of cinema's future, has already shown that he possesses a uniquely '90s voice, eye and spirit.", "Wong's singular frenetic visual style and his special feeling for lonely romantics may remind you of certain French New Wave directors, but this movie isn't a trip down memory lane; it's a vibrant commentary on young love today, packed with punch.", "Wong's dreamlike tone and Doyle's stunning cinematography make this strange love story a joy to watch.", "The performances as a whole are a joy and the script is a gem.", "Despite the simplicity of the stories, Chungking Express is an inventive, richly human and rewarding film that expands Hong Kong cinema in one fell swoop."], "rating": ["", "", "A", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "3.5/4", "2/4", "", "3/4", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Kelly Vance", "Sean Burns", "Jeffrey Overstreet", "Pat Padua", "Malcolm Johnson", "Robert Horton", "Jeff Shannon", "Peter Travers", "Michael Wilmington", "Dave Kehr", "Desson Thomson", "Carrie Rickey", "David Sterritt", "Roger Hurlburt", "James Wolcott", "Richard Corliss", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Kim Newman", "David Parkinson", ""], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">East Bay Express", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The ARTery", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Looking Closer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Comment Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rolling Stone", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4"], "date": ["December 16, 2020", "December 11, 2020", "March 23, 2019", "August 28, 2018", "June 8, 2018", "April 10, 2018", "May 28, 2014", "May 28, 2014", "May 28, 2014", "May 28, 2014", "May 28, 2014", "May 28, 2014", "May 28, 2014", "May 28, 2014", "May 28, 2014", "May 28, 2014", "May 28, 2014", "May 28, 2014", "May 28, 2014", "May 28, 2014"]}}
