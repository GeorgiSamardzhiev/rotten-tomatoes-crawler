{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When his brother asks him to look after his young son, Clifford (Martin Short), Martin Daniels (Charles Grodin) agrees, taking the boy into his home and introducing him to his future wife, Sarah (Mary Steenburgen). Clifford is fixated on the idea of visiting a famed theme park, and Martin, an engineer who helped build the park, makes plans to take him. But, when Clifford reveals himself to be a first-rate brat, his uncle goes bonkers, and a loony inter-generational standoff ensues.", "rating": "13", "genre": "Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 29m", "director": "Paul Flaherty", "studio": "SteinbergandTenenbaumEntertainment(MBST),OrionPictures,Brezner,Morra", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 17, 2016", "box_office": "$6.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There's Short's ability to milk moments for everything they're worth, giving the part his all, and such enthusiasm supports the endeavor through some incredibly iffy ideas.", "The kid is obnoxious from start to finish, and the way he fantasizes about his uncle's girlfriend (Mary Steenburgen) is tasteless.", "Clifford, starring Martin Short as a precociously nasty 10-year-old, is not a good movie. It's not even good/bad. But Short has a few of those laugh-out-loud moments.", "Clifford never quite finds its tone. The course of the plot has an inevitability about it that is about as wearying as it is reassuring... And yet Clifford is intermittently hilarious, mainly thanks to Short's performance.", "Short's bizarre casting is the only reason for Clifford to exist. Aside from that, this is an unimaginative, ill-begotten comedy about a bad little boy.", "Hamstrung by a script that is neither funny nor fanciful enough, Clifford just sits on the screen, as flat as last week's seltzer.", "Whether he is pretending to be angelic or flashing satanic looks, Short makes Clifford an often riotous comic creation. And Grodin, with his fussy airs, makes a perfect fall guy.", "Worthless from start to finish, Clifford is a supreme disaster -- a film that neither Short, Grodin nor Steenburgen will be adding to their resumes.", "Witless slapstick with leering, obnoxious man-child.", "A weird movie that could have stood to be weirder still.", "Orion serves up another long-on-the-shelf turkey with this gimmicky, poorly conceived comedy.", "Now let's have a show of hands: how many want to see Martin Short play a ten-year-old brat who makes everybody miserable and winds up staying with his uncle (Charles Grodin) in Los Angeles for a week?", "A hellish, horrible experience wasting the talents of all involved.", "One can't help but laugh at Short's nutty rendition of an unctous little 10-year-old devil, and Grodin's angry reactions are equally funny as his increasingly exasperated uncle.", "", "One to cross off your CV Marty", "", "[The film] isn't nearly as bad as it's been made out to be.", "Worse than you can imagine.", ""], "rating": ["B", "1/4", "", "", "2/4", "", "", "0/4", "1/5", "2.5/5", "", "", "0/5", "7/10", "2/5", "1/5", "1/5", "2/4", "0/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Brian Orndorf", "Gene Siskel", "Peter Rainer", "Jay Boyar", "Dennis King", "People Staff", "Malcolm Johnson", "Roger Hurlburt", "Renee Schonfeld", "TV Guide Staff", "Variety Staff", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Neil Cohen", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "Emanuel Levy", "Caffeinated Clint", "Daniel M.
