The wisdom of Cobb is that writer-director Ron Shelton knows that the close study of a single day can decode a human life.", "A curiously gripping amalgam of Patton, Citizen Kane and Melvin and Howard.", "To watch Tommy Lee Jones re-create the persona of the Hall of Famer in Cobb is to encounter the greatest SOB ever to come down the pike -- in or out of the domain of sports. The trek is hardly entertaining.", "While the story of Cobb himself is a worthy one (Shelton's treatment, believe it or not, even has its similarities to Orson Welles' Citizen Kane), Shelton shortchanges the very game that made the man famous.", "Unfortunately, the movie just makes Stump look like a self-important jerk, possibly a bigger jerk than Cobb, and Wuhl's affable, weightless performance doesn't help.", "Stump is well-played by affable Robert Wuhl, who has the unenviable responsibility of representing the one sane man in Ty's crazy universe.", "Cobb's accomplishments on the ball field would make for an absorbing documentary, but it's the passions and pitfalls of his private life that dominate Ron Shelton's melodramatic film.", "Cobb cuts right through the winner-take-all ethos of American athletics. It's a raw, inspired, audaciously funny, and unexpectedly moving collaboration between the writer-director Ron Shelton and Tommy Lee Jones.", "Ron Shelton, whose Bull Durham and White Men Can't Jump were jokey tales of disillusionment set in the sporting world, here redefines the life of an idol with a certain honest savagery.", "Ty Cobb is such a towering figure in this motion picture that it's easy to overlook Al Stump -- and Robert Wuhl's feisty, witty performance in the thankless role.", "[Jones] lets it all loose here. It's the performance of a lifetime: full of menace and venom, eloquence and fire, rot and pathos, crackling rawness and realism.", "The result, whether Cobb is wailing about greatness or ruminating about the dark circumstances around his father's death, is a performance too operatic and out of control.", "This is a messy movie, sometimes repetitive, sometimes too compressed and allusive. But that's like saying Ty Cobb was not a very good sport -- irrelevant in comparison to the horrific fascination of his story.", "The movie never equals the performance, but still fascinating to watch.", "Massively underrated.", "Director Shelton is a master at locker room drama, and helped by a towering performance of snarling egomania and drug-fuelled bitterness from Jones, he tackles the dichotomies of [Cobb] with engaging enthusiasm.", "It's such a potent and courageous wreck of a movie that it's worth more than most 'successes.'", "Tommy Lee Jones is superb in the title role, but writer-director Ron Shelton unwisely chose to structure the film as a two-character piece, thus placing undue attention on the lackluster character of Cobb's biographer, Al Stump.", "It's unclear just how much sympathy we are to extend the unrepentant and bullying title character."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "3/4", "", "", "4/5", "", "4/4", "", "", "2.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "2.5/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Ansen", "Gene Siskel", "Ralph Novak", "Candice Russell", "Dan Webster", "John Hartl", "Stephen Hunter", "David Sterritt", "Michael Sragow", "Tom Hutchinson", "Jay Boyar", "Michael Wilmington", "Kenneth Turan", "Richard Schickel", "Scott Nash", "Kim Newman", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "", "Leonard Klady"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spokesman-Review (Washington)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Three Movie Buffs", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety"], "date": ["February 21, 2018", "May 6, 2014", "May 6, 2014", "May 6, 2014", "May 6, 2014", "May 6, 2014", "March 20, 2013", "March 19, 2013", "March 19, 2013", "March 19, 2013", "March 19, 2013", "March 19, 2013", "March 19, 2013", "March 21, 2011", "March 16, 2011", "August 5, 2008", "August 5, 2008", "August 5, 2008", "August 5, 2008", "August 5, 2008"]}}
