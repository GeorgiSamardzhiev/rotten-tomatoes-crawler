{"metadata": {"synopsis": "As her teacher mother, Carolyn (Alfre Woodard), and her jazz musician father, Woody (Delroy Lindo), worry over monthly bills, grade-schooler student Troy Carmichael (Zelda Harris) banters and bonds with her four brothers. Against her will, Troy is sent to her aunt's southern home for a summer visit, but when she returns to her bustling Brooklyn neighborhood, she learns that a family member is gravely ill. Already mature, Troy is forced to face to some very grown-up facts about life and loss.", "rating": "77", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 52m", "director": "Spike Lee", "studio": "UniversalPictures,40Acres&amp;AMuleFilmworks", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 3, 2016", "box_office": "$12.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Apart from being the two female presences in the house, Carolyn sees singular fortitude and possibility in Troy.

In his most desperate moment, Lee shoots a long sequence through a distorted lens.", "Crooklyn, a gentle and touching tale of growing up in a melting-pot neighborhood of Brooklyn in the Partridge Family era, shows a different, more sentimental side of that cinematic firebrand, Spike Lee.", "", "Lee is a great self-promoter. After all his press releases and all his interviews, we are given films that are sketchy, unfelt and distancing -- incidents in Lee's career, the only drama that really interests him.", "While Lee fails to impose sufficient structure on his material, expertly drawn performances help vividly to evoke the family and street life of an era untroubled by crack or drive-by shootings.", "It's not Lee's most challenging work, but it's certainly amongst his most charming.", "A sub-par vision of Brooklyn with some bright spots", "An affectionate look at youthful adventures.", "The key problem is that the film is simply a ragged series of anecdotal sketches.", "Loosely based on Spike Lee's growing up in Brooklyn in the 1970s, the casual, warm, apolitical (for Lee) script took a life of its own during the development process.", "One of Lee's more modest but admirable pieces.", "Um dos melhores trabalhos de Spike Lee, este filme foi solenemente ignorado pela Academia - uma mancha que o Oscar carregar para sempre em seu histrico.", "Standard Spike Lee fare, which means it comes with its high and low points.", "Uneven Lee film -- and the reel printed in uncorrected 'scope is a really bad idea.", "An idiosyncratic domestic drama written and directed by Spike Lee", ""], "rating": ["", "4/5", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "B-", "", "3/4", "", "2/5", "4/5", "", "3/4", "3/5", "5/5", "3/5", "3/5", "", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Alyx Vesey", "Lynnette Nicholas", "Eve Tushnet", "Josh Larsen", "David Ansen", "Malcolm Johnson", "Owen Gleiberman", "Richard Schickel", "", "", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Michael A.
