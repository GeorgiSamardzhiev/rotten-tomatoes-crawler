[Full review in Spanish]", "It's based on the gripping three-character play by Ariel Dorfman.", "Even by their high standards, the performances of Weaver and Kingsley here are impressive, and Polanski ratchetts up the tension nicely. A chilling and thought-provoking piece.", "The material is well served by director Roman Polanski, who knows well how to instill a subtle, claustrophobic sense of dread in an audience and has put together a rather elegant potboiler.", "Polanski certainly gets the maximum voltage and precision out of his story and actors, keeping us preternaturally alert to shifting power relationships and delayed revelations.", "Kingsley shrewdly tantalizes the viewer about his identity, and gets to deliver the text's most riveting monologue at the end. The lesser-known Wilson may be the first among equals, impressing strongly as the equivocating husband.", "", "Polanski kicks the movie up to a level of emotional violence rare in English-speaking films.", "", "", "Polanksi's direction is crisp and precise but he doesn't resolve basic problems of the stage-to-screen transfer: The tale is claustrophobic (mostly limited to one set) and schematic, with all three characters serving as ideological mouthpieces.", "A relentless, superb thriller.", "Polanski wisely never opens out the action from the remote clifftop house. In keeping things claustrophobic, close-up and ambivalent, he heightens the suspense (not to mention the sexual tension).", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "rating": ["6/10", "B", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "4/5", "5/5", "4/5", "1/5", "B-", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Yasser Medina", "Dennis Schwartz", "Kim Newman", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Todd McCarthy", "Susan Granger", "Rob Gonsalves", "Neil Cohen", "Jake Euker", "Emanuel Levy", "Jeffrey M.
