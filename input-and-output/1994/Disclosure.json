{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this Michael Crichton adaptation, Tom Sanders (Michael Douglas) is a senior executive at a cutting-edge technology corporation on the verge of releasing an innovative new product. Sanders' boss, Bob Galvin (Donald Sutherland), is putting the final touches on a potentially lucrative merger and everything is in order for Tom until a vamp from his past, Meredith Johnson (Demi Moore), swoops in, stealing his impending promotion and then -- doubling down -- suing him for sexual harassment.", "rating": "59", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 7m", "director": "Barry Levinson", "studio": "WarnerBros.,ConstantcProductions,BaltimorePictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2008", "box_office": "$81.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Makes the case convincingly that women in power can sexually harass men that they manage.", "Douglas inspires little empathy, while Moore's character-a serial sexual harasser-is thinner than a microchip. And as a thriller, Disclosure is anticlimactic...", "Though directed with machine-like precision by Barry Levinson, the screenplay by Paul Attanasio unfortunately eliminates too many key elements in Crichton's smart but convoluted story line.", "Pure and simple trash masquerading as significance.", "Its preoccupation with snazzy computer-generated special effects has left key plot points so unclear at least one baffled viewer had to retreat to the book to find out why some things happened and others did not.", "The presence of Douglas, who has made a career of being pursued by beautiful, dangerous women, turns this sexual-harassment thriller into instant camp.", "This witty, wily battle between genders is not so much about sexual harassment as it is about power politics in the workplace, where water-cooler gossip is replaced by E-mail, and where memo warfare is waged by combatants in virtual-reality goggles.", "On the level of pure craft, Disclosure is first-rate in every department. Levinson's directing is cogent and colorful, and cinematography by camera wizard Tony Pierce-Roberts is dazzling.", "For those who would question Crichton's motives, Levinson and Attanasio haven't let men off the hook.", "This is the least personal movie [Levinson has] made in years, and the script is more a shortening of Crichton's story than a dramatization.", "If the best parts of Disclosure are its sideshows, its biggest drawback is that infernal infatuation the filmmakers have with technology and power.", "Douglas, with Fatal Attraction and Basic Instinct behind him, knows all about playing male victimization without total loss of amour propre. Moore's ferocity is totally unredeemed, therefore totally riveting.", "This is one of those big, sleek soulless movies that hums along, impressed with itself and the Big Issue it allegedly tackles... [but] what Disclosure really does best is appeal to your most prurient instincts.", "Moore models some slinky lingerie and Douglas soaks his collars in sweat, while the emphasis on computer gizmos and cyber-babble encourages a verdict of virtual rubbish.", "It soars because of the sizzling chemistry of Douglas and Demi Moore.", "Douglas makes for a sympathetic and wily hero.", "In this world of Information Highway sophistication and virtual-reality marvels, the pivotal plot points are all rickety coincidences: an overheard conversation, a fortuitous phone call.", "...watchable yet far-from-engrossing...", "Little more than another Hollywood sizzler, a highly melodramatic and perhaps opportunistic look at a couple of topical themes; that said, it's also a lot of fun.", "The impact of 'Disclosure' is weakened significantly by depiction of the female boss as a totally evil person."], "rating": ["B+", "", "2.5/5", "2/4", "", "", "3/4", "", "3/4", "2.5/4", "3/5", "", "", "2/5", "", "3/4", "", "2.5/4", "7/10", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Harvey S.
