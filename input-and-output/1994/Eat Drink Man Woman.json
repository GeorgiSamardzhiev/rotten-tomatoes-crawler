It's pleasing to the eye and stocked with zesty performances all the way around.", "The constant parallels between food and love are too facile to be illuminating.", "A richly textured comedy about the tensions across two generations of a Confucian family, Eat Drink Man Woman typifies the filial focus of Lee's early work", "A wise and touching piece that matches movies like Babette's Feast and Like Water for Chocolate in its depiction of food as a source of spiritual nourishment.", "What makes this a Lee film-and one of his best-is how well he and his co-writers understand all the relationships, and what's going unspoken.", "This is a startlingly superior piece of craftsmanship, with the flavour of life and richness of the script conveyed via uniformly wonderful performances.", "A vivacious comedy about families and how to survive them.", "Although the prime influence on Lee's stately style and several of the film's themes is the Japanese genius Yasujiro Ozu, there is more than a hint of Woody Allen in this complex ensemble comedy.", "What makes Lee's films so engaging is the generosity of spirit that he extends toward all of his characters.", "Lee's Eat Drink Man Woman is tender without being mushy, sweet without being syrupy -- and surprising in ways that can only make you smile.", "This film is stunningly involving, and it just races along from revelation to revelation.", "But by the end, I felt that Lee had, so to speak, stuck a little too closely to the recipe: His movie is moderately enjoyable in a been-there, done-that sort of way.", "Lee and his fine ensemble of actors will soon enfold you in a journey of delightful twists and turns. And in the end, a family you'll long remember.", "Eat Drink Man Woman may not just amuse and entertain you. It's likely to make you very hungry, too-perhaps for more than food.", "That guarantee of good taste is, finally, a bit of a downer; there are plenty of surprises, but no hint of risk.", "A remarkably assured comedy-drama of domestic life in Taiwan.", "Mildly charming."], "rating": ["2.5/5", "", "", "4.5/5", "", "4/5", "3.5/4", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "", "3/4", "3.5/4", "3/5", "", "3.5/4", "", "3.5/4", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "David Lamble", "Wendy Shreve", "Owen McNally", "Quentin Curtis", "Patrick Gamble", "Matt Brunson", "Noel Murray", "Angie Errigo", "Film4 Staff", "David Parkinson", "People Staff", "Steven Rea", "Stephen Hunter", "Jay Boyar", "John Dolen", "Michael Wilmington", "Anthony Lane", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bay Area Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Featuring Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent on Sunday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Skinny", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dissolve", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader"], "date": ["October 29, 2020", "June 8, 2020", "May 9, 2020", "January 29, 2019", "December 12, 2017", "September 1, 2015", "March 4, 2015", "March 2, 2015", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 3, 2014", "February 2, 2009", "February 2, 2009"]}}
