{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A beautiful young woman with unusually big thumbs, Sissy Hankshaw (Uma Thurman) decides, fittingly enough, to become a hitchhiker. After finding work as a model for feminine products, Sissy goes to shoot an ad at the Rubber Rose, a ranch owned by the Countess (John Hurt), the company's flamboyant cross-dressing head. While at the ranch, Sissy meets numerous other eccentric characters, including an outgoing and rebellious cowgirl named Bonanza Jellybean (Rain Phoenix).", "rating": "19", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Gus Van Sant", "studio": "NewLineCinema,FourthVision", "theater_date": "May 20, 1994", "dvd_date": "Mar 24, 2015", "box_office": "$1.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Gus Van Sant adapts Tom Robbins's comic, countercultural novel of the 70s... and while the results are both cheerful and occasionally inventive, they can't hold a candle to his previous features.", "Unlike the book, which retains some humanity amid philosophical digressions and flowery dialogue, Van Sant's film is cold and the gallery of eccentrics merely come across as vulgar caricatures.", "Though the director's sensibility worked extraordinarily well when applied to hard-edged subject matter like \"Drugstore Cowboy\" and even \"My Own Private Idaho,\" combining it with Robbins' flimsy jokiness has resulted in a film whose tedium is painful.", "Those interested in looking back in sorrow or amusement had better saddle up fast, because Cowgirls will be hitching out of town fast.", "Despite a few ecstatically beautiful sequences, it continues the wayward pretentious streak of Van Sant's last film, My Own Private Idaho, but not its affecting characters.", "There are just too many half-cooked ingredients in this utopian stew of a movie.", "Pic stays on the surface, without attempting any exploration of painful depths.
