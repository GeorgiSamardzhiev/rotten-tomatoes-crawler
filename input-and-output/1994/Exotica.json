{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the upscale Canadian strip club Exotica, Christina (Mia Kirshner) is the most popular dancer, and she's visited nightly by the obsessive Francis (Bruce Greenwood), a depressed tax auditor. Meanwhile, her ex-boyfriend, the club's MC, Eric (Elias Koteas), still jealously pines for her, even as he introduces her onstage. Eric is having his own relationship problems with the club's owner, Zoe (Arsin\u00e9e Khanjian), who is intent on becoming pregnant with his child.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Atom Egoyan", "studio": "MiramaxFilms,AllianceEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 19, 2012", "box_office": "$5.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Atom Egoyan makes his most conventionally-satisfying film in Exotica.
