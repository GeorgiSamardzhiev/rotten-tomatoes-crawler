{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Carlo (Stefano Dionisi) and Riccardo Broschi (Enrico Lo Verso) are a brother act: Ricardo is a composer who writes the music and Carlo a castrato who sings it beautifully. But Carlo is clearly the more talented of the two, and soon becomes wildly famous -- first in Italy and then throughout Europe -- as the legendary castrato Farinelli. Riccardo takes to managing his celebrity sibling, but, when the composer Handel (Jeroen Krabb\u00e9) begins working with Farinelli, Riccardo's resentment surfaces.", "rating": "58", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 50m", "director": "G\u00e9rard Corbiau", "studio": "ItalianInternationalFilm", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 23, 2019", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Farinelli is lush and theatrical in the way you'd expect a movie about an opera singer to be but, somehow, it's also dry and dull.", "While visually vibrant and generally well-acted, Farinelli is strangely not very compelling.", "", "This Oscar-nominated Belgian entry about catsration of boys who became phenomenal soprano opera singers is more bizarre than drmatically engaging, but the story is always fascinating and the movie nice to look at and listent to.", "", "", "", "Romantic, sweeping tale of sex and sibling rivalry that manages to connect despite its overwrought storytelling.", "Stops you in your tracks and transports you to a phantasmagorical world where music, mystery and magic hold sway.", "", "", "A lush, engrossing drama.", "Artistry abounds in every aspect of the film.", "Farinelli is great fun and sufficiently thoughtful and complex to give food for continuing thought.", "", "Musically thrilling.", "Because Carlo Broschi, the 18th-century castrato singer known as Farinelli, was himself such an exotic and sensationalistic figure, you'd think that creating a dull movie out of his flamboyant life would be next to impossible.
