{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This mock documentary follows sociologist Nina Blackburn (Kasi Lemmons) during the year she spends studying hip-hop artists Ice Cold (Rusty Cundieff), Tasty-Taste (Larry B. Scott), Tone Def (Mark Christopher Lawrence) and a series of disappearing white managers. Every rap clich\u00e9 is on display: sex, sexism, violent imagery and paint-peeling profanity -- all of it, the group insists, with a deeper political meaning -- plus the inevitable rivalry with other rappers and ultimately themselves.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Comedy/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 25m", "director": "Rusty Cundieff", "studio": "IncorporatedTelevisionCompany,OakwoodProductions", "theater_date": "Jun 3, 1994", "dvd_date": "Jun 27, 2018", "box_office": "$232.5K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It lampoons the luminaries, yes, but gives their authentic anger, which came from a real place, the benefit of gentler nudges. Its greatest fury lambastes losers who embraced a gangster rap ethos to build a bank account, not let loose a battle cry.", "", "Borrowing intelligently from This is Spinal Tap, writer-director-actor Rusty Cundieff has crafted a mock music documentary that is as irreverent, hilarious, and tough-minded as its model.", "The best hip-hop film of all.", "Inspired by This Is Spinal Tap, this mockumentary exposes the trials of a hardcore rap band, N.W.H. (Niggas With Hats) with wild, irreverent humor and exuberant music.", "While individual interviews, pop-video parodies and album titles hit the mark, the film as a whole is insufficiently clear-cut in its satire of the bands' dubious antics and attitudes.", "", "", "", "The rap scene has always had its share of colourful characters that are already caricatures. Why is there a need to spoof it?", "If Mr. Cundieff doesn't match the satirical genius of Mr. Reiner's film, he does understand the rules of the game.", "Satire at its finest. Uproarious and endlessly creative.", "", "It's like \"CB-4\" -- only funnier.", "As it recounts the history of N.W.H., the film also manages to lampoon rap music and its archetypes, as well as poking fun at the venal, self-serving music-business types looking to grab easy money from the scene.", "This movie is not tightly-scripted or elegantly produced, but it is (for the most part) highly entertaining. For those who have been waiting for a sequel to Spinal Tap, this may be the best alternative.", "Not as fearless and sharp-edged as it could be -- but it provides a lot of laughs, and barbecues a few sacred cows.", "There's no plot to speak of, just gag after gag. Rap fans will likely love most of it; all others, flip a coin.", "Cundieff is perhaps most adept at skewering rap's self-important politics through Ice Cold's wonderfully improbable explanations of how songs such as 'Booty Juice' actually contain an important social message.", "Fear of a Black Hat is not brilliant, but it's bright enough."], "rating": ["4/5", "B", "3.5/4", "3/4", "3/4", "", "3/5", "4/5", "4/5", "6", "3/5", "4/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3/4", "3/4", "3/4", "2.5/5", "8/10", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nick Rogers", "Owen Gleiberman", "", "Peter Travers", "Emanuel Levy", "", "Emanuel Levy", "Jeff Otto", "Sarah Chauncey", "Ryan Cracknell", "Janet Maslin", "Phil Villarreal", "Rob Vaux", "Scott Weinberg", "Michael Snyder", "James Berardinelli", "Roger Ebert", "Alvaro Rodriguez", "Scott Renshaw", "Richard Harrington"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Yap", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rolling Stone", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IGN Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Apollo Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arizona Daily Star", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flipside Movie Emporium", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Francisco Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ReelViews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Sun-Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Austin Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rec.arts.movies.reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post"], "date": ["May 30, 2014", "September 7, 2011", "December 17, 2007", "August 14, 2007", "June 30, 2006", "January 26, 2006", "June 28, 2005", "February 7, 2005", "June 4, 2004", "October 25, 2003", "May 20, 2003", "December 24, 2002", "July 26, 2002", "July 25, 2002", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000"]}}
