{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Fresh (Sean Nelson) is a 12-year-old drug dealer who finds himself trapped in a web of poverty, corruption and racial tension in Brooklyn, New York. When his drug-addict sister Nichole (N'Bushe Wright) starts sleeping with local drug lord Esteban (Giancarlo Esposito), Fresh calls upon the skills he learned playing chess with his alcoholic father and speed-chess champion Sam (Samuel L. Jackson) and devises a complex strategy that will free both himself and his sister.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 52m", "director": "Boaz Yakin", "studio": "Miramax", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 23, 2016", "box_office": "$7.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Screenwriter Boaz Yakin makes a stunning directorial debut with \"Fresh,\" the gripping, finely acted tale of a 12- year-old's life on the mean streets of New York.", "Though well acted, and handsomely shot by veteran Adam Holender, Fresh sacrifices real emotion for thriller contrivances. It's a tourist's drive through inner-city hell.", "The movie's two instincts are at complete odds with each other.", "Glibly shocking, it would like you to think it deals with the hard realities of urban life, but in fact it uses its patina of social consciousness as a come-on for the most conventional kind of violent commercial filmmaking.", "A gripping story of survival on the streets and survival of the soul.", "It's rigorous and quite depressing fare.", "The strength of the piece is that it realises which aspects of its genre have been seen too many times, always coming back to Nelson's blank but expressive stare as he watches terrible things the director doesn't need to shove in our faces.", "Sean Nelson is a quiet revelation as the title character, a child who actively participates in what he regards as the only game in town, yet consistently demonstrates more caution and smarts than his friends or relatives.", "The absence of moralising and macho posturing gives authenticity and poignancy to the film.", "The script by writer-director Boaz Yakin is fresh itself, marrying the physical violence of Fresh's world with the intellectual violence of competitive chess.", "[Fresh is] made with a subtle precision that suggests a Vermeer landscape of the ninth circle of hell.", "A hugely underrated crime drama, Fresh is worth discovering both for its air of authenticity and Sean Nelson's remarkable performance.", "This is kept alive largely through its first-rate performances, beginning with Sean Nelson's as the boy; Giancarlo Esposito is also a standout.", "Fresh appeals to the head as well as the heart.", "Sean Nelson, who turned 13 just before the film was shot, gives a fine, self-assured performance in the title role.", "An unpredictable and harrowing story that works on the surface as an unconventional thriller (an intricate plot) and underneath as a powerful story of love, sacrifice, willpower and the dehumanizing cost of violence and revenge.", "You may not believe a minute of it, though you won't forget Nelson's face.", "Yakin has put some powerful drama up on the screen, and he has been assisted by no one more significantly than young Nelson, who plays Fresh.", "", "Though its morality may be controversial, the film, an impressive debut from Boaz Yakin, deserves credit for introducing a new type of protagonist, a ghetto teenager willing to do everything and anything to escape his lot."], "rating": ["4/4", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "", "4/5", "3/4", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "4/5", "3.5/4", "B", "", "3/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Deborah Hornblow", "David Ansen", "Stephen Hunter", "Kenneth Turan", "Leah Rozen", "Candice Russell", "Kim Newman", "John Hartl", "Tom Hutchinson", "Gene Siskel", "Richard Corliss", "Richard Luck", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Carrie Rickey", "Jay Boyar", "Gary Thompson", "Owen Gleiberman", "Todd McCarthy", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "Emanuel Levy"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">FulvueDrive-in.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com"], "date": ["September 15, 2020", "March 4, 2019", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "April 21, 2015", "September 7, 2011", "July 6, 2010", "May 7, 2007", "July 4, 2006"]}}
