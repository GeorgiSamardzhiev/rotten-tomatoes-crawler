{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Con man Ray Gleason (Ted Danson) is going after one last heist -- a stash of rare coins -- when his estranged son, Timmy (Macaulay Culkin), unexpectedly shows up. Ray is too busy with his robbery to spend much time with his son, so Timmy decides to blackmail Ray into acting like a father. He hides the coins and promises to give them back only after Ray takes him to amusement parks and baseball games. All the while, Detective Theresa Walsh (Glenne Headly) is closing in on Ray.", "rating": "3", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Howard Deutch", "studio": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$18.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Macaulay Culkin is getting on a bit for a child star, but shows no sign of turning into a young actor in Getting Even With Dad.", "The film should have been a roller coaster ride; instead, watching it is like trudging through a swamp.", "The new summer movies don't get much more formulaic than this bald attempt to capture the audience that can't wait to see the next three or four installments of Home Alone.", "The feeble attempts at verbal and physical slapstick are so lacking in humour that they're embarrassing for both the players and audience.", "Howard Deutch is a proficient enough second division director, but here he allows sentimentality to run riot, and the awkwardly ageing Culkin (approaching adolescence) no longer possesses the mischievous charm of old.", "The film's greatest liability is Culkin, grown awkwardly out of his Home Alone cuteness into a Stepford Child star.", "When toddlers are tipping the punchlines, it's time for rewrite.", "This seems to be the work not of screenwriters but of Hollywood marketing executives who believe movies are popular because they tell audiences what they want to hear.", "It's all a bit smug and suspect.", "Culkin is Culkin, cute and malleable, absolutely empty, absolutely precious, absolutely irritating.", "It can't decide whether to be a mushy valentine to the dad-son relationship, masculine style, or a not-very-clever comedy.", "Tone: Home Alone-style slapstick with occasional (almost random) heart-tugging.", "Neither Macaulay Culkin nor Ted Danson has improved his luck in selecting projects with this schizophrenic comedy.", "A charming, amusing comedy for the whole family", "The script is formula and so is the direction, which leaves the acting.", "", "", "Perhaps blackmail isn't an easy subject to warm up to, or robbery the best ground to rebuild a relationship on, but with a little care, some added ingredients and a bit more spice, Getting Even With Dad could have been a satisfying [film].", "", ""], "rating": ["", "", "2/4", "1/5", "2/5", "1/4", "2/4", "0.5/4", "", "2/4", "", "2/5", "", "3/5", "", "2/5", "1/5", "2/4", "2.5/4", "0/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Lesley Thornton", "Caryn James", "John Hartl", "Jane Stefanski", "John Ferguson", "", "Gary Thompson", "Carrie Rickey", "Peter Rainer", "Stephen Hunter", "Candice Russell", "Jay Boyar", "Brian Lowry", "Caffeinated Clint", "Alistair Owen", "Emanuel Levy", "Rebecca Murray", "John Petrakis", "Neil Martin", "Jeffrey Westhoff"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent on Sunday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Moviehole", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">About.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Palo Alto Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Northwest Herald (Crystal Lake, IL)"], "date": ["November 30, 2017", "July 25, 2014", "May 28, 2013", "May 28, 2013", "May 28, 2013", "May 28, 2013", "May 28, 2013", "May 28, 2013", "May 28, 2013", "May 28, 2013", "May 28, 2013", "May 28, 2013", "July 6, 2010", "August 17, 2008", "June 24, 2006", "September 12, 2005", "October 29, 2003", "May 20, 2003", "May 20, 2003", "August 30, 2002"]}}
