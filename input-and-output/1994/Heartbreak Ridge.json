{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Marine Sgt. Thomas Highway (Clint Eastwood) is a decorated veteran of two wars. On his last posting before retirement, he is surrounded by officers with no combat experience who view him as an odd, even dangerous, holdover. Highway is assigned to train a group of undisciplined recruits including Cpl. Stitch Jones (Mario Van Peebles), a slick hustler who has previously encountered Highway. As the old soldier prepares his men for a war they don't believe will come, the U.S. invades Grenada.", "rating": "70", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "2h 9m", "director": "Clint Eastwood", "studio": "MalpasoCompany", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 1, 2008", "box_office": "$41.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There are no surprises in films like Heartbreak Ridge, only catharsis. Like war and contact sport, they release the pent-up aggression of adolescent males. Never mind the cliches, feel the muscle.", "There's a by-the-numbers feel to it all, but Eastwood is the main reason to watch, as he whips the troops into shape in readiness for the invasion of Grenada.", "The whole film seems ideologically forced and out of place, an attempt to resurrect the retentive virtues of Ford and Hawks without the cultural context that gave them expressive strength.", "''Heartbreak Ridge'' is a film of genuine substance and courage.", "Screenwriter Jim Carabatsos (yes, the very guy who wrote No Mercy) is a Vietnam vet. Yet he seems to have no idea of how men fight, get along or talk.", "An unusually thoughtful look (and a broad one) at powers on the wane, at America's shift from Vietnam polarisations to 80's apathy, and at one man teetering on the brink of a lonely old age.", "A film so uninvolving that you barely wake up for the big battle finale.", "A drama that gets you in totally without you ever realising it.", "What elevates the film are its dead-on verisimilitude about 1980s military culture, its lightly-worn insights into the larger issues at stake, and its precision-lathed dialogue, which is smart but never smarmy.", "Set during the Grenada War, Clint Eastwood's war movie is a formulaic, old-fashioned actioner wearing its ideology on its sleeves.", "Heartbreak Ridge offers another vintage Clint Eastwood performance.", "You may not always like Eastwood's films, but you seldom get downright bored by them.", "For a war film, Heartbreak Ridge is oddly lighter in spirit than many of Eastwood's other films from this period.", "The film belongs to Eastwood. Now looking increasingly like an Easter Island statue, he has a voice pickled in bourbon, a tongue like razor wire, and a body so full of shrapnel that he can't walk through airport metal detectors.", "Clint Eastwood is at his macho, insubordinate best in this exuberant, salty military movie with more memorable lines and funny moments than most comedies.", "", "", "", "", ""], "rating": ["", "3/5", "", "4/4", "", "3/5", "", "3/5", "", "C+", "", "6/10", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "6"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Daly", "Alan Jones", "Pat Graham", "Dave Kehr", "People Staff", "William Thomas", "Sheila Benson", "Leigh Paatsch", "Kyle Smith", "Emanuel Levy", "Variety Staff", "John J.
