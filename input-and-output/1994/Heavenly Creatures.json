{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Wealthy and precocious teenager Juliet (Kate Winslet) transfers from England to Christchurch, New Zealand, with her family, and forms a bond with the quiet, brooding Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) through their shared love of handsome big screen tenor Mario Lanza and games of make believe. But when their parents begin to suspect that their increasingly intense friendship is becoming unhealthy, the girls decide to run away to America, hatching a dark plan for those who threaten to keep them apart.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "Peter Jackson", "studio": "MiramaxFilms", "theater_date": "Nov 16, 1994", "dvd_date": "May 19, 2016", "box_office": "$870.8K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This is a film that cares about its subjects' point of views and lets us inside its subjects' point of views. The film begins and ends in blood but there are so many moments where the reality is tempting to forget.", "Jackson's signature visual flair has a lot of opportunity to display itself here. The girls' rich fantasy world is portrayed in an ingenious visual manner.", "With wit and daring, Jackson whisks us around two adolescent girls' minds, on a guided tour of their most garish fantasies and deluded, delirious dreams. Imagination is both the film's subject, and its strength.", "...a profoundly misguided endeavor that squanders a seemingly foolproof premise...", "It remains, two decades on, a vertiginous, surreal psycho-portrait of adolescent girlhood's dramas and despairs--Little Town on the Prairie gone Badlands.", "Gruesome yet imaginative teen psychosexual drama.", "The first Peter Jackson film to show his interests go beyond simply splatter and gore. Magical.", "Lynskey and Winslet are extraordinary actresses.", "The inner tension of the film emerges from Jackson's enjoyment of the girls' bustling insanity and then his gradual withdrawal from it.", "Combines original vision, a drop-dead command of the medium and a successful marriage between a dazzling, kinetic techno-show and a complex, credible portrait of the out-of-control relationship between the crime's two schoolgirl perpetrators.", "Unlike the campy excess of Jackson's earlier Dead Alive, deliberate overkill ltimately points toward a dearth of ideas rather than a surfeit.", "", "This incredible film may be director Peter Jackson's masterpiece.", "A dark, astounding film from Peter Jackson, showing his mastery of blending fact and fantasy. A deserved winner of Venice Festival's Silver Lion and Toronto Fest's Critics Award. Along with Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, this is 1994's most audacious film.", "Fantasy and reality blur in a chilling film that shows Jackson's limitless potential", "Acted with conviction, and directed and written with febrile vibrancy.", "The movie that first got Jackson & Winslet noticed", "", "", ""], "rating": ["", "", "", "2/4", "", "4/5", "", "B+", "5/5", "", "", "4/5", "3.5/4", "A", "4/5", "", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Drew Gregory", "Ed Travis", "Quentin Curtis", "David Nusair", "Brian Gibson", "Brian Costello", "", "Owen Gleiberman", "Rob Gonsalves", "David Rooney", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "John A.
