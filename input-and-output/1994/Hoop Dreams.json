{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Every school day, African-American teenagers William Gates and Arthur Agee travel 90 minutes each way from inner-city Chicago to St. Joseph High School in Westchester, Illinois, a predominately white suburban school well-known for the excellence of its basketball program. Gates and Agee dream of NBA stardom, and with the support of their close-knit families, they battle the social and physical obstacles that stand in their way. This acclaimed documentary was shot over the course of five years.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Documentary/Special Interest/Sports & Fitness", "runtime": "2h 54m", "director": "Steve James", "studio": "KTCAMinneapolis,KartemquinFilms", "theater_date": "Oct 14, 1994", "dvd_date": "Sep 30, 2016", "box_office": "$7.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's the film's humanity which is at the core of its genius. It takes its subject seriously. It never sneers or judges. It sees the context and is wise enough not to hold itself aloof.", "It's still a miraculous achievement that has rarely been emulated.", "At once a rigorous exploration of the sports-educational industrial complex and an intimate piece of portraiture...", "The film is rich in backstage tension, from Agee's bad grades to Gates's knee injuries, while the glaring social inequality is reflected in the violent fathers and criminal friends who populate the outskirts of the tale.", "Perhaps James's biggest achievement is his unshowy emphasis on the poetry of basketball itself: the jump shot, the slam-dunk, ecstatic physical expressions of pure transcendental success.", "It is impossible to watch this story of kids who have dreams of becoming rich and famous by way of professional basketball without a sense of nostalgia and even sadness.", "Utterly, heartbreakingly lucid.", "The film is a rare three-dimensional account of African-American lives and a stinging indictment of an educational system which, with its sports scholarships, institutionalises bribery.", "Hoop Dreams was declared a masterpiece early on, and decades later its prestige hasn't diminished one bit.", "... well worth your time for the up close and personal view it provides of how issues of race and class play out in the lives of these talented young men and their families.", "Steve James's remarkable example of cinma vrit tells the problematic journey of high school basketball stars William Gates and Arthur Agee, two African-American teenagers growing up in Chicago ghettos.", "", "It slam-dunks documentaries that are so close-up to their subjects they cannot note the irony of adult commercialism and hard-sell hoopla overwhelming barely literate kids.", "Epic is a word that suits Hoop Dreams well: The film seems to encompass not just a few individuals' stories, but draw archetypes out of them to personify the larger world around.", "Stunning documentary, great for older kids.", "It's about three hours long. But it moves like Isiah, fast and smooth, and it's over in a heartbreak.", "Hoop Dreams has shown us that the rules of the game are stacked against kids like Gates and Agee. Even better, it shows us how they fight back, with the inside moves of hope.", "The result not only follows the lives of the boys as they mature into men, suffering success and disaster along the way, but also provides a picture of tough inner-city life shorn of glamour or unnecessary melodrama.", "Ao acompanharem seis anos das vidas de sua dupla de protagonistas, James e sua equipe criaram um filme revelador, complexo e, acima de tudo, profundamente tocante.", ""], "rating": ["5/5", "5/5", "", "5/5", "5/5", "", "", "", "", "9/10", "A+", "A", "", "5/5", "5/5", "", "", "", "5/5", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["John Bleasdale", "Jordan M.
