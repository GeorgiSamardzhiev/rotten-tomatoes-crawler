{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Worn-down Peter Brackett (Nick Nolte) and ambitious Sabrina Peterson (Julia Roberts) are reporters working for rival newspapers. Assigned to cover a train derailment, the two journalists meet at the scene and immediately can't stand each other. But when they suspect a deadly government conspiracy behind the crash, the two rivals work together to break the story. While they expose corrupt scientists and butt heads every step of the way, Peter and Sabrina's competitive tiffs turn into romance.", "rating": "22", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Mystery & Suspense/Romance", "runtime": "2h 3m", "director": "Charles Shyer", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 22, 2016", "box_office": "$30.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["No one expects movies like this one, set as it is in the largely mythological world of fiercely competitive daily newspapering, to be realistic.

Not really. This by-the-numbers production is more like math than chemistry.", "It's like the worst possible Newman-Redford vehicle: the script reduces the stars to twinkling mannequins, and their chemistry barely rises to the buddy-buddy level.", "You can tell that they like each other by the way they hate each other. Shakespeare may have invented the recipe, Tracy and Hepburn may have refined it, but Nolte and Roberts certainly hold their own.", "The lack of chemistry onscreen allows the paper-thin premise to collapse in on itself, and there's very little else left to salvage.", "Roberts and Nolte seem to go together like oil and water, and the convoluted conspiracy-crime plot keeps them a lot more occupied than us.", "There's a pervasive romanticism in I Love Trouble that depends on the chemistry generated by Roberts and Nolte.", "The running badinage of Roberts and Nolte lacks the tartness and bite that made those classic couplings and the old screwballs crackle with contentious wit.", "If you can get your head round the idea of Julia Roberts as a ruthlessly ambitious newspaper reporter, then there's plenty to enjoy in this frivolous comedy thriller.", "Julia Roberts is the oddest of star commodities in Hollywood: a Lamborghini that few people know how to drive.", "The picture works, thanks in part to actual chemistry between Nolte and Roberts.", "Straight out of the His Girl Friday school of newspaper romances, Trouble is anemically formulaic and completely uninspired.", "Not even Roberts' trademark luminescence can save this one.", "Slick camera work and strong chemistry between the stars are almost enough to save the picture from terminal triteness, but not quite.", "The goings-on seem lacking in wit and inspiration, tolerably entertaining but far from effervescent.", "", "Age difference and lack of chemistry between Nick Nolte and Julia Roberts are just two of many problems that mar this pale imitation (really pastiche) of 40s screwball comedies by Howard Hawks and George Cukor."], "rating": ["", "3/4", "2/4", "1.5/4", "1/5", "", "3/4", "2/5", "", "", "1.5/4", "3/5", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "2/5", "D+"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Kenneth Turan", "Carrie Rickey", "John Hartl", "Gene Siskel", "Jay Boyar", "Michael Sragow", "Stephen Hunter", "Angie Errigo", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Candice Russell", "Dennis King", "David Parkinson", "Richard Corliss", "Gary Thompson", "Leah Rozen", "", "David Sterritt", "Todd McCarthy", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "Emanuel Levy"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">FulvueDrive-in.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com"], "date": ["June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "March 26, 2009", "May 7, 2007", "October 24, 2006"]}}
