{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This biography chronicles the life of infamous classical composer Ludwig van Beethoven (Gary Oldman) and his painful struggle with hearing loss. Following Beethoven's death in 1827, his assistant, Schindler (Jeroen Krabb\u00e9), searches for an elusive woman referred to in the composer's love letters as \"immortal beloved.\" As Schindler solves the mystery, a series of flashbacks reveals Beethoven's transformation from passionate young man to troubled musical genius.", "rating": "56", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 1m", "director": "Bernard Rose", "studio": "IconEntertainmentInternational", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$8.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Music scholars have challenged the film's authenticity, but they cannot dispute the magnificent image-making by director Bernard Rose.", "It may be a cartoon. Yet, with Beethoven's compositions crashing and storming around him, it's a cartoon that has some dark, harrowing grandeur.", "The results are always excessive and sometimes quite aggravating, but they're weirdly appropriate to the subject of the story, an over-the-top artiste who seemed excessive and aggravating to many of his 19th-century cronies.", "Despite Oldman's powers, this adds up to a less than immortal musical love story.", "Yes, this is another one of Hollywood's silly symphonies, an unintentionally amusing bit of piffle that allows mortals a privileged glimpse into the private life of a legendary composer.", "Ultimately, Beloved has all the sound and fury of Beethoven's music but none of its emotional resonance.", "Puffed up and pompous, but puny, this is a stodgy pudding of a film that moves at a snail's pace and tries unsuccessfully to accommodate wildly different performing styles from actors of various countries.", "Moments like these may lift Immortal Beloved high enough for even the most skeptical of purists to forgive it. Moments like these and, of course, all that glorious music.", "Immortal Beloved is pure historical hokum. Nevertheless, it is an absorbing motion picture and a heady blend of stellar performances, spectacular backdrops and crafty screenwriting.", "Da-da-da-DUMB!", "It's an audacious mixture of Citizen Kane and Amadeus, with some Fantasia-like musical sequences added for good measure. Indeed, cinema has rarely given classical music such a chance to weave its spell.", "Immortal Beloved is a lot like the famous sketch of Beethoven's study, made shortly after he died, showing a piano strewn with piles of junk and papers. It's a mess, but you know there has to be examples of Beethoven's genius in there somewhere.", "For all the story's illicit passion, creative reveries, detective-like investigation and twist ending, Immortal Beloved is episodically slow and surprisingly flat.", "A turgid affair with a palette that recalls used Ace bandages.", "There is an image in Immortal Beloved as evocative as any I can remember -- as complete as the sled in Citizen Kane, or the shadowy doorway in The Third Man.", "Kitsch, yes, but weirdly transporting. And the score is wonderful.", "For all the movie's faults, however, Rose does show now and then that he can create an inspired marriage of image and music.", "As biography, Immortal Beloved is trashy and fraudulent, yet as an impressionistic riff on Beethoven's temperament, his spirit, it exerts an irresistible pull.", "Occasionaly the hand of Hollywood crassness is reared, but there are moments of shrewd storytelling and some fine performances.", "Crucially, [director Rose] fails to drum up much suspense or even interest in the solution to the puzzle, poking a hole in his own balloon even before he fills it with air to try to make it fly."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "2.5/4", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "2/5", "", "", "2/4", "4/5", "3/4", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "B", "3/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Gene Siskel", "Michael Wilmington", "David Sterritt", "Malcolm Johnson", "Kenneth Turan", "People Staff", "Sky Staff", "Jay Boyar", "Roger Hurlburt", "Stephen Hunter", "David Parkinson", "James D.
