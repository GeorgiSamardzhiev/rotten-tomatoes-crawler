{"metadata": {"synopsis": "During a car accident, Vincent Eastman (Richard Gere) watches his whole life flash before his eyes, and he doesn't like what he sees. While maintaining the semblance of a marriage with his wife, Sally (Sharon Stone), Vincent has been carrying on with a mistress, Olivia (Lolita Davidovich). She's everything Sally isn't -- warm, passionate, carefree. So why can't he choose between the two, especially when his indecision is taking its toll on his daughter (Jenny Morrison) ?", "rating": "9", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Mark Rydell", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$20.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Sharon Stone and Lolita Davidovich's characters are essentially just nauseating ciphers built around Richard Gere's incredibly narcissistic and leniently portrayed architect.", "Intersection pretends to be a movie of grown-up, middle-aged concerns, but it plays like a rather dull and pointless soap opera.", "The American film is impatient with ideas, always seeking to wrap them in suspense or irony, and so smothering their force.", "Mark Rydell directs, often with a leaden hand, but the film is intriguingly structured and has the kind of bittersweet, double-edged ending too rare in mainstream Hollywood these days.", "", "Only Stone manages to find any emotional depth in her character, and that's not enough reason to see the film.", "It's a waxen, pretentious bore, and whatever chance it may have had of succeeding is foiled by casting so misguided that it's hard to imagine it wasn't meant as a vicious joke.", "Stone deserves some points for playing a recognizable human being while Davidovich fares less well in an underscripted part, but what sabotages the story altogether is Gere's boundless narcissism.", "This very loose adaptation (acknowledgement of the sources is buried in the end credits) attempts to goose things up here and there, but original's essentially meditative nature is left quite unfulfilled by the new approach and glamour cast.", "Less neurotic and sexually charged than usual, Gere digs deep to find the source of his character's chronic indecisiveness.", "", "", "", "", "", "Inane!", "", "Click to read review", "", ""], "rating": ["2/5", "", "", "", "C-", "", "2/4", "", "", "", "3/5", "2/5", "2/5", "1/5", "1/5", "C+", "1/5", "1/4", "1/5", "1.5/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["PJ Nabarro", "David Ansen", "Quentin Curtis", "Sheila Johnston", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Todd McCarthy", "", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "Emanuel Levy", "Philip Martin", "Nell Minow", "Thomas Delapa", "Dennis Schwartz", "Daniel M.
