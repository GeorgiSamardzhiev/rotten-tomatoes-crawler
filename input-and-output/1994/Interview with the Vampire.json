{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Born as an 18th-century lord, Louis (Brad Pitt) is now a bicentennial vampire, telling his story to an eager biographer (Christian Slater). Suicidal after the death of his family, he meets Lestat (Tom Cruise), a vampire who persuades him to choose immortality over death and become his companion. Eventually, gentle Louis resolves to leave his violent maker, but Lestat guilts him into staying by turning a young girl (Kirsten Dunst) -- whose addition to the \"family\" breeds even more conflict.", "rating": "64", "genre": "Horror/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Romance", "runtime": "2h 2m", "director": "Neil Jordan", "studio": "GeffenPictures", "theater_date": "Nov 11, 1994", "dvd_date": "Aug 15, 2008", "box_office": "$104.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A lavish adaptation of Anne Rice's novel with standout performances across the board and just the right amount of camp.", "Death keeps [Louis] human, fangs be damned.", "Cruise chews the scenery like it's covered in fried chicken skin, all but licking his fingers afterward.", "Director Neil Jordan has always had an affinity for underdogs, and he has created a film that can be viewed as empathetic to any oppressed group. Homosexuals may claim it as their emotional story", "This Golden Razzie Award-winner for Worst Screen Couple arrives dead and unmoving. And, mortal sin for the genre, it is not scary or campy.", "It's a glorified Jean Rollin vampire film that places sexual emphasis on blood sucking and vampirism...", "...the movie's aggressively overlong running time often does threaten to negate its positive attributes...", "Entertaining but gruesomely gory vampire tale.", "Beautiful to look at and dripping with atmosphere", "It's about seduction, and either you succumb to its inky entrapments or you resist. When its mojo was working, I was happy to be had.", "...something for everyone: heterosexuality, homosexuality, eroticism, murder, mayhem, pedophilia, necrophilia, nudity, gore.", "Why would Tom Cruise be playing Lestat, a gaunt, suave European vampire with a taste for young men? Because a big movie star can do whatever he wants.", "The leading performances, if acceptable, are not everything they needed to be to fully flesh out these elegant immortals.", "Holds plenty of interest, even for those who find Anne Rice's gothic cult novels unreadable.", "Jordan tries hard to inject some sort of Gothic sensibility into the film's early sequences, but it isn't until the third act, when the film enters the marvellously atmospheric world of the Thibtre des Vampires, that he really draws blood.", "Jordan is a master of poetic, deceptive atmosphere.", "Anne Rice was right the first time around when she criticized Tom Cruise's casting in public, and Brad Pitt is not great either but like every Jordan's film, this problematic adaptation has some merits such as child actress Dunst and some arresting images", "Given that this is basically a Reader's Digest condensed version, the movie does a pretty good sweep job.", "The major problem lies with Rice's own script, which is dramatically repetitive and philosophically banal.", ""], "rating": ["4/5", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "2.5/4", "3/5", "3.5/4", "", "5/10", "", "", "3/4", "", "5/5", "C+", "3/4", "", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Trace Thurman", "CJ Sheu", "Gena Radcliffe", "Gene Siskel", "Donald J.
