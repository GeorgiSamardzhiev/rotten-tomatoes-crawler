{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In early 20th-century Montana, Col. William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) lives in the wilderness with his sons, Tristan (Brad Pitt), Alfred (Aidan Quinn) and Samuel (Henry Thomas). Eventually, the unconventional but close-knit family encounters tragedy when Samuel is killed in World War I. Tristan and Alfred survive their tours of duty, but, soon after they return home, both men fall for Samuel's gorgeous fianc\u00e9e, Susannah (Julia Ormond), and their intense rivalry begins to destroy the family.", "rating": "58", "genre": "Drama/Western/Romance", "runtime": "2h 14m", "director": "Edward Zwick", "studio": "TriStarPictures,BedfordFallsProductions", "theater_date": "Dec 16, 1994", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$63.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Every wisp of wind carries some timbre of a guttural growl of passion.", "In general, director Edward Zwick does a commendable job of keeping things apace, while...

And the landscapes, photographed by John Toll, majestically backdrop all the personal and cultural furies.", "Everything about Legends of the Fall shouts epic filmmaking and it is not an altogether unpleasant sound.", "It either sweeps you up in its rapturous emotional wake or -- and it's a big or -- you just sit there and snicker. I found myself alternately doing both, though fortunately more of the former than the latter.", "Under such labored circumstances, James Horner's music must work overtime. It swoops and broods and promises you that something elemental about manliness is being conveyed.", "Tween girls will swoon over this tear-jerker.", "[Pitt] casts such a saintly, beatific sheen over the proceedings that he seems to glow from within.", "The part is a gift for Brad: he's a cowboy, soldier, adventurer and wanderer; impossibly glamourous and ludicrously far-fetched.", "Edward Zwick, the director, and Susan Shilliday and Bill Wittliff, the screenwriters, are under the impression that they are bringing forth a tragic epic, not a silly melodrama..."], "rating": ["4/5", "", "3/5", "", "2/4", "2/4", "", "3/5", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "2/4", "3/4", "", "", "C-", "3/5", "2.5/4", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Don Shanahan", "Duane Byrge", "PJ Nabarro", "Terrence Rafferty", "John Hartl", "Gary Thompson", "David Sterritt", "Jay Boyar", "John Ferguson", "Steven Rea", "Candice Russell", "Stephen Hunter", "Michael Wilmington", "Kenneth Turan", "Leah Rozen", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Afsheen Nomai", "", "", "Richard Schickel"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">25YL (25 Years Later)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine"], "date": ["December 4, 2019", "January 23, 2019", "December 2, 2018", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "September 7, 2011", "January 1, 2011", "August 14, 2009", "August 14, 2009", "August 14, 2009"]}}
