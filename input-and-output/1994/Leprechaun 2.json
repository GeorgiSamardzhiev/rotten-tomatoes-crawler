{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A leprechaun (Warwick Davis) surfaces in Los Angeles to claim a bride, as his previous object of affection was denied to him a thousand years before in Ireland. He kidnaps teenager Bridget (Shevonne Durkin), grotesquely murdering anyone who gets in his way. It falls to Bridget's boyfriend, Cody (Charlie Heath), to rescue her. Cody enlists the aid of his perpetually tipsy uncle, Morty (Sandy Baron), who decides to go after the homicidal leprechaun's pot of gold.", "rating": "6", "genre": "Comedy/Horror", "runtime": "1h 25m", "director": "Rodman Flender", "studio": "PlanetProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Leprechaun 2, unlike the bland original film, contains a lot of the things you would want to see in a horror movie about an evil leprechaun.", "The sequel fails to make the leprechaun a valid monster in his second outing, and fares no better in the later films.", "Awfully stupid, but at least it lacks as many outrageous contrivances and detours as the original had.", "This malevolent little horror item is a nasty piece of business that revels in chicanery and gore.", "i still hate leprechauns", "", "", "Destroys all continuity from its amusing predecessor.
