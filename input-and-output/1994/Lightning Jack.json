{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After being taken hostage in a botched bank robbery, the mute Ben Doyle (Cuba Gooding Jr.) has inadvertently become Sancho Panza to the quixotic Lightning Jack Kane (Paul Hogan), who fancies himself a legendary Wild West outlaw. While Jack teaches Ben how to shoot, ride a horse and perform a successful heist, he's also being pursued by a posse of vigilantes. Finally seeing the writing on the wall, Lightning Jack wants to make one last score and retire, but a rival gang isn't making it easy.", "rating": "6", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Television/Western", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Simon Wincer", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$15.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "Politically incorrect jokes (endlessly) about hearing impaired (Gooding) make for tasteless flick.", "It's a long slow trek from gag to gag.", "The relationship between Ben and Jack never really develops any warmth or resonance, mainly because it seems never to have been thought through.", "A good-natured, if laconic, oater that rides along nicely on the screen persona of writer/actor Paul Hogan.", "", "", "", "The film has no internal comic rhythm to match its faltering sense of humor.
