{"metadata": {"synopsis": "As Viktor Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh) is dying he shares a tale of gruesome terror with a sea captain. Viktor, using previous experiments by a brilliant scientist, was able to bring a creature (Robert De Niro) assembled from body parts back to life. Once he realized how destructive his experiments had become, he abandoned the creature and tried to live a normal life with his fiance (Helena Bonham Carter). The lonely creature seeks out Viktor and demands one of two things: a bride or revenge.", "rating": "38", "genre": "Horror", "runtime": "2h 3m", "director": "Kenneth Branagh", "studio": "TriStarPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 26, 2013", "box_office": "$22.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Branagh's version is too respectful and ultimately, well, lifeless.", "They're calling it \"Mary Shelley's Frankenstein,\" but, with apologies to the former rock group, \"Frankie Goes to Hollywood\" is more like it.", "Sumptuous to look at, with some decent performances...", "In attempting to keep faith with the original novel, Branagh concentrates too much on design and content, and loses the heart and soul of the story in the process.", "Branagh is very obsessed with chewing the scenery. So much so that he even manages to outdo Robert DeNiro.", "Branagh's ambitious take succeeds as a cautionary tale about true monstrosity: hubris and man's inhumanity to man. But one man's operatic style is another man's unintentionally comical excess, and...Frankenstein certainly tempts fate... [Blu-ray]", "Clearly, one person's authentic homage is another person's overwrought teeth-gnashing fest, as Branagh's film never hesitates to slop on the melodramatic mustard.", "I'm inclined to give it an 8 now. The more you watch, the more you appreciate how Branagh was able to faithfully retell Shelley's novel while still managing to make it fresh and make it relevant.", "Uma das mais fiis e complexas adaptaes da histria original, respeitando seus temas principais mesmo que desviando-se, aqui e ali, de pontos especficos da trama.", "Kenneth Branagh has indeed created a monster, but not the kind he originally envisioned.", "Watching the movie work itself into an operatic frenzy, one remains curiously detached: the grand gestures are there, but where's the music?", "Different look at the old Frankenstein story, directed by Branagh.", "A weirdly muddled and embarrassingly over-the-top fiasco.", "A sub par effort on one of the most frequently ill adapted stories ever made", "For all its attention to detail and special effects, this version lacks the pathos and tragedy in the complex and ambivalent relationship between the father-creator and his creature-monster; De Niro is misguided by director Branagh.", "", "It's Greek tragedy, and when its characters utter invocations to the gods in turn, it manages to feel cheesy in exactly the right way.", "Not frightening, just silly.", "", ""], "rating": ["2/4", "", "3/5", "2/5", "", "3/4", "6", "8/10", "5/5", "", "", "3/5", "2/5", "2/5", "C", "2/5", "2.5/4", "", "2/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Gene Siskel", "Kenneth Turan", "Angie Errigo", "Tom Hutchinson", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Peter Canavese", "Brian Webster", "James Plath", "Pablo Villa\u00e7a", "Variety Staff", "David Ansen", "Steve Crum", "Rob Gonsalves", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Emanuel Levy", "Boyd van Hoeij", "Walter Chaw", "Derek Adams", "Daniel M.
