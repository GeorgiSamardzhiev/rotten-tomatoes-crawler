{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Monsieur Verdoux (Charles Chaplin) is a dapper Parisian family man who loses his job as a bank clerk. In order to support his wife and child, he devises a plan to woo and marry rich widows under a variety of aliases, then murder them for their money. His scheme works until his 14th victim, the loud-mouthed Annabella Bonheur (Martha Raye), proves impossible to kill, and he takes pity on a beautiful but down-on-her-luck prostitute whom he was going to test a poison on.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama/Special Interest", "runtime": "2h 3m", "director": "Charlie Chaplin", "studio": "UnitedArtists", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 23, 2017", "box_office": "$60.6K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Henri Verdoux showcased Chaplin's crisp, flamboyant diction by playing against type. Never before had he played a deceitfully murderous man, slyly articulate and devilishly selfish in his conquest for corpses.", "It's quite a conundrum: a Chaplin comedy-drama that only resembles one after halfway into the plot.", "Its merit, to be crisp about it, is uneven. It has intervals that are highly entertaining. These occur when Chaplin reverts to type, the talented entertainer. It has other passages when it is nothing more than a pious, profound bore.", "Monsieur Verdoux is an acerbic and intelligent movie that remains unique for the public of our era. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The film's cynical vision is as lucid as it is unrelenting.", "a pitch-black, arguably bitter comedy that wasn't so much a departure for Chaplin (he had, after all, lampooned Hitler in his previous film) as it was an opportunity to fully engage with his darker comedic impulses", "Simultaneously ethical and unethical, the snappily dressed Verdoux exists as an extraordinary challenge to capitalism's status quo during its seismic swing toward fascism.", "Monsieur Verdoux can boast a screenplay with a highly unusual moral complexity and a deeply philosophical bent...Yes, Verdoux is a film that name-drops Schopenhauer, but it's also damn funny... [Blu-ray]", "Thoungh misunderstood and a commercial flop in 1947, Chaplin's murderous satire has many merits, including Oscar nomination for Original Script.", "", "It's not often you find Charlie Chaplin in the rare role of a villain, but he does nice work in this small tale of lies and murder.", "", "Perfection? Arguably not; Verdoux has clunky moments and some flat casting, but with an able assist from the great comedian Martha Raye, Chaplin's latter-day greatness is readily apparent.", "In its uncanny depiction of a weakling whose crimes pale against those of the war-mad society around him, it's a near masterpiece.", "Chaplin generates little sympathy. His broad-mannered antics, as a many-aliased fop on the make for impressionable matrons.", "As it is, Monsieur Verdoux is a curiosity with flashes of brilliance, but definitely not one of Chaplin's best.", "", "Gives one a greater sense of Chaplin's political breadth from his previous work.", "Shapes up as Chaplin's most startling, most invigorating movie: its icy temperature is positively bracing after the hot syrup of his earlier work.", "The intensely felt social criticism that audiences had seen growing in Modern Times and especially The Great Dictator is elevated to an astonishing level of sarcasm and subversive irony."], "rating": ["", "7/10", "", "", "1", "3/4", "A+", "4/4", "B+", "5/5", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "", "", "4/4", "5/5", "A-", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jordan M.
