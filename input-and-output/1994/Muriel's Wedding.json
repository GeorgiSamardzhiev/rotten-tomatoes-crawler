{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Socially awkward Muriel Heslop (Toni Collette) wants nothing more than to get married. Unfortunately, due to her oppressive politician father (Bill Hunter), Muriel has never even been on a date. Ostracized by her more socially adept friends, Muriel runs into fellow outcast Rhonda Epinstalk (Rachel Griffiths), and the two move from their small Australian town to the big city of Sydney, where Muriel changes her name and begins the arduous task of redesigning her life to match her fantasies.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "P.J.

Visually, Muriel's Wedding is a bustling blend of wry humor and acerbic social satire.", "There's a high enough feelgood factor here to compensate for the detours off the comedy highway.", "This movie only shows true tact and understanding when it comes to flattering the audience; everyone on-screen is strictly up for grabs.", "Another kooky Australian movie this may be, but director Hogan and his cast sustain a strange melancholic undercurrent.", "The trouble with the movie is that there's nothing to Muriel but her false dreams: We never quite glimpse the woman they're hiding.", "Most of the action is played for broad laughs, and Hogan demonstrates the ability to generate them, even if the humor is base and often cruel, making fun of people's looks and ineptitude.", "An engaging, funny and sometimes surprisingly tough romantic comedy.", "", "", "", "", "", "Enjoyable little film that nonetheless already feels overrated.", "", "", "", "Soulfully explores a young woman's journey to transformation", "[A] gleeful, gaudy tribute to one ungainly misfit and her determination.", "", "One of the finest Australian films of all time.
