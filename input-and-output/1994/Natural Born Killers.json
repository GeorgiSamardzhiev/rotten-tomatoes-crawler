It has the scathing exaggeration of satire, without the point and bite which make us recognise the real world. It flies off into its own realm of sadistic fantasy.", "It can easily be said that \"Natural Born Killers\" ranks among the worst films in Oliver Stone's filmography. It's an incompetently-made attempt at drilling home an incredibly simplistic point that anyone can learn from turning on the news.", "It plays like a mad dash across the cerebral mind-field in search of the right mood, and fails drastically at finding one.", "", "At times with this movie the art overpowered the film.", "Bloody, violent, sexually explicit.
