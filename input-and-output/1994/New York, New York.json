I'm not talking about Minnelli's final number. What's smashing is the ending to the De Niro-Minnelli romance. It has just the right mixture of old and new..", "If you can sit through 30 interspersed minutes of trivialities, New York, New York emerges victoriously as the musical of the year, and reaffirms Liza Minelli's position as one of the top musical stars, as well as talented actress, on the screen.", "Most rewardingly, [it] seems to have effected a kind of opening-out-allowing Scorsese to tackle material more experimentally than in Alice, the characteristic extremes of emotion without the over-determined mechanisms of Taxi Driver.", "The look and sound of 'New York, New York' may rapturously bring to mind any number of postwar MGM marvels. But its mood suggests outtakes from a scorching psychodrama, rushes from a documentary of a couple imploding.", "New York, New York, like most Martin Scorsese films, is about the trials and glories of making art.", "If lesser talents were involved, we might consider New York, New York quite passable entertainment, a pleasant collage of old musical movies. But with Scorsese, De Niro and Minnelli on the marquee, we expect more.", "What makes it such grand entertainment is the music, the costumes of the '40s and two dynamite performances.", "New York, New York is not the lively and brilliant film it should have been. It is rather a vague and drawn-out story. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The planning and staging of Scorsese is as brilliant as ever, but the vital vicissitude of these characters remains a mere anecdote. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Martin Scorsese's musical saga \"New York, New York\" is the keenest disappointment of the summer.", "Though affectionate and colorfully stylized, Scorsese's tribute to the darker classic Hollywood musicals is only partially successful...an interesting feature that ultimately fails as a period piece or dark musical.", "Ultimately a very personal film about how Scorsese views a genre of film and, as such, has a much more coherent vision than its reputation would suggest. [Blu-ray]", "A stagebound valentine, but one vigorously constructed down to the last detail, with Scorsese reveling in the costumes and music. It's an itch that spreads into a full-body rash in the final act.", "A downbeat homage to bright-lights showbiz dramas, an epic orchestration that indulges in stubbornly obsessive riffs, Martin Scorsese's New York, New York (1977) seems to value awkwardness and indecision above all else.", "Embora interessante, a direo de arte acaba se tornando uma distrao e os nmeros musicais so, em sua maioria, frouxos. Por outro lado, De Niro e Minnelli criam personagens complexos que despertam a curiosidade do espectador. Um Scorsese menor.", "A visually fascinating rumination on the genre.", "If this movie were a big-band arrangement, it would be a duet for a sax man and a girl singer, but with the soloists in a different key from the band.", "In a final burst from Old Hollywood, Minnelli tears into the title song and it's a wowser.", "It's the exact kind of craziness that could only have been made in the waning days of the 1970s.", ""], "rating": ["3.5/4", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "", "", "C+", "3.5/4", "B", "", "3/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "8/10", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Gene Siskel", "David MacDonald", "Richard Combs", "Melissa Anderson", "Chuck Bowen", "Bernard Drew", "Ruth Batchelor", "Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos", "Adrian Massanet", "Gary Arnold", "Emanuel Levy", "Peter Canavese", "Brian Orndorf", "Dan Callahan", "Pablo Villa\u00e7a", "", "Christopher Porterfield", "Variety Staff", "Tim Brayton", "Cole Smithey"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Gay News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sight and Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">4Columns", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slant Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gannett News Service", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Free Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Groucho Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">BrianOrndorf.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">House Next Door", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema em Cena", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com"], "date": ["June 19, 2020", "May 27, 2020", "February 6, 2020", "January 31, 2020", "January 28, 2020", "November 1, 2019", "October 23, 2019", "July 26, 2019", "January 8, 2019", "May 5, 2017", "March 6, 2012", "June 24, 2011", "June 24, 2011", "June 16, 2011", "January 27, 2010", "January 26, 2010", "January 26, 2010", "March 26, 2009", "April 13, 2008", "October 20, 2007"]}}
