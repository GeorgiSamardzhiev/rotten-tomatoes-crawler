{"metadata": {"synopsis": "North (Elijah Wood) is a talented and bright kid, but his mom (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) and dad (Jason Alexander) are utterly preoccupied with other things in their lives, leaving him largely ignored. Advised by a mysterious man (Bruce Willis) who pops up on occasion, North decides to legally separate himself from his parents and goes on a search across the globe for the ideal mother and father.

All the children in it, including Elijah Wood as North, seem over-directed, reacting with programmed cuteness.

How about a Hawaiian who lives near a beautiful beach?", "The amalgams of TV stereotypes that satirize foreign and regional cultures are embarrassing.", "There's schmaltz a-plenty and the odd, rare laugh but even the normally dependable Wood lacks enthusiasm.", "The screenplay by Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman packs more on-target social satire than any film in recent memory, and zesty performances keep it clicking along at a rapid pace.", "Unfunny. Boring. Endless.", "Unfortunately, although Zweibel and Reiner have crafted a fascinating parable, they have failed to make a successful film.", "It's a prime example of what can happen when hip, slightly cynical establishment filmmakers try to make a deeply sentimental movie.", "How could director Rob Reiner, whose touch for what pleases a mass audience is usually unfailing, have strayed this far?", "It's rather surprising to note that - for its first half, at least - North is actually quite engaging and entertaining...", "The intrinsic failure of Alan Zweibel and Andrew Scheinman's script is that it tips its hand from the start.", "Reiner is undecided just how fantastically he should treat this ludicrous plotline. Added to which there's a dire musical number, a silly thriller subplot, and much maudlin didacticism from narrator Willis in various guardian angel (dis)guises. Misery.", "", "", "\"North\"?
