{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Flustered college student Carol (Debra Eisenstadt) visits John (William H. Macy), one of her professors, and asks how she can pass his class. The narcissistic instructor barely seems to notice her presence, and goes off on tangents relating to his own personal philosophies and problems while failing to answer the pupil. Later, a more assured Carol returns and accuses John of sexual harassment. The professor is baffled, but Carol remains steadfast in her claim, and their feud escalates nastily.", "rating": "53", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 29m", "director": "David Mamet", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 6, 2018", "box_office": "$120.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Oleanna is less fanciful.
