{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Forrest Taft (Steven Seagal) is putting his considerable talents as a fighter and marksman to use as a hired gun for the sleazy oil tycoon Michael Jennings (Michael Caine). The latter's bottom-line tunnel vision has him destroying entire communities if it means a bigger profit for his business. While in Alaska taking care of some business for his amoral boss, however, Taft meets a native Eskimo woman (Joan Chen) who helps him to discover the error of his ways and pursue a more righteous path.", "rating": "9", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Steven Seagal", "studio": "WarnerBros.,Seagal/NassoProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 2, 2009", "box_office": "$36.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's a very interesting movie. Not good, mind you. But genuinely interesting.", "This is more than just a vanity project for Seagal. It's also his first real stinker. It would not be his last.", "What a Renaissance Man, that Steven Seagal. He lumbers, he sermonizes, he directs!", "Unfortunately Seagal, who also makes his directing debut with this script, is no match for Caine. His on-screen personality is petulant and humorless, his voice so grating you want to reach for a mute button.", "They may have to write a new book of Ecclesiastes to account for this one: the old \"Vanity of Vanities, All is Vanity\" just doesn't go far enough.", "The fuzzy thinking allows for gorgeous outdoor photography and a few too many dead spots, but Seagal the director shows real muscle by staging one of the screen's best-ever exploding helicopters.", "On Deadly Ground is a pip. Beautifully photographed by Ric Waite and handsomely produced, it surely is the most ambitious and the best Seagal movie to date.", "Although you could certainly wish that Seagal and his writers... could have found less preachy ways to express themselves, On Deadly Ground is otherwise lively entertainment for action fans.", "Seagal the director shows that he has picked up the odd trick or two from the action specialists who made his name, but his impassioned green speeches will have viewers reaching for the remote control.", "''I didn't want to resort to violence. I didn't have a choice,'' [Seagal] says; a greater man might have said, ''Make my day.''", "This is a vanity production parading as a social statement.", "As a performer, Seagal is singularly lacking in grace and charisma. As a director, he more than lives up to his ham-fisted acting.", "In contrast to his short, sharp fighting style, Seagal's presentation of the human conflicts and underlying issues consists of vague, sweeping gestures.", "", "", "", "A vanity project in the strongest sense of the term, this film has it all: bad acting, bad writing, bad direction, bad action sequences.", "", "", "You can't preach about preserving the environment and make movies full of sludge."], "rating": ["2/4", "", "1.5/4", "1.5/4", "0/4", "3/5", "", "", "3/5", "F", "", "2/4", "", "2/5", "2/5", "1/5", "0/4", "1/5", "2/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Matthew Rozsa", "Patrick Bromley", "Carrie Rickey", "John Hartl", "Stephen Hunter", "Kim Newman", "Roger Hurlburt", "Kevin Thomas", "John Ferguson", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Leonard Klady", "", "Nigel Floyd", "Emanuel Levy", "Caffeinated Clint", "Chris Barsanti", "Michael Dequina", "Mike McGranaghan", "Ryan Cracknell", "Janet Maslin"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">matthewrozsa.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">F This Movie!", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Moviehole", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmcritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieReport.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Aisle Seat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Views", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times"], "date": ["December 25, 2020", "April 23, 2020", "September 5, 2014", "September 5, 2014", "September 5, 2014", "September 5, 2014", "September 5, 2014", "September 5, 2014", "September 5, 2014", "September 7, 2011", "February 25, 2009", "February 25, 2009", "January 26, 2006", "July 14, 2005", "May 6, 2005", "September 14, 2004", "January 1, 2004", "September 4, 2003", "August 19, 2003", "May 20, 2003"]}}
