Schaffner has succeeded in making a two-and-a-half-hour film that seems like six.", "But Dustin Hoffman produces a splendid depiction of cunning corruption that acts as a perfect balance to McQueen's superstar charisma.", "Schaffner, who expertly captured the gritty story of Patton, does not flinch from showing every conceivable horror of the French penal system.", "Papillon was not a complicated man but his experiences changed him almost beyond recognition, and McQueen does a good job of portraying the survivor, broken in body, but not in spirit.", "This consummate prison-break epic features Steve McQueen's greatest transformation of character creation over the course of his estimable film career.", "The narrative unfolds slowly, but the two stars are compelling and cinematographer Fred Koenekamp's photography is striking.", "The script is very good within its limitations, but there is insufficient identification with the main characters.", "A rousing drama of endurance, opportunism and friendship under fire.", "Based on the memoirs of Henri Charriere, the only man to have successfully escaped from Devil's Island, this is a grim and brutal prison drama, made more likable due to the lead star performances.", "With Schaffner unable to find the necessary perspective to prevent the film from becoming unevenly episodic, it ends up looking as if it were tacked together by at least three different directors.", "", "", "A big, brave, stouthearted, sometimes romantic, sometimes silly melodrama with the kind of visual sweep you don't often find in movies anymore."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "", "A+", "7/10", "", "", "B", "", "3/5", "5/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Judith Crist", "John Hofsess", "John Simon", "Dick Lochte", "Kevin Maher", "Barbara Shulgasser", "Richard Schickel", "Don Druker", "David Parkinson", "", "Christopher Hudson", "Cole Smithey", "John J.
