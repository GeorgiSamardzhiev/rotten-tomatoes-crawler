{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After college, Lelaina (Winona Ryder) films a documentary about herself and friends as they flounder in their attempts to forge relationships and begin careers. Vickie (Janeane Garofalo) works retail, has an endless string of one-night stands and awaits the results of her HIV test. Sammy (Steve Zahn) tries to come out to his parents. Lelaina gets involved with yuppie Michael (Ben Stiller) while maintaining a love-hate relationship with Troy (Ethan Hawke), who's undergoing an existential crisis.", "rating": "66", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Ben Stiller", "studio": "JerseyFilms,UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "Feb 18, 1994", "dvd_date": "Dec 30, 2015", "box_office": "$20.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...a fairly by-the-numbers setup that's employed to impressively compelling (and relatable) effect by first-time filmmaker Stiller...", "The deeper themes of choosing art and integrity over earning a living . . . felt phony and hollow then, and are nothing short of embarrassing to watch from a modern perspective now.", "Reality Bites is a legitimately good movie.", "A lot has changed between the generations, but Reality Bites asks a question that anyone, of any age, will find familiar: what happens when the life you were promised isn't the life you got?", "In a picture full of painful moments, it's hard to decide on the lowest point.", "Written with verve and played with grace, Reality Bites is too smart to pass itself off as a definitive statement, but it gets the details delightfully right.", "Gone is the fearless savagery Stiller smuggled into his TV series. Stuck between slacker and attacker, he settles for something curiously inert, slavishly mainstream and so hopelessly phony its own characters might make fun of it between bong rips.", "Ryder and Hawke bring crucial authenticity to their roles with effortless appeal. You'll find yourself wanting more of these characters than the movie gives you.", "For all its faults, this still has moments of hip charm.", "The screenplay by newcomer Helen Childress falls back on familiar formulas too often, but first-time director Ben Stiller keeps the action fast and involving even when you can't help guessing what the next story twist will be.", "The smart script by 23-year-old newcomer Helen Childress doesn't lose sight of the characters and the issues that affect them and other young adults.", "However conventional Reality Bites resolves to be, it is always engaging. Best of all, Ryder has her greatest role since Heathers, once again proving herself a seriously funny young actress.", "The best -- the brilliant -- bits of Reality Bites etch in epigram, anecdote and brittle, dazzling dialogue the inner life of young people who want desperately to believe but haven't decided in what.", "It's a good example of an anti-establishment comedy crippled by a seeming desire to infatuate the establishment itself. What Reality Bites needs most is a good bite. From reality.", "Among the movie's strengths are the performances, especially that of Ryder, who comes across as bright, beautiful and more delicate than ever before.", "When the movie is over, you don't feel as if you had shared the experience of a new generation; you feel puzzled and vaguely crummy, as if you had just read a solemn news-magazine cover story about it.", "Yearning, hilarious, lost within their precocious self-awareness, these slackers have soul.", "Comedy about 20-something slackers isn't for kids.", "Remember Gen X? This is why you forgot it.", "A surprisingly sweet romantic comedy debut from Ben Stiller."], "rating": ["3/4", "", "", "", "", "", "1.5/5", "2.5/4", "", "", "3.5/4", "3/4", "3/4", "2.5/4", "", "", "A", "3/5", "2/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Nusair", "Gena Radcliffe", "Britt Hayes", "Clarisse Loughrey", "Noel Murray", "David Ansen", "Nick Rogers", "Jeff Shannon", "David Parkinson", "David Sterritt", "Mark de la Vi\u00f1a", "Carrie Rickey", "Stephen Hunter", "Michael Wilmington", "Jay Boyar", "Terrence Rafferty", "Owen Gleiberman", "Joyce Slaton", "Cole Smithey", "Angie Errigo"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spool", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Birth.Movies.Death.", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Yap", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine"], "date": ["June 17, 2020", "January 18, 2020", "August 3, 2019", "August 3, 2019", "August 3, 2019", "February 15, 2018", "February 25, 2014", "August 28, 2013", "August 28, 2013", "March 27, 2013", "March 27, 2013", "March 27, 2013", "March 27, 2013", "March 27, 2013", "March 27, 2013", "March 27, 2013", "September 7, 2011", "January 2, 2011", "October 12, 2008", "May 9, 2008"]}}
