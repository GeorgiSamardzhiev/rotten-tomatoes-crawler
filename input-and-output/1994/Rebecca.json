In the end, viewers may feel like the new Mrs. de Winter and want to get away from Manderley in any way possible.", "This is not the 1940 Oscar-winning Alfred Hitchcock Rebecca, nor does it want to be; rather, it's a new adaptation of the novel.", "Like the story's female protagonist the new version of Rebecca is haunted, this time by the ghosts of the story's previous incarnations.", "It's not reaching the level of excellence that Hitchcock made, but this version of Rebecca is a bright new interpretation, ripe for a new audience to discover today.", "Though Ben Wheatley makes three different movies here, it mostly works out the favor of the film so long as you don't compare it to the original.", "Lily James and Armie Hammer are very pretty and easy on the eyes. Also easy to look at are the gorgeous landscapes and exquisite costumes. That might be enough for some, just not me.", "It's a real shame that this nonsense movie is going to be the reference that new generations have of a classic like Rebeca. [Full review in Spanish]", "Never before has an adaptation misunderstood the source material to this extent. Worst of all: it's boring.", "As the narrative's haunted romance unfolds, Wheatley ratchets up the tension and, towards the end, pulls off a thrilling piece of plotting that would make the Master of Suspense himself sit up in admiration.", "It's not an awful film, just a perfectly acceptable one. Cinematic wallpaper.", "This is a melodramatic tale of class disparity and imposter syndrome and compulsive jealousy and explosive fury, and the execution here is just ... tepid. Lukewarm.", "Rebecca is a straightforward adaptation of a story already well told by a master, and one that, in side-stepping the previous adaptation, is left with very little to do.", "What is meant to be a suspenseful yarn soon starts to feel more like dull, drawn-out melodrama.", "There's an embarrassing lack of freshness in this remake that will hamper many viewers from being charmed, thrilled or even intrigued...", "'Rebecca' doesn't alter perceptions of du Maurier's protagonist beyond making her less neurotic.", "Overall, it's a highly polished and consistently enjoyable watch that feels a little hemmed in by convention.", "The narrative is engaging enough that viewers will at least make it through to the end of the film - but most likely won't return for subsequent viewing.", "It boggles my mind why this remake was made.", "Hitchcock and his cast do it right. And then some. The recent remake, alas, does just about everything wrong."], "rating": ["", "", "7/10", "2.5/5", "3/4", "3/5", "6/10", "3.3/10", "2/5", "", "", "", "", "", "2/5", "2/5", "3/5", "2/5", "C", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Alex Bentley", "Nicole Ackman", "Richard Crouse", "Leo Brady", "Amelia Emberwing", "Alan Ng", "Diana Mangas", "Trace Thurman", "Jason Best", "Tom Fitzgerald and Lorenzo Marquez", "Roxana Hadadi", "Sarah Marrs", "Sameen Amer", "Filipe Freitas", "Graham Fuller", "Robbie Collin", "Callum Crumlish", "Dennis Schwartz", "Eleanor Ringel Cater"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CultureMap", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Next Best Picture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AMovieGuy.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">What to Watch", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Interrogantes", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Horror Queers Podcast", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Marie Claire", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tom &amp; Lorenzo", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Pajiba", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lainey Gossip", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The News International (Pakistan)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Always Good Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Arts Desk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Express (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Saporta Report (Atlanta)"], "date": ["February 10, 2021", "February 5, 2021", "February 1, 2021", "January 29, 2021", "January 29, 2021", "January 27, 2021", "January 4, 2021", "January 3, 2021", "December 30, 2020", "December 21, 2020", "December 21, 2020", "December 7, 2020", "December 3, 2020", "December 2, 2020", "November 27, 2020", "November 26, 2020", "November 20, 2020", "November 20, 2020", "November 20, 2020", "November 13, 2020"]}}
