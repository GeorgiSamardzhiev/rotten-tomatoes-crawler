[Full Review in Spanish]", "Director Howard Hawks, who made Red River in 1948, has come up with another big, handsome and entertaining western.", "It's long but involving, with an unexpectedly good performance from Dean Martin.", "Rio Bravo isn't a Fordian display of vast Western visas; the contours explored here are emotional.", "Underrated at the time of its release, this majestically paced western is one of the finest achievements of the genre and stands as a career-best for many of its participants.", "Warm, witty and endlessly welcoming, not only is it the filmmaker's finest Oater -- better even than the sparkling Red River -- it's arguably the quintessential Hawks flick.", "A definitive piece of Americana by way of Howard Hawks, Rio Bravo is what the late 1950s studio system was all about", "The movie is simultaneously an apogee of the classic Western style, with its principled violence in defense of just law, and an eccentrically hyperbolic work of modernism, which yokes both bumptious erotic comedy and soul-searing rawness to the mission.", "To watch Rio Bravo is to see a master craftsman at work.
