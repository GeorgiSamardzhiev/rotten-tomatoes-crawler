{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Sam Stone (Danny DeVito) hates his wife, Barbara (Bette Midler), so much that he wants her dead. He's ecstatic when she's taken by a duo of kidnappers who want $500,000 ransom in exchange for her life. Fully intending to ignore every one of the kidnappers' demands in the hopes that they do him a favor and murder her for him, the two confused kidnappers (Judge Reinhold, Helen Slater) have to figure out how they're going get their money, and what they're going to do with the overbearing Barbara.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Jim Abrahams, David Zucker, Jerry Zucker", "studio": "TouchstonePictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 5, 2015", "box_office": "$70.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A great deal of bizarre circumstances occur in this very effective farce, and for any mind that is easily won over by the insistence of shocking humor, it continues to hold a bewildering power to inspire shock, awe and some unforgettable chuckles.", "DeVito and Midler are superb in their roles as the greedy philanderer and his screaming, overbearing other half.", "The characters here aren't just bad; most of them are truly vile -- human slime. And the film makers chew them up (especially two nefarious bonbons played by Danny DeVito and Bette Midler) with the toothsome glee of jolly cannibals.", "Occasionally crude and tasteless, Ruthless People is a comedy with a vitriolic twist. It`s a comedy about people who love to hate, with actors who make it worth seeing.", "Much of the fun of this comedy is in watching what happens as virtually everyone in the movie tries to double-cross or otherwise take advantage of everyone else.", "Call it rude, crude, and lewd, but you also have to call it very funny.", "An undemanding but well-executed entertainment.", "The people who made Ruthless People probably expect us to laugh... at the pushy people who populate their story. And they're right: We will laugh -- not because we have lousy taste (and wicked thoughts) ourselves, but because their film is genuinely funny.", "Ruthless People contains some of the biggest laughs of 1986.", "At its considerable best, Ruthless People is a riotous anomaly: a very good farce about very bad taste.", "It's a rare kind of craftsmanship, and it produces a rare kind of pleasure.", "Ruthless People is a hilariously venal comedy about a kidnapped harridan whose rich husband won't pay for her return.", "", "DeVito at his best.", "A pity that the directors prove less ruthless than their own creations, but there is more than enough here for people who enjoy murder attempts on cute pet poodles.", "One of the best comedy capers of the 80's", "", "", "", ""], "rating": ["3.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "3/4", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "3/5", "4/5", "", "3/5", "3/5", "2/5", "3/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Keyes", "Jo Berry", "Michael Wilmington", "Candice Russell", "Jay Boyar", "", "Desmond Ryan", "Joe Baltake", "Gene Siskel", "Ralph Novak", "Dave Kehr", "Variety Staff", "David Kaplan", "Cole Smithey", "Chris Peachment", "Caffeinated Clint", "Jake Euker", "Emanuel Levy", "Fr.
