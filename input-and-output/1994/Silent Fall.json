{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Having seen the murder of his parents, autistic youth Tim Warden (Ben Faulkner) is sent to therapy with Dr. Jake Rainer (Richard Dreyfuss). Jake tries to talk with the silent child about what he saw, but he gets more details about the Wardens' household dynamics from Tim's teenage sister, Sylvie (Liv Tyler). As he spends more time with the siblings, Jake learns that the Wardens' marriage was not as perfect as it seemed, and he uncovers other new details that might help solve the crime.", "rating": "22", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Bruce Beresford", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 12, 2019", "box_office": "$2.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["As a thriller, it's a dead loss, mainly due to a dearth of suspects - this film must have had the lowest extras budget of last year.", "A tense and terrific thriller.
