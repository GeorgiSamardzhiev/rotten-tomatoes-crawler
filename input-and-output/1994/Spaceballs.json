But help arrives for the Princess in the form of renegade space pilot Lone Starr (Bill Pullman) and his half-man, half-dog partner, Barf (John Candy).", "rating": "55", "genre": "Comedy/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Mel Brooks", "studio": "MetroGoldwynMayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 20, 2015", "box_office": "$36.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Space films are Mel Brooks' latest target in this Star Wars parody that might be appropriately titled Schtick Wars.", "[Mel] Brooks continues to be a better producer for others than a director of his own movies.
