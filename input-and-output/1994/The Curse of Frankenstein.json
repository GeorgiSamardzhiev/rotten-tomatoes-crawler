{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Victor Frankenstein (Peter Cushing) is a brilliant scientist willing to stop at nothing in his quest to reanimate a deceased body. After alienating his longtime friend and partner, Paul Krempe (Robert Urquhart), with his extreme methods, Frankenstein assembles a hideous creature (Christopher Lee) out of dead body parts and succeeds in bringing it to life.

[Full Review in Spanish]", "A movie with a distinctive mood and style that finds its own niche.", "This was the classic that single-handedly revived traditional British Gothic and firmly placed the \"Hammer House of Horror\" on the global gore map.", "The immense possibilities of the Frankenstein story have here been sacrificed by an ill-made script, poor direction and performance and, above all, a preoccupation with disgusting - not horrific - charnelry.", "In its best scenes, it adds dynamism and British grit to a genre that had previously tried to get by on atmospherics and mood alone. It manages to be shocking without being especially frightening, and its virtues of performance and style remain striking.", "Christopher Lee is excellent as the mute monster, but this is Cushing's film all the way, and his ground-breaking portrayal of Baron Frankenstein dominated the series in five more films ...", "Revitalized the British film industry.", "A sterling exemplar of the best of everything that made Hammer so special.", "Further developments of Hammer Studios as a spook-house Ealing", "Peter Cushing gets every inch of drama from the leading role, making almost believable the ambitious urge and diabolical accomplishment.", "... established new style for horror -- bold, bloody, beautiful-- that completely broke tradition with the cobwebby classics of the 1930s and 1940s.", "The whole thing in fact looks surprisingly tacky for a film which sparked a box-office bonanza.", "[A] routine horror picture, which makes no particular attempt to do anything more important than scare you with corpses and blood ...", "Beautifully portrayed by Christopher Lee, the Monster is almost heartbreaking, flailing confusedly with a pained expression on its patchwork face.", "", "The movie that started the Hammer horror craze.
