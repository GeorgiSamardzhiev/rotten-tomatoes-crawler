The pace is so incredible, thanks to director William Friedkin [that] it seems like the picture takes only fifteen minutes to run off... and it's two hours long!", "...while The French Connection shows us the realistic problems of life on the street and the drug trade, it also totally entertains us.", "One of the films that laid out a roadmap for how '70s cinema might go, and it is to the medium's benefit that it followed that map.", "Gangbusters adjusted to the new decade's grungy ambiguity", "Classic cop film with frequent profanity, violence.", "Its trigger-fast, explosive scenes and high-tension chase sequences (the one in \"Bullitt\" pales by comparison) will have you literally gasping for breath.", "To watch The French Connection now is to experience the shock of the old: a lost world of the city, and a lost style of film-making.", "There is only one problem with the excitement generated by this film. After it is over, you will walk out of the theater and, as I did, curse the tedium of your own life. I kept looking for someone who I could throw up against a wall.", "...a classic bit of '70s filmmaking.", "Hard as nail crime saga with a blistering central performance.", "Four decades after its initial release, William Friedkin's Oscar-sweeper The French Connection remains an electrifying achievement.", "A true Hollywood classic.", "It's hard to imagine it now, but there are only two types of cop movie: pre and post-The French Connection. That's how big it is.", "Exciting cinema that's not to be missed by those in search of a fast-paced, well-crafted thriller.", "well-acted, well-written and brilliantly directed film that could be recommended even to those viewers with little interest in history of cinema", "Grounded in a gritty reality - and shot as such - it's still an action classic today that offers adrenaline-fueled pacing without insulting one's intelligence.", "With its deathless car chase, Friedkin's film became an instant American classic...
