{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Greedy executive Sidney J. Mussburger (Paul Newman) hopes to take control of the company he works for by purchasing a majority share -- but he must first devalue the stock. So he convinces the board to appoint know-nothing recent graduate Norville Barnes (Tim Robbins). But Mussburger's plot backfires when Barnes' latest invention succeeds, thereby increasing the company's value. Worse yet, undercover reporter Amy Archer (Jennifer Jason Leigh) has the scoop on Mussburger's shady dealings.", "rating": "59", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Joel Coen, Ethan Coen", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,SilverPictures", "theater_date": "Mar 11, 1994", "dvd_date": "Oct 24, 2008", "box_office": "$2.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["I have, minimally, enjoyed every film from the Coen Brothers, yet in my eyes The Hudsucker Proxy is the finest of all of them.", "Dark Coen Brothers screwball comedy has suicide, smoking.", "Once the film gets up to speed, it remains going fast enough to barrel through the awkward blend of tones.", "It is possible to create something emotionally true out of second-hand ingredients, in fact that's what Hollywood does, but it isn't the Coen Brothers' strong point.", "Few of the Coen Brothers' films spike the vein of pure pleasure as easily. It's an irresistibly loquacious, unpredictably riotous comedy that dares you to keep up with its daffiness and doesn't give a damn whether you get left behind.", "", "A pastiche of a movie that lacks distinct identity and authenticity, made up of borrowed parts from scrwball comedies Frank Capra, Howard Hawks, and Preston Sturges.", "A visually arresting but emotionally uninvolving dark comedy.", "A jeering, dreamlike comedy with nothing much on its mind except how neat the Coen brothers are and how stupid or contemptible everybody else is, including everyone in the audience.", "An impressive technical achievement--the period New York sets are to die for -- and its version of the invention of the hula-hoop is a comic highlight.", "Nearly everything in the Coen brothers' latest and biggest film seems like a wizardly but artificial synthesis, leaving a hole in the middle where some emotion and humanity should be.", "", "Bizarre, yet typical Coen comedy. Very dark and cartoonish.", "A minor work, but confirmation of the Coens' position among America's most ambitious, able and exciting film-makers.", "", "Criminally overlooked and sinfully wonderful Coen brothers comedy.
