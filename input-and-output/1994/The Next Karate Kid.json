{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Karate master Mr. Miyagi (Noriyuki \"Pat\" Morita) goes to Boston to attend a military reunion. There, he visits with Louisa (Constance Towers), the widow of his former commander, and meets her granddaughter, Julie (Hilary Swank). Julie's parents were recently killed in a car accident, and she is still reeling from the loss. When Julie surprises Miyagi with her knowledge of karate, he takes her to a Buddhist monastery for training and to help her come to terms with her angst.", "rating": "7", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Christopher Cain", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$8.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An irrelevant foot note in the \"Karate Kid\" series that can be overlooked if only for being so vanilla.", "A few pre-prom dance lessons are the only significant departure from the tried and tested chop-socky formula, although Michael Ironside is good value as Swank's sinister gym teacher.", "Amid its familiar banalities and formula twists, The Next Karate Kid comes up with one new idea for dealing with difficult American teen-agers: ship 'em off to a Buddhist monastery for two weeks!", "This desperate attempt to keep the franchise alive and kicking resorts to a backhanded kind of political correctness: introducing a surly teenage girl karate expert who goes around talking about \"kicking butt.\"", "The Next Karate Kid is harmless as children's entertainment, but for 104 very long minutes, there isn't a recognizable human being in sight.", "The overt message of any Karate Kid movie: Don't fight unless you absolutely have to. The implicit message: You'll always have to. Let the smitings begin!", "While the message that a girl can defend herself against the boys threatening her is a good one, it's lost in a movie where the bullies look like Mussolini's bodyguards and where Julie waits for her boyfriend and Miyagi to come to her defense.", "Swank and Morita make a personable pair, enough so that we don't miss Macchio. The monks exude a benevolent presence in a film less trivial than it could have been.", "Only the reasonably-appealing performances of Morita and newcomer Swank keep it all from becoming even more of a loser.", "Not that girls will go see this or boys will care.", "Violent sequel doesn't benefit from gender change.", "...a weak sequel that boasts few compelling attributes aside from Pat Morita's expectedly stirring turn as Mr. Miyagi.", "The franchise is still kicking -- but not very high.", "Almost a guilty pleasure. But not quite.", "Overlong and utterly predictable, The Next Karate Kid offers little excitement, even in its culminating fight sequence.", "Desperately trying to infuse new blood into the 1980s franchise, the fourth installment is a hodgepodge that fashions recycled ideas and characters; the rebllious girl is played Hilary Swank, who would go to Oscar glory.", "Swank, here demonstrating that for as wooden and exasperating as her performance is in this picture, it's the only performance she's ever contributed to any film.", "Formula still grabs, even with Swank as \"Kid\"", "", "One time to the well too many."], "rating": ["", "2/5", "2/4", "", "1.5/4", "", "1.5/4", "", "1/4", "C-", "2/5", "2/4", "", "2/5", "2.5/4", "D", "0.5/4", "3/5", "2/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Felix Vasquez Jr.", "David Parkinson", "Stephen Hunter", "Ralph Novak", "John Hartl", "Chris Willman", "Carrie Rickey", "Candice Russell", "Clifford Terry", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Charles Cassady", "David Nusair", "Lisa Nesselson", "", "", "Emanuel Levy", "Walter Chaw", "Steve Crum", "Philip Martin", "Michael A.
