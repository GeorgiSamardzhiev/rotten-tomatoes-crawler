{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Josey Wales (Clint Eastwood) watches helplessly as his wife and child are murdered, by Union men led by Capt. Terrill (Bill McKinney). Seeking revenge, Wales joins the Confederate Army. He refuses to surrender when the war ends, but his fellow soldiers go to hand over their weapons -- and are massacred by Terrill. Wales guns down some of Terrill's men and flees to Texas, where he tries to make a new life for himself, but the bounty on his head endangers him and his new surrogate family.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Western", "runtime": "2h 15m", "director": "Clint Eastwood", "studio": "MalpasoCompany", "theater_date": "Jun 30, 1976", "dvd_date": "Jun 1, 2011", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A touch overlong, with coverage of events clearly borrowed from the techniques of Sergio Leone, but nevertheless a thrilling Western epic.", "Eastwood is hamstrung by the script, which purports to be about revenge... but so quickly veers off into other directions it's virtually impossible to keep the original impetus in mind.", "The Outlaw Josey Wales could be said to be the work of an artist without any other goal than the mechanical repetition of formulas and already known situations. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Eastwood's laconic gunslinger leaves a trail of bodies and tobacco spit throughout the film, but the trajectory lies in his questioning of the Man-of-No-Name mold though interaction with the more earthbound humans.", "Clint Eastwood seized the directorial reins from Phil Kaufman and fashioned this tough, sprawling post-Civil War western epic into something approaching a personal testament.", "It's true enough that The Outlaw Josey Wales makes no attempt to hide its true nature, but that isn't to say it doesn't reward a closer look.", "Wales also possesses a touching emotional vulnerability that marks another significant step away from Eastwood's often-overcriticized \"macho\" image.", "An important movie in the maturation of Clint Eastwood as both actor and director.", "Though the story is pat...there's pleasure to be had in the memorable one-liners, the irreverent humor...and the Western action against the backdrop of frontier scenery.
