{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A staunch advocate of healthy living, Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (Anthony Hopkins) opens a sanitarium that promotes his progressive, if eccentric, ideas about optimal well-being. Among the clients who arrive at the facility are the opportunistic Charles Ossining (John Cusack), who is keen on marketing Kellogg's cereal, and the wealthy Will Lightbody (Matthew Broderick) and his wife, Eleanor (Bridget Fonda). This comedy is inspired by an actual spa run by Dr. Kellogg at the turn of the century.", "rating": "41", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy", "runtime": "2h", "director": "Alan Parker", "studio": "DirtyHandsProductions,BeaconCommunications,ColumbiaPictures,BeaconPictures,Per-FoPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 24, 2020", "box_office": "$6.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "", "", "Painful.", "", "", "", "Much maligned Alan Parker comedy that looks better all the time", "Even a stellar cast can't save this meandering farce from a script that needs a high colonic.", "", "", "", "One hilarious organic metaphor after another", "", "Off-putting at first, this self-consciously scatological comedy does grow on one.", "The movie is quite jolly in its preoccupation with digestion and the processes which precede and follow it.", ""], "rating": ["C-", "3/5", "C", "1/5", "1.5/4", "2/5", "6/10", "4/5", "2/5", "3/5", "1/5", "0/5", "", "4/10", "4/5", "3/4", "2/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Joe Williams", "Emanuel Levy", "Victoria Alexander", "Leonard Schwarz", "Philip Martin", "Dragan Antulov", "Ken Hanke", "Jonathan R.
