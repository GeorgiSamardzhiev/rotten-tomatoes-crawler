{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Yorkshire coal miner Frank Machin (Richard Harris) picks a fight in a club and subsequently finds himself being recruited for a rugby team. He's an unpolished player, but his aggressiveness, brutality and indifference to the rules of fair play impress the team owners. Suddenly a rising star, Frank despairs that his success on the playing field isn't equaled in his personal life. He loves a widowed, emotionally challenged landlady (Rachel Roberts) who's too damaged to return his feelings.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h 14m", "director": "Lindsay Anderson", "studio": "TheRankOrganization[gb],JulianWintle/LeslieParkynProductions,IndependentArtistsLtd.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 18, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Although what it narrates is familiar to me with the domestic disputes of the protagonists, I immediately forget any comparison when i'm moved with the powerful performances from Richard Harris and Rachel Roberts.

The black and white cinematography is gorgeously stark, the perfect medium for this bleakly unforgiving tale.", "This Sporting Life shrewdly anticipates modern Britain: a dour, yet thrilling and exhilarating film.", "I'm tempted to see it as one of the strongest films of that period, every frame of which pulsates with drama, class confusion and erotic force.", "", "From its virtuoso opening shot of a rugby scrum -- from the bottom, looking up -- to its final emotionally draining moments, This Sporting Life is a captivating, visceral film experience.", "Lindsay Anderson, making his debut as a feature director, brings the keen, observant eye of a documentary man to many vivid episodes without sacrificing the story line.", "This Sporting Life is a quintessential entrant in Britain's kitchen-sink realism of the late-'50s and '60s.", "A reminder that something really was stirring in those days of the British New Wave before it frittered itself away.", "", "", "", "It's about rugby league, beer, grit and tough lads, but it's also a profound commment on relationships loaded with symbolism and rich in emotion.", "It's impossible not to appreciate the remarkable performances (both Harris and Roberts were nominated for Oscars) or the realistic rugby scenes that earned Harris a broken leg."], "rating": ["7/10", "", "4/5", "9/10", "", "", "3/5", "3/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "4/4", "", "4/4", "", "4/5", "3/5", "5/5", "4/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Yasser Medina", "Dwight MacDonald", "David Parkinson", "Matt Mazur", "MFB Critics", "Donald J.
