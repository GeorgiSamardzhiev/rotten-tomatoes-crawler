{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this imaginative reworking of Anton Chekhov's \"Uncle Vanya,\" filmmaker Louis Malle both distances the playwright's work and makes it more intimate. Theater director Andre Gregory and his actors, including Wallace Shawn as Vanya and Julianne Moore as Yelena, arrive at the decrepit New Amsterdam Theater in New York's Times Square, making casual conversation amongst themselves. While still wearing their street clothes, the actors then perform the play on a nearly blank makeshift stage.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "Louis Malle", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$501.5K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Louis Malle's swan-song, while perhaps not his most noteworthy work, happens to contain a priceless amount of cultural significance, a romantic document of the ultimate theatrical experience.", "The alchemy of Gregory's staging and Malle's direction turn what could have been an exercise in canned theater into something very nearly sublime.", "A deeply moving, inspirational secular-sacred experience both for its beautiful embodiment of Chekhov's story of unmoored souls and for the beauty of the greatest collaborative art form, practiced with pure joy and for love. [Blu-ray]", "... a record of a creative collaboration that has a life of its own, at once documentary, filmed rehearsal, play within a play, and private production restaged for a camera...", "Reuniting with Andrew Gregory, Louis Malle, in what became his swan song, has made a modern, captivation version of the Chekhov play.", "It's amazing it has taken Wallace Shawn, Andre Gregory, and director Louis Malle more than 10 years to collaborate again. It was worth the wait, though.", "The drawback, however, is that the actors chew the scenery in true stagecraft fashion, which, on film, induces regular wincing and a wish that they would hand out the valium and take it easy.", "Not entirely successful, but undeniably brave.", "There are moments of considerable power here but this stripped-down rendering gives us something closer to a latterday dysfunctional family than Chekhov's doomed bourgeoisie.", "The performances are precise, the language is alive and well spoken and the setting is striking, but Vanya on 42nd Street still suffers rather heavily from the limitations of filmed theater.", "Malle adeptly eases us into the play so we can't tell at what precise moment Chekhov takes over, an ambiguity that becomes the film's triumph as well as its key limitation.", "It offers a unique viewing at a work in progress.", "There's more power here than in all the multi-million dollar fireworks of Hollywood.", "", "A movie by, about and for actors.", "", "", "Despite great acting, the general impression of the film is underwhelming.", "", "The elegant understatement of this production turns it into a livelier experiment, a fluent, gripping version of one of Chekhov's more elusive plays."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "4/4", "", "B+", "A", "2/5", "", "3/4", "", "", "A-", "", "4/5", "4/5", "5/5", "4/5", "6/10", "4/4", "4.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "James Kendrick", "Peter Canavese", "Sean Axmaker", "Emanuel Levy", "Owen Gleiberman", "", "", "", "Todd McCarthy", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Dennis Schwartz", "", "Emanuel Levy", "Sarah Chauncey", "Carol Cling", "Daniel M.
