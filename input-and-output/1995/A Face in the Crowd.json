{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Ambitious young radio producer Marcia Jeffries (Patricia Neal) finds a charming rogue named Larry \"Lonesome\" Rhodes (Andy Griffith) in an Arkansas drunk tank and puts him on the air. Soon, Rhodes' local popularity gets him an appearance on television in Memphis, which he parlays into national network stardom that he uses to endorse a presidential candidate for personal gain. But the increasingly petulant star's ego, arrogance and womanizing threaten his rise to the top.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h 5m", "director": "Elia Kazan", "studio": "NewtownProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 2, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The quiet, intimate scenes and background effects of Miss Neal, Matthau, and Franciosa maintain a level of distinction which cancels out much of the bombast and makes [the move], paradoxically enough, the most interesting film from Hollywood this year.", "It's the kind of cautionary tale (with an astounding, if improbably hopeful, finale) that never loses its relevance.", "Instead of implying their criticism of TV values through asserting their own, Kazan and Schulberg make a token gesture of protest, in which they have no faith.", "Consider this [film] an essential one for these equally essential times.", "Budd Schulberg has weakened his own short story by expanding it for the screen, and Elia Kazan's direction becomes far too hectic before the finish...", "A Face in the Crowd (1957) is director Elia Kazan's satirical and powerful socio-political drama that illustrated how a jailed, down-home country boy in the late 1950s could be transformed overnight into a media celebrity on the radio, and later", "Not until Robert Redford's Quiz Show had a movie so clearly illustrated the power of the idiot box -- in this case, its ability to mold the minds of susceptible Americans who will swallow anything that passes before their eyes.", "a masterful, enthralling work of both disturbing prescience and in-the-moment acuity", "Elia Kazan's A Face in the Crowd [is] a darker take on faux-populism that's somehow still not as dark as what's happening on our side of the screen.", "Griffith's hungry, lunging performance is a shock and a revelation to anyone who knows him primarily from The Andy Griffith Show or, God knows, Matlock.", "A fascinating early look at the unholy alliance between politics and entertainment, the corporations controlling it all. With Griffith's wild performance, even though the film has its flaws, it's worth viewing.", "Another fruitful collaboartion between Kazan and Budd Schulberg (On the Waterfront), a poignant film about celebrity, the mass media, and the political process.", "A Face in the Crowd has never ceased to be relevant.", "It's a biting 'rise and fall' satire, sending out a warning to watch out for legends created on the boob tube.", "A raw, penetrating, and terrifying portrait of humanity.", "", "What starts out as a seemingly liberal tract rapidly becomes a smug, cynical exercise in misanthropy.", "", "...an important cautionary tale for all of us not take everything we see and hear at face value.", "Next time you feel like you're getting fooled again by a demagogue, rent this movie and get centered"], "rating": ["", "8/10", "", "9/10", "", "A+", "4/4", "4/4", "", "5/5", "7/10", "B+", "", "B", "4/4", "4/5", "", "4/5", "7/10", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Andrew Sarris", "Mike Massie", "Karel Reisz", "Nathanael Hood", "Clyde Gilmour", "Tim Dirks", "Matt Brunson", "James Kendrick", "Sherilyn Connelly", "Rob Gonsalves", "Kimberly Gadette", "Emanuel Levy", "J.
