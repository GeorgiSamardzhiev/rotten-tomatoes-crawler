{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Shy, obese teen Angus Bethune (Charlie Talbert) lives with his 18-wheeler-driving mom (Kathy Bates) and oddball grandfather (George C. Scott). Having loved popular girl Melissa (Ariana Richards) for nearly as long as he's been getting tormented by her jock boyfriend, Rick (James Van Der Beek), he hatches a plan to win her heart.
