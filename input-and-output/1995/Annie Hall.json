{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Comedian Alvy Singer (Woody Allen) examines the rise and fall of his relationship with struggling nightclub singer Annie Hall (Diane Keaton). Speaking directly to the audience in front of a bare background, Singer reflects briefly on his childhood and his early adult years before settling in to tell the story of how he and Annie met, fell in love, and struggled with the obstacles of modern romance, mixing surreal fantasy sequences with small moments of emotional drama.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Woody Allen", "studio": "Rollins-JoffeProductions", "theater_date": "Jan 1, 1977", "dvd_date": "Sep 3, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Simple in story, complex in construction, and unquestionably innovative in style.", "[Woody Allen's] most recognizable film, the one that he is most associated with.", "\"Annie Hall\" isn't a conventional rom-com but a very accurate and bittersweet depiction of the dynamics of relationships, tinged with Allen's melancholic personality, and made to go down easier than it normally would, due to his world-class humor.", "...a style that was at once realistic, deeply personal, and still full of energy and humor.", "[Woody Allen] has miraculously made his most personal film his funniest.", "Keaton's own mannerisms-like her congenital inability to utter a complete sentence-can be irritating, she is able to provide a character of full dimensions, with a base of feeling and need that allows Annie Hall to be as moving as it is merry.", "Annie Hall is as good as it is because its comedy is always on the brink of the minor tragedies of real life and love.", "The best film Woody Allen has ever made.", "Romantic, honest, and touching - all the kinds of things one wants from a smart rom-com that refuses to be guided by the genre's tropes.", "Woody Allen has outdone himself. If Annie Hall is any indication, he has grown as a filmmaker; his latest movie displays far greater discipline and completeness than any past work.", "Clearly a deeply personal work for Allen, almost autobiographical in its evocation of his worldview.", "Annie Hall may be 40 years old this year, but it still holds up as a great romantic comedy, that is simultaneously hilarious, sweet, and at times unexpectedly sad.", "Annie Hall is a great step forward in the already brilliant career of Woody Allen. [Full Review in Spanish]", "A soft, fuzzy, mildly diverting letdown.", "Woody Allen fans will buy it 100%. Never before has the diminutive comedian been so urbane, so open - so funny. And with lovely Diane Keaton as consort, it becomes well-nigh irresistible (especially if you find Keaton as well-nigh irresistible as I do).", "Allen tosses out the usual romantic comedy conventions for his own brand of humor, but under the gags and self-effacing jokes is the portrait of two people who fall in love and then... fall out of love.", "Allen's imaginative, often avant-garde approach to the material goes a long way towards compensating for a decidedly uneven atmosphere...", "I think It's his best picture so far, and I hope that audiences will enjoy his drily aggressive, despairingly narcissistic humour as much as I did.", "This is Woody Allen's signature film, arguably his best and certainly his most popular.", "Allen (as a result of his exposure to Bergman, perhaps) has greatly matured as a filmmaking talent. Annie Hall is, by far, his most sophisticated, most emotionally complex film."], "rating": ["1", "", "4.5/5", "", "", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "4/4", "", "", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "A+", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Allen Almachar", "Mark Jackson", "Kathi Maio", "Geoff Brown", "Urjo Kareda", "David Robinson", "Ruth Batchelor", "James Berardinelli", "E.
