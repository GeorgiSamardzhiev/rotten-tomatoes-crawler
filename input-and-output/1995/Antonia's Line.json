{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After World War II, Antonia (Willeke van Ammelrooy) and her daughter, Danielle (Els Dottermans), go back to their Dutch hometown, where Antonia's late mother has bestowed a small farm upon her. There, Antonia settles down and joins a tightly-knit but unusual community. Those around her include quirky friend Crooked Finger (Mil Seghers), would-be suitor Bas (Jan Decleir) and, eventually for Antonia, a granddaughter and great-granddaughter who help create a strong family of empowered women.", "rating": "67", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Marleen Gorris", "studio": "EuropeanCo-productionFund,PrimeTime,Eurimages,BardEntertainmentsLtd.[gb]", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$45.1K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The most energizing, uplifting, woman-positive film I've ever seen.", "[Antonia's Line] ultimately evolves into a familial epic covering three generations of independent women. It is fine storytelling.", "It's a broad historical saga of great warmth, but it would have been more convincing if it didn't have \"feminist agenda\" stamped all over it.", "Antonia is a work of rare lyricism. It glows with the light of a Flemish painting and the spirit of magic realism.", "Antonia's Line is enjoyable because it is never preachy. It depicts, with a painterly eye, a pagan world that has not changed since Breughel.", "There are a few moments of grating sentimentality, but these are balanced with a quirky humour and a mildly daring unpredictability.", "The movie is so pastorally lovely to look at, its characters so likable and its lulling rhythms so soothing that it's easy to forget that it's a lot of pleasant, plotless hooey.", "A hamfisted feminist parable.", "The performances are modest and appealing. In the title role, Van Ammelrooy projects a remarkable combination of optimism, strength and resignation.", "Antonia's Line perfectly fits the Oscar mold: set in the past, studiously PC, sentimental, multigenerational, and loaded with hollow ruminations on the nature of life, death, and the passage of time.", "The movie has the feel and flow of magic realism, and brilliant performances by Willeke van Ammelooy as the Earth Mother Antonia and Els Dottermans as her lesbian daughter are extremely vivid.", "It glides so easily over a multitude of events and characters that we're never jarred; Antonia and Bas make a winning alternative-community grandma and grandpa.", "I didn't much take to this humorless, Oscar-winning 1995 feminist fable.", "Morbid and overwrought.", "Poignant and pertinent, perhaps, but ultimately somewhat self-satisfied.", "Beautiful, tender, hearty and poetic.", "Antonia's Line is a Dutch treat that unfolds like a generous novel, surrounding you with its indelible sense of time, place and character.", "In the title role, Van Ammelrooy provides a strong center to the rambling story, both feminine and authoritative.", "Antonia's Line is a masterpiece. I say that even though I found the first 10 minutes ho-hum. By the time the movie was half over, I was hoping it would never end.", "Harsh and gentle, sensual and intellectual, wise-ass and heartfelt -- it's a full package."], "rating": ["", "3/4", "", "3.5/4", "2.5/4", "", "", "2/5", "4/5", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "3/5", "", "3/4", "", "", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Kathi Maio", "Mal Vincent", "Chris Peachment", "Carrie Rickey", "Howard Kissel", "Film4 Staff", "Rod Dreher", "", "Jay Boyar", "Todd Anthony", "Stephen Hunter", "Michael Wilmington", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Ralph Novak", "David Parkinson", "Kevin Thomas", "Jeff Shannon", "Variety Staff", "Bob Fenster", "Rob Gonsalves"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">On the Issues", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Virginian-Pilot", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arizona Republic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com"], "date": ["February 26, 2020", "January 9, 2019", "November 28, 2017", "October 4, 2016", "October 4, 2016", "October 4, 2016", "October 4, 2016", "October 4, 2016", "October 4, 2016", "October 4, 2016", "October 4, 2016", "October 4, 2016", "October 4, 2016", "October 4, 2016", "October 4, 2016", "October 4, 2016", "October 4, 2016", "February 6, 2009", "May 8, 2007", "April 9, 2007"]}}
