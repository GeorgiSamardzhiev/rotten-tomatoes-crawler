{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Batman (Val Kilmer) faces off against two foes: the schizophrenic, horribly scarred former District Attorney Harvey Dent, aka Two-Face (Tommy Lee Jones), and the Riddler (Jim Carrey), a disgruntled ex-Wayne Enterprises inventor seeking revenge against his former employer by unleashing his brain-sucking weapon on Gotham City's residents. As the caped crusader also deals with tortured memories of his parents' murder, he has a new romance, with psychologist Chase Meridian (Nicole Kidman).", "rating": "39", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 1m", "director": "Joel Schumacher", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,PolyGramFilmedEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 31, 2013", "box_office": "$182.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Everything that Burton established with the first two Batman films has been tossed out the window to make room for colorful neon lights and grossly comical character designs.", "Nobody here is arguing that Batman Forever is the best version of the character, but it's always delivered with a knowing nod and a careful hand.", "Even if it all devolves into a nonsensical confection by its final act, it is, as Roger Ebert brilliantly tagged it, \"great bubblegum for the eyes\". Worth a nostalgic re-tread", "I defy you to find any DC movie that has as much fun existing as BATMAN FOREVER does. I wish we had seen Kilmer return to don the mantle of the Bat at least one more time, but I will enjoy the one we got.", "There isn't any fun to be found in watching Batman Forever.", "The whole thing is just that little bit wackier, perhaps closer to the 60s TV version - although Two-Face's burns are nastier than that show would have permitted.", "We get lots of shouting, lame action and Nicole Kidman spouting 90s era pop psychology.", "Directed by Joel Schumacher with occasional gestures toward social commentary, and enough spectacle to mask the movie's deep-down emptiness.", "Batman Forever is a visual tour de force, a knock-your-eyes-out effort. But it overdoes, overkills. And what starts out exhilarating ends up...exhausting.", "It's nice that The Third Man should provide a model for The Third Batman, but a pity Batman doesn't have Graham Greene's narrative drive.", "It doesn't add up to much, but it's certainly entertaining.", "As for Two-Face, my favorite Batman baddie on the printed page, Tommy Lee Jones makes a complete mockery of the character with a broad performance that's difficult to stomach.", "The gulf between the dark universe Burton's film set up and the tremendously silly camp world that [Batman Forever was] hunting for was too great to hybridise the two.", "Batman is transformed in to Flesh Gordon with a phallic bat mobile, Bat nipples and sexual chemistry with his young ward...", "A flashy movie that's more like a video game.", "Under Joel Schumacher's helm, this third chapter is disappointing--despite a new Batman (the vain Val Kilmer), new femme, new villains and characters, new costumes and even new Batmobile.", "Die-hard Batman fans will be even more disappointed with this than they were with Burton's version.", "Schumacher's spin on the black-suited vigilante is as flawed as it is brilliant, as messy as it is impressive. A bit of a two-face really.", "By now, Jim Carrey is doing sarcastic takes on his own sarcasm, and there's something funny and a little scary in that.", "This is a film not designed to be the best piece of pop art it can possibly be, but calculated to draw the widest possible demographics in order to please WB's merchandising partners."], "rating": ["3/10", "", "2/5", "", "2.5/5", "4/5", "C-", "2/4", "", "", "2.5/4", "2/4", "4/10", "", "3/5", "C", "", "3/5", "B", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Kyle Anderson", "PJ Nabarro", "Alex Maidy", "Danielle Solzman", "Peter Bradshaw", "Rachel Wagner", "David Sterritt", "Carol Buckland", "Quentin Curtis", "Gene Siskel", "Matt Brunson", "Tim Brayton", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Ed Grant", "Emanuel Levy", "", "Ian Nathan", "Owen Gleiberman", "Steve Biodrowski"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Nerdist", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">JoBlo&#39;s Movie Network", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Solzy at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNN.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent on Sunday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinefantastique"], "date": ["September 9, 2020", "September 2, 2020", "March 8, 2020", "October 17, 2019", "June 7, 2019", "May 17, 2019", "April 15, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "January 5, 2018", "December 7, 2017", "August 16, 2017", "October 4, 2012", "July 19, 2012", "July 3, 2012", "January 1, 2011", "August 10, 2010", "July 16, 2010", "July 16, 2010", "July 6, 2010", "March 10, 2009"]}}
