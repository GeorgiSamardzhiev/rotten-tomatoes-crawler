{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Debauched King Henry II (Peter O'Toole) installs his longtime court facilitator Thomas Becket (Richard Burton) as the Archbishop of Canterbury, assuming that his old friend will be a compliant and loyal lackey in the King's ongoing battles with the church. But Becket unexpectedly finds his true calling on the ecclesiastical side, and aligns himself against the king's selfish wishes, causing a rift and an eventual showdown not only between the two men, but also the institutions they represent.", "rating": "76", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h 28m", "director": "Peter Glenville", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 27, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Worth a look... for a single performance:... Peter O'Toole as Becket's king, Henry II.", "Just as the characters' loyalties to one another are called into question, so, too are ours: Becket enters a moral grey area from which it never fully emerges.", "Becket is a terrific example of the historical play or novel turned into a cinematic drama crackling with whip-smart dialogue. I imagine actors must go mad with delight when they read a script that has page after page of dialogue this good.", "it finds what's compelling about that history and, more importantly, what's compelling about the people in that history. And, just to be on the safe side, it throws in two of the greatest actors of the day.", "The respectable but boring film is nevertheless worth watching for the robust performances of Richard Burton and Peter O'Toole", "The material remains relevant, and the film as a whole is completely engrossing. (It may be nearly 2 1/2 hours long, but it doesn't feel like it.)", "Watching Becket is to see a form of stylized, epic moviemaking not practiced today.", "This adaptation of Anouilh's play about the relationship of Henry II and Becket is well acted by O'Toole and Burton, both Oscar-nominated.", "O'Toole just keeps turning up the volume, and it's thrilling to watch.", "Ripe with homoerotic undercurrents -- which O'Toole mines with relish in his great hysterical performance, full of cunning, eloquence and mad outbursts.", "Becket may seem like a movie of yesteryear, but its timeliness brims over with rousing, meditative discourses between Henry and the church leaders on the separation of church and state.", "Everything that Doctor Strangelove is -- daring and inspired, vibrant and brilliantly staged -- Becket is not.", "Peter O'Toole plays Henry like Ian McKellan doing a camp cameo.", "Peter Glenville's stage-plank direction creaks badly, but the acting still holds you.", "The picture is being re-released in 30 cities around the country before finally appearing on DVD after years of online foment from fans.The DVD is due in May, but try to catch it in theaters first. It's worth it.", "Burton is extraordinary in one of his rare good movie roles and O'Toole is regally madcap and larger than life.", "A power play about power plays, Jean Anouilh's now-classic Becket provided the basis for one of the great screen pairings.", "The pleasure of these two extravagantly gifted actors at the top of their game -- their diction! their conviction! their beauty! -- is enormous.", "While peripheral elements of Becket do show their age, the core of the film's appeal remains incandescent, and that is the on-screen collaboration between Burton and O'Toole.", "Most of the dialogue-driven scenes are a series of two-shots; which is great in seeing the sparks fly between two of the leading British actors of their generation, but plodding when it comes to pace."], "rating": ["", "", "4.5/5", "5/5", "C+", "4/4", "4/4", "B+", "B+", "3/4", "", "2.5/4", "C+", "2/4", "B+", "B+", "3.5/4", "3/4", "4/5", "2.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Merl Edelman", "Michael Nordine", "Christopher Lloyd", "David Thomas", "Dennis Schwartz", "Jeff Vice", "Sean P.
