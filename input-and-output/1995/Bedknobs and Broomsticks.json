{"metadata": {"synopsis": "During the Battle of Britain, Miss Eglantine Price (Angela Lansbury), a cunning witch-in-training, decides to use her supernatural powers to defeat the Nazi menace. She sets out to accomplish this task with the aid of three inventive children who have been evacuated from the London Blitz. Joined by Emelius Brown (David Tomlinson), the head of Miss Price's witchcraft training correspondence school, the crew uses an enchanted bed to travel into a fantasy land and foil encroaching German troops.", "rating": "66", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Kids & Family/Musical & Performing Arts/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 57m", "director": "Robert Stevenson", "studio": "WaltDisneyProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 6, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Charming underrated Disney live action musical", "David Tomlinson does his English Fred MacMurray act rather well, Miss Lansbury is as watchable as always and the children aren't too awful. It'll take a mint of money, but not mine.", "[Bedknobs and Broomsticks] would be standard Disney if it were not for a beguiling performance by Angela Lansbury.", "In its indulgence of extremes, Bedknobs and Broomsticks becomes unwieldy, but also capable of reaching unforgettable heights.", "[Blu-ray Review] Some movies from childhood hold up when they are seen as an adult, and others do not, trapped only in the nostalgia of the time in which they were first watched. Recommended for fans, but temper expectations.", "Disney's multi-Oscar nominated musical is not as good as Mary Poppins to which it's often compared, but Angela Lansbury is well-cast and most of the visual effects, which won the Oscar, are impressive.", "A fun, fairly intelligent, unexpectedly witty example of cinema for children at a time when that genre was at one of its lowest-ever ebbs", "Delightful Disney charmer may be too long for youngest.", "It's a little uneven but at its best Bedknobs And Broomsticks rivals the joy and wonder of Mary Poppins.", "Like Lansbury, the film has aged well and retains almost all of its magic.", "It's more sophisticated than the usual run of Disney product, but it lacks the inventiveness that could endow it with genuine charm.", "The fantasy is earthbound, the score by Richard and Robert Sherman (who also wrote music and lyrics for Mary Poppins) is forgettable, the special effects lackadaisical.", "Animation is neatly mixed with live action, and Lansbury, engaging as ever, heads a capable cast.", "Has many moments rooted in movie magic, but there's also a whole lot of filler that brings the movie to a length that's more than bearable.", "Angela Lansbury shows off her singing, dancing and comic skills -- which I think even overshadow the film's Oscar-winning special effects.", "It's Disney, and it has magic in it, but for me it's a stretch to call the film 'magical.'", "It is when the film [based on the book by Mary Norton] dives deeply into the realms of fantasy that it is most enjoyable.", "Must all films for kids be so shoddy, though? The music is appalling.", "If Jessica Fletcher was a witch all along, you think she could've kept Cabot Cove a little safer", "I suspect the movie will be something of a long, uninterrupted sit for the very children for whom it's intended, and an even longer one for those parents and guardians (both adults and teen-age) who will probably accompany them."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "2/4", "B-", "7/10", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "6/10", "", "", "3/5", "2.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Rachel Wagner", "Derek Malcolm", "Dilys Powell", "Karen Han", "Dustin Putman", "Emanuel Levy", "Tim Brayton", "Nell Minow", "Richard Luck", "Ian Nathan", "Dave Kehr", "Jay Cocks", "", "Ryan Cracknell", "Betty Jo Tucker", "James Plath", "Variety Staff", "", "Pete Vonder Haar", "Vincent Canby"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rachel&#39;s Reviews (YouTube)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sunday Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Polygon", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheBluFile.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Views", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ReelTalk Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Metropolis", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times"], "date": ["September 15, 2020", "February 11, 2020", "February 11, 2020", "December 22, 2018", "August 14, 2014", "April 3, 2012", "December 15, 2010", "October 1, 2010", "November 3, 2009", "November 3, 2009", "November 3, 2009", "November 3, 2009", "November 3, 2009", "September 27, 2009", "September 7, 2009", "September 5, 2009", "March 26, 2009", "January 26, 2006", "October 28, 2005", "May 9, 2005"]}}
