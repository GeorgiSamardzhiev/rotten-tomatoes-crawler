{"metadata": {"synopsis": "On his way to Vienna, American Jesse (Ethan Hawke) meets Celine (Julie Delpy), a student returning to Paris. After long conversations forge a surprising connection between them, Jesse convinces Celine to get off the train with him in Vienna. Since his flight to the U.S. departs the next morning and he has no money for lodging, they wander the city together, taking in the experiences of Vienna and each other. As the night progresses, their bond makes separating in the morning a difficult choice.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Richard Linklater", "studio": "CastleRockEntertainment,ColumbiaPicturesCorporation,DetourFilmproduction", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 3, 2008", "box_office": "$4.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Capturing an effervescent mixture of the mid-90s, it's a striking, authentic observation of two people experiencing a romantically charged connection which would come to erode and inform the shape of their future.", "There are so many perfect moments in this film; it is hard to list them without excluding others.", "What a film like Before Sunrise champions is that some of the most meaningful moments in our lives can be sensual and ephemeral: a look, a touch, a feeling, a few short hours.", "The films have always been about the marvels and limitations of impersonation, since behind Jesse and C\u00e9line we see Hawke and Delpy, celebrities whose stars were bright already in the first film and have intensified, owing partly to this series...", "There's a vulnerable undercurrent beneath this film, one that beats and throbs with the stolen looks, brief touches and romantic under-the-stars kisses.", "Undoubtedly one of the most romantic movies of all time...", "...a bittersweet celebration of romantic frisson - the notion that our most precious moments of connection are often the fleeting ones.", "Two strangers quickly fall in love, discuss big ideas.", "Linklater captures romance at the sunset of gadget-free existence ... holy moments when no gadget or lens comes between us and our immediate company and surroundings.", "The combination of optimism, tragedy, and the fuzzy warmth of new love is absolutely flawless.", "", "the film asks us to consider the very nature and purpose of our existence in a fragmentary, superficial and transient universe.", "Linklater hasn't just crafted a detached portrait of a unique couple: he's painting a masterful examination of human nature, of that relationship we all want, but too often sadly see slip away.", "A thought-provoking, likable, entertaining, beautiful, and well-acted piece of romance...", "Acting tour de force that feels exceptionally real", "", "Hawke and Delpy keep the tone not only afloat but mesmerizing. So natural are their performances that it seems impossible not to believe they truly are soulmates who are locked in a doomed, all-too-short affair.", "Inspired by Godard's lyrical film-essays, Linklater revisits his unreleased debut (also set on a train), while paying tribute to Rohmer's cerebral moral fables.
