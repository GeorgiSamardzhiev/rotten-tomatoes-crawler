It may be Antonioni's last.", "While famous for crafting films about incommunicability and alienation, Antonioni here delivers one that simply communicates nothing at all.", "A wasted opportunity.", "It is in the enigma of what it is the lovers want or why they are compelled to want certain things that makes this a fascinating film.", "A slightly erotic and decidedly offbeat movie, Beyond the Clouds has a strong attraction that is hard to put into words. A frustrating film, it is simultaneously bizarrely fascinating and soporifically unsatisfying.", "The moments that work in this movie (and there are many) remind us that most other films of today still have a long way to go.", "None of these stories, except the first, incises deeply, but all of them are immersed in a sense of place, riche but not nouveau riche, no ostentation.
