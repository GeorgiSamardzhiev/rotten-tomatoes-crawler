{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this fact-based film, painter Dora Carrington (Emma Thompson) develops an intimate but extremely complex bond with writer Lytton Strachey (Jonathan Pryce). Though Lytton is a homosexual, he is enchanted by the mysterious Dora and they begin a lifelong friendship that has strangely romantic undertones. Eventually, Lytton and Dora decide to live together, despite the fact that the latter has fallen in love with military man Ralph Partridge (Steven Waddington), whom she plans to marry.", "rating": "54", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 2m", "director": "Christopher Hampton", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 3, 2016", "box_office": "$2.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Even those unfamiliar with Strachey's biographies may be fascinated by Jonathan Pryce's impersonation of him in Carrington.", "A lot has gone wrong. The film suffers from too much detail and too little change of pace.", "This is Hampton's impressive debut as a director; he tells his story with a tactful English reserve that allows deep feelings to find their own way to the surface. He's given a great assist from Michael Nyman's score.", "We feel a tingle of anticipation that this picture is going to be handled intelligently.
