Its Olympus is full of stellar names that demonstrate how ancient gods were immortal.

Yet excellent production, a fine cast and Harryhausen's creatures make it an entertaining, if unsubstantial, episode in epic filmmaking.", "The visual effects are clearly the only thing here that's worth bothering with.", "...a camp-infused fantasy flick that will probably work best among younger viewers and those with fond memories of its original theatrical release.", "Teenage boys will love it, but the rest of us will be frustrated by the storytelling, the shaky camerawork and the dubiously effective 3D presentation, which distracts more than it offers", "...the last hurrah for the master of stop-motion animation, Ray Harryhausen, and it's unfortunate he went out on a less-than-perfect note.", "A poignant eulogy to Harryhausen's handcrafted illusionism in a decade of increasingly synthetic effects", "let your mind go, forgive the wear and tear of time and enjoy the adventure", "Mostly the problem is Beverley Cross' screenplay, which is unacceptably, irredeemably bad.", "Clash of the Titans is an unbearable bore that will probably put to sleep the few adults stuck taking the kids to it.", "Os efeitos criados pelo lendrio Harryhausen podem parecer frgeis diante dos avanos atuais, mas so perfeitos para esta obra que permanece descompromissadamente divertida.", "", "For Harryhausen worshippers only.", "Though star-packed the film is sleep inducing.", ""], "rating": ["7/10", "3/5", "", "6/10", "", "9/10", "", "5/10", "2/4", "", "5/10", "", "3/5", "2/4", "", "3/5", "3/5", "2/5", "C+", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Adrian Turner", "Dave Kehr", "Jared Mobarak", "Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos", "Nick Blackshaw", "Marylynn Uricchio", "Tim Brayton", "David Nusair", "Louise Keller", "John J.
