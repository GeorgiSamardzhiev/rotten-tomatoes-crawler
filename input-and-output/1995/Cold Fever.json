It also looks great and has a driving, eclectic music track.", "Strange, often funny, and occasionally beautiful.", "Like Iceland itself, Cold Fever may seem a trip most audiences initially will reject -- as too distant, too strange, too icebound. They're wrong. Once seen, this cold, feverish wonderland is never forgotten.", "The film has an engagingly hip sensibility that never descends into snobbery and an underlying seriousness that lends a touch of poetry to the self-consciously bizarre proceedings.", "An out-there, sometimes wacky, often mystical road movie about a lone Japanese journeyingacross Iceland to perform a family ritual.", "A one-off that lodges in the memory.", "", "[Cold Fever is] an undiluted pleasure, a road movie combining often surreal comedy and a wealth of gorgeous visuals, capturing Iceland at its most hauntingly ethereal.", "Far from being a random sequence of oddball occurrences, Cold Fever, under its jokey surface, has a steady allegorical resonance.", "Masatoshi Nagase is mesmerizing in the central role, a model of restraint even when confronted with the quirks of the characters he meets on his journey.", "Cold Fever feels like a Jim Jarmusch road movie transplanted to the frozen north.", "", "I suppose its quirkiness is a little formulaic (an American outlaw and his girlfriend run from the Iceland police) and its production value is pretty low, but the scenery is great, [and] the story isn't something you'll see every day.", "An fascinating film that is both a valentine to the charms of Iceland and a flinty meditation on a young man's quest to bestow a blessing on the parents he took for granted.", "A likable if somewhat unoriginal road picture.", "Cold Fever serves a useful function right there: It shows an Icelandic winter close up, and it's a lot more fascinating than you might expect.", "Cold Fever is thoroughly quirky and unusual, and one-hundred-percent experiential. You've got to sweat it out in order to get to the other side.", "An odd and beautiful film about a pilgrimage to a desolate land.", ""], "rating": ["B", "", "", "3.5/4", "3/4", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "2.5/4", "3/4", "", "", "3/4", "3/5", "3/4", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Dennis Schwartz", "Kevin Thomas", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Michael Wilmington", "Dave Kehr", "Derek Elley", "Trevor Johnston", "Emanuel Levy", "Kim Newman", "Stephen Holden", "Film4 Staff", "", "Susan Tavernetti", "Marty Mapes", "Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat", "Mark R.
