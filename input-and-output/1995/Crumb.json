{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Filmmaker Terry Zwigoff creates a complex but affectionate portrait of his longtime friend, underground cartoonist Robert Crumb. A notorious curmudgeon who would prefer to be alone with his fellow cartoonist wife Aline Kominsky-Crumb and his beloved vintage jazz records, Crumb reveals himself to be a complicated personality who suffered a troubled upbringing and harbors a philosophical opposition to the 1960s hippie underground that first celebrated his work.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Comedy/Cult Movies/Documentary/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "Terry Zwigoff", "studio": "SuperiorPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$19.9K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The movie isn't a testimonial or a valentine.

Crumb.", "Among the all-time great American documentaries.", "interesting", "This brilliant docu is not just a portrait of a compulsive artist, but also a deep inquiry into the mysteries of art, creativity, mental illness and family bind.", "Sporadically intriguing but ultimately overrated...", "Zwigoff's biography of Crumb is both absorbing and repellent, and it may be one of the best documentaries to make the connection between creativity and craziness.", "Geek coolness abounds.", "", "", "Unique, profound, and fairly disturbing.", "", "", "", ""], "rating": ["", "", "A", "9/10", "", "4/4", "8/10", "", "3/4", "5/5", "2.5/4", "3/4", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "5/5", "2/5", "4/5", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Michael Sragow", "Quentin Curtis", "Owen Gleiberman", "R.L.
