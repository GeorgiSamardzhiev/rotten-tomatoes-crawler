{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Soldier Anthony Curtis (Larenz Tate) returns to his Bronx home after a nightmarish tour of duty in Vietnam. But the nightmare continues for Anthony and his friends as they suffer the indignities of trying to find steady work and provide for their families in a flagging economy. As desperation takes hold, Anthony teams up with Skip (Chris Tucker), a drug addict, and Kirby (Keith David), a small-time crook, to pull off a bank heist that will give them all a chance for a better

Presidents and his previous film, The Inkwell, the only thing standing between 20-year-old Tate and mainstream stardom is a decent script.", "Dead Presidents may eventually box itself into a narrative dead end, but its muscular engagement of weighty themes and explosive situations makes it a powerful drama.", "The intense and excessive climactic set piece caper scene is the only true highlight in a superficial film.", "Platoon lite with a bitter ending that doesn't work in its favor...", "Significant as both history and film art, this gloomy tale has no \"convenient\" villains and refuses to indulge in stereotypes, instead focusing on larger forces, such as racism and political apathy.", "There are intriguing aspects to this yarn, and the brothers can choreograph a scene, but you get the impression that they learned all they know from other movies, the blood and guts is gratuitous...", "Excellent performances, a great soundtrack, and the Hughes' technical virtuosity make it worth a look.", "Talent of Hughes brothers deserves viewer's attention even when their results don't meet such high standards.", "Like those overreaching sophomore term papers we can all laugh at now, this disappointing film may free the Hughes brothers to move on to fresher, more inspired work.", "", "", "", "", "It's an overly ambitious effort that strains to work as a coming-of-age drama, a 1960s period piece and a searing comment on the way African American GIs went largely unappreciated for their war efforts.", "Unfortunately, the filmmakers were overzealous in trying to cover a variety of issues, leaving the story choppy and without resolution in places.", "All directors experience a \"second-movie slump,\" and as far as slumps go, this one is more than honorable.", "What emerges is an uneasy blend of didacticism and juiced-up bloodletting (the brothers don't know when to stop with the exploding squibs) that bury the film's message and its good intentions.", "Made with fluid skill and a passion for storytelling, its tale of how the Vietnam War and American society affect a black Marine remains accessible while confounding expectations.", "Dead Presidents is like a shotgun blast in the face: It's that powerful, that lethal, that ugly."], "rating": ["4/5", "2.5/5", "", "C+", "2/5", "B", "", "3/4", "7/10", "2/4", "3/4", "2/5", "2/5", "4/5", "2/4", "2/5", "", "", "4/5", ""],
