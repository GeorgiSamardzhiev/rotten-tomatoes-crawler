{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Wrongfully convicted of a robbery and murder, Paul Lavond (Lionel Barrymore) breaks out of prison with a genius scientist who has devised a way to shrink humans. When the scientist dies during the escape, Lavond heads for his lab, using the shrinking technology to get even with those who framed him, and vindicate himself in both the public eye and the eyes of his daughter, Lorraine (Maureen O'Sullivan). When an accident leaves a crazed assistant dead, however, Lavond must again make an escape.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Horror/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 19m", "director": "Tod Browning", "studio": "MetroGoldwynMayer", "theater_date": "Jul 10, 1936", "dvd_date": "Apr 22, 2014", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...all this is wasted in a drearily complicated yarn.", "It's pseudo-scientific, fantastic, terrifying at times and suspenseful in the last half.", "The weakness of The Devil Doll is that it never really fools the audience, in spite of its fine trick photography.", "The scares may be dated, but the miniaturised special effects, relying on oversized props, are still enthralling, and the offbeat fantasy atmosphere Browning expertly conjures up is highly unusual.", "This enjoyable film allows Lionel Barrymore the chance to go the Tootsie route.", "The director, cameraman and art department make the most of it, but the writers' contribution is lacking in originality and seldom is equal to the idea in back of it.", "...more of a mystery yarn, a tall-tale if you will, than a horror movie, although it is big on mood and atmosphere.", "Not since The Lost World, King Kong and The Invisible Man have the camera wizards enjoyed such a field day.", "Browning had made Freaks at MGM, much to Mayer's disgust, and in working out his contract he had to lighten his uniquely dark vision, though the scene of a doll climbing out of a Christmas tree is effectively chilling.", "", "An enthralling weirdo horror thriller directed by Tod Browning.", "Though it might not be the climax to Browning's distinctive career in the genre one might have wished, it's certainly a worthwhile film.", "", "Although the film slows down into the second half, Browning, his leading man Barrymore and the MGM effects department surpass themselves with this bizarre, thoroughly entertaining tale of revenge and shrunken people.", "Seriously creepy.", "One of Browning's more bizarre and enjoyable entries.", "Browning's flat style keeps the action disappointingly in check.", "While The Devil-Doll is no Freaks, director Tod Browning, in his second-to-last film, adds a sinister edge to what is basically a morality play."], "rating": ["", "", "", "3/5", "3/4", "", "7/10", "", "", "3/5", "B", "4.5/5", "4/5", "", "", "5/5", "", "4/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Meyer Levin (Patterson Murphy)", "James T.
