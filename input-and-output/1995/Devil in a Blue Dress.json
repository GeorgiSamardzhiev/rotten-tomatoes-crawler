{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In late 1940s Los Angeles, Easy Rawlins (Denzel Washington) is an unemployed black World War II veteran with few job prospects. At a bar, Easy meets DeWitt Albright (Tom Sizemore), a mysterious white man looking for someone to investigate the disappearance of a missing white woman named Daphne Monet (Jennifer Beals), who he suspects is hiding out in one of the city's black jazz clubs. Strapped for money and facing house payments, Easy takes the job, but soon finds himself in over his head.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Carl Franklin", "studio": "ClinicaEstetico,TriStarPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$15.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A stylish neo-noir which delves into the socio-economic and political landscape of the era.", "A particularly successful homage to noir, Devil in a Blue Dress is a beautiful exploration of tone and motif even as its narrative movements languish in familiarity.", "The film makes excellent use of Washington's star persona; his natural authority, graceful intelligence, and movie-star good looks.", "Competent, and at times compelling, Carl Franklin's pedestrian neo-noir Devil in a Blue Dress boasts a syzygy of talent that keeps it going.", "Carl Franklin (One False Move) is a good-and-getting-better director.", "It's a great mystery, filled suspense and doesn't fail to highlight the relationship between cops and Black folks, especially men, during this era.", "A baker's dozen of books featuring the character of Ezekiel \"Easy\" Rawlins were penned by author Walter Mosley, and it's a shame the box office failure of Devil in a Blue Dress prevented any more mysteries from making the leap from page to screen.", "", "Stylish neo-noir.", "The evocation of that vanished world is alone worth the price of admission. But this classically built genre movie has plenty else to offer, not least of which is Franklin's solid, measured craftsmanship.", "Invoking social realism more than pulp fiction, Carl Franklin's Devil in a Blue Dress is an innovative genre film on several counts.", "Entering the main flow of the story relatively late, Don Cheadle steals all his scenes as a live-wire, trigger-happy old buddy of Easy's from Texas, while Sizemore and Mel Winkler, as colorful underworld figures, make strong impressions.", "In the aftermath of the Oscars, it now seems clear that Devil in a Blue Dress was one of the best films of 1995.", "", "Carl Franklin's unusually creative studio movie, boasting superlative acting from Denzel Washington and particularly newcomer Don Cheadle, reinvents a genre and a bygone era, in this case, Los Angeles circa 1948.", "Sheer pleasure.", "Great, grand piece of modern noir, with a unique twist that rethinks the genre even as it honors its finest elements.
