Doctor Zhivago is more than a masterful motion picture; it is a life experience.", "One of those rare film adaptations which, unless you have already read the book, makes you wonder why anyone ever bothered to make the film at all.", "Maurice Jarre's music is as beguiling as ever and Lean squeezes all the pathos that he can out of the romance between Sharif's Yuri Zhivago and Julie Christie's febrile and gorgeous Lara Antipova.", "The best one can say of Doctor Zhivago is that it is an honest failure.", "Epic seems too small a word for the sweeping ambition and romance of Doctor Zhivago.", "This adaptation of Boris Pasternak's classic novel has all the sweep and stateliness that characterised David Lean's mastery of the epic.", "Lean and Bolt pay tribute to a Tolstoyan ambition in Pasternak's samizdat novel, and also to a real contemporary relevance: the story of a suppressed writer.", "Demands everything from the viewer while offering little in return, with Lean coming across like a despised schoolmaster not wanting to open himself up to his braying students.", "Yes it's old-fashioned and sappy.
