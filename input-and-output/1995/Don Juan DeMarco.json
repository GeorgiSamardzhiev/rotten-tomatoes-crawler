But, mostly, it dances on a very fine knife's edge between charm and absurdity, an irresistible paean to the art of kiss-kiss.", "Clearly, director-writer Jeremy Leven was too intimidated by the great Brando to insist that he enunciate. Too bad. But then, Leven didn't do his job well either.", "The movie itself is never as good as it should be, owing to Leven's lifeless staging.", "For the film to work, we'd have to be in denial... and it's just not magical enough for that.", "Cushy it might be in appearance, but it is also pretty flat.", "Brando doesn't so much walk through this movie as coast, in a gassy, self-indulgent performance no one else could have gotten away with.", "The movie, written and directed by Jeremy Leven, may not be one for the ages, but it's a pleasant, involving experience that intermixes fairy-tale romance with modern, deadpan comedy.", "Though the material is thin, the actors do seem to be getting a kick out of playing off each other.", "The film's greatest asset is its glorious acting, with special accolades to Brando, who here delivers yet another magnificent \"comeback\" performance.", "It's a joy to see Brando throwing himself into the spirit of the thing, ardently courting his perplexed wife of 30 years, a ravished Dunaway (they share a lovely five-minute bed scene -- in one, uninterrupted take).", "Don Juan is a glorious nut-case, played well by Depp, who mixes a faux nobleman's hauteur with an air of gentleness and longing. The film gets off track only when it makes him too self-aware.", "It benefits not only from Mr. Brando's peculiar presence, but also from Johnny Depp, who again proves himself a brilliantly intuitive young actor with strong ties to the Brando legacy.", "What a bizarro trio!", "If ever there was a movie that is more enjoyable than it has any right to be on the surface, it's this one.", "Although flawed in many respects -- it's not as smooth and silky a movie as it could have been -- Don Juan DeMarco nevertheless evokes a romantic mood that tickles and caresses; in a way, it's a movie version of spring fever.", "The movie certainly has its charming moments, but it's also so desperate to appear charming that the hard work begins to wear you down.", "It is hard to think of another actor who could bring off Don Juan De Marco, as Johnny Depp has. With his voice like a caress and eyes that gently preen, he is entirely believable as a consummate seducer, who yet remains sweet and sincere.", "", "Iconoclastic acting by Marlon Brando, Johnny Depp and Faye Dunaway elevate this likable comedy about love, illusion and delusion way above its inconsequential text.", ""], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "3/5", "2/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "A-", "", "3/5", "", "", "3/5", "3/4", "1/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Sheila Johnston", "Barbara Shulgasser", "Peter Travers", "Peter Rainer", "Greg Muskewitz", "Roger Ebert", "Desson Thomson", "Hal Hinson", "Emanuel Levy", "Tom Charity", "Mick LaSalle", "Janet Maslin", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Chris Hicks", "Steve Davis", "Michael Wood", "Quentin Curtis", "Jake Euker", "Emanuel Levy", "Chuck O&#39;Leary"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Francisco Examiner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rolling Stone", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Sun-Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Francisco Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Deseret News (Salt Lake City)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Austin Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New York Review of Books", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent on Sunday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">F5 (Wichita, KS)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fantastica Daily"], "date": ["April 25, 2019", "March 4, 2019", "March 4, 2019", "March 4, 2019", "March 4, 2019", "March 4, 2019", "March 4, 2019", "March 4, 2019", "March 4, 2019", "March 4, 2019", "March 4, 2019", "March 4, 2019", "March 4, 2019", "March 4, 2019", "March 4, 2019", "August 15, 2018", "December 13, 2017", "January 19, 2007", "June 13, 2006", "October 21, 2005"]}}
