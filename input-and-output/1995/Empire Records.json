{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Joe (Anthony LaPaglia) runs Empire Records, an independent Delaware store that employs a tight-knit group of music-savvy youths. Hearing that the shop may be sold to a big chain, slacker employee Lucas (Rory Cochrane) bets a chunk of the store's money, hoping to get a big return. When this plan fails, Empire Records falls into serious trouble, and the various other clerks, including lovely Corey (Liv Tyler) and gloomy Deb (Robin Tunney), must deal with the problem, among many other issues.", "rating": "29", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Allan Moyle", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 1, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The biggest audience laugh at a recent showing came when a guy deadpanned, \"This movie speaks for our generation.\" The sun can't set too soon on this Empire.", "If Clerks were written by TV hacks, it might feel something like this.", "It was never on the cards that Allan Moyle, the director of Pump Up the Volume, would deliver an authentic study of modern youth with his new film Empire Records.

It's a fun, immensely enjoyable celebration of the irrepressible optimism of youth.", "A sweetheart of a movie, enough to make up for its clattering screenplay.", "It's high on charm and low on quality; the writing is pedestrian at best, the characters are paper-thin, and director Allan Moyle lets the music do the heavy lifting.", "Insubstantial, predictable and often dull.", "A soundtrack in search of a movie, Empire Records is one teen-music effort that never finds a groove.", "One of the hippest and most enjoyable movies of the 90s.
