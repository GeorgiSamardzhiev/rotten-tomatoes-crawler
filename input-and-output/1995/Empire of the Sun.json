{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Jamie Graham (Christian Bale), a privileged English boy, is living in Shanghai when the Japanese invade and force all foreigners into prison camps. Jamie is captured with an American sailor named Basie (John Malkovich), who looks out for him while they are in the camp together. Even though he is separated from his parents and in a hostile environment, Jamie maintains his dignity and youthful spirits, providing a beacon of hope for the others held captive with him.", "rating": "75", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 32m", "director": "Steven Spielberg", "studio": "WarnerBrothers/SevenArts", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 25, 2016", "box_office": "$22.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...the story is a chilly one, particularly for a filmmaker who had so shamelessly (and skillfully) plucked heartstrings.", "The great industrial product becomes a mediocre artistic object.
