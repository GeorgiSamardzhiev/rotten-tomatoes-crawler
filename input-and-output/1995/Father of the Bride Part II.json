Shaken by nearing this new milestone in his life, George soon has to process even more surprising news -- his wife, Nina (Diane Keaton), is pregnant too. Reeling from these revelations, George gets help from the eccentric Franck (Martin Short), who, conveniently, has moved from planning weddings to baby showers.", "rating": "50", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Charles Shyer", "studio": "SandollarProductions,TouchstonePictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 13, 2017", "box_office": "$76.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["I like the sequel as well as the original", "Like a trained monkey, Martin Short is trotted back out for more of his mincing shtick.
