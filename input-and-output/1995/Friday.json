{"metadata": {"synopsis": "It's Friday and Craig Jones (Ice Cube) has just gotten fired for stealing cardboard boxes. To make matters worse, rent is due, he hates his overbearing girlfriend, Joi (Paula Jai Parker), and his best friend, Smokey (Chris Tucker), owes the local drug dealer money -- and that's all before lunch. As the hours drag on, Jones and Smokey experience the gamut of urban life, complete with crackheads, shoot-outs and overly sexual pastors, concentrated into one single, unbelievable Friday.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 31m", "director": "", "studio": "NewLineCinema", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 1, 2010", "box_office": "$27.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Crapping jokes and cussing jokes and look at that lady in her skimpy clothes jokes. I enjoyed this badly, stupidly, as it was meant to be enjoyed.", "While the character-driven script has a weakness for toilet humor (Mel Brooks would be proud), its inhabitants are given some oddball quirks and tics that keep things percolating when the plot development runs a little thin.", "The characters are what make this. Deebo is iconic.", "Really funny, filmed great, with a lot of heart to it.", "I knew the picture was in trouble when its first gag involved an old lady spewing obscenities.", "Co-scriptwriters Ice Cube, DJ Pooh, and director F. Gary Gray find as much humor in well-observed detail as in the oddities of the film's world.", "Friday has energy, and sass, and the nerve to suggest that the line between tragedy and comedy may be in the bloodshot eye of the beholder.", "The original installment in the outrageous slacker trilogy starring Ice Cube.", "A new generation of black talent (director Gray, actors Chris Tucker and Ice Cube) bring verve to this much welcome comedic view of street life in South Central, after mostly crime and drug pictures set there.", "A crudely made, sometimes funny bit of porchfront humor from the 'hood.", "Synthesizes blaxploitation and pot-comedy genres and melds them into a colossus of unending laughs.", "It has a certain crude, rambling charm.", "", "", "Cube's charm and Tucker's frantic antics can carry the movie only so far before the wall-to-wall profanity, constant vulgar humor and male chauvinist ogling wear out their welcome.", "...much of the humor sailed right over my caucasian head.", "Gray's direction is painfully flat, and curiously -- especially for a popular music video director like Gray -- lacking any interesting visual style.", "Turns \"Boyz N'The Hood\" on it's head...simply hilarious", "This is a ruder, cruder version of the hip-hop movie House Party, and it offers a fascinating glimpse at the way street life enters pop culture.", "Hilarious hip-hop ghetto comedy.
