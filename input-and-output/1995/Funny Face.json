{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Dispatched on an assignment, New York City-based fashion photographer Dick Avery (Fred Astaire) is struck by the beauty of Jo Stockton (Audrey Hepburn), a shy bookstore employee he's photographed by accident, who he believes has the potential to become a successful model.

The plot, such as it is, is full of lighthearted fun.", "What is startling here is the eye-popping colour, the self-reflexive photography and visual effects, the dance sequences (Fred Astaire with his umbrella), and the witty and ingenious use of the Paris locations.", "If you're prepared to do a bit of revisionist thinking, it all makes sense.", "Astaire could still dance up a storm, no doubt about it, and this has its moments.", "It's an intermittently charming trifle with directorial style to burn in the place of any kind of satisfactory substance.", "A timeless musical treat and the most fun you can have with really elegant clothes on.", "One of Hollywood's funniest, most stylish musicals, this breezy satire from 1957 thrives on the pairing of Fred Astaire and Audrey Hepburn.", "...a sporadically engaging yet hopelessly erratic old-school musical.", "Sensation trumps cogitation-unsurprising in a Hollywood production-which doesn't negate the enduring allure of this beautiful bauble.", "Bubbly, fashion-crazed Hepburn-Astaire musical.", "Of her iconic films, Hepburn shines the most in Funny Face by focusing on what makes her beautiful.", "...can clunk like a tin can in the dryer. But hey, we're talking Audrey Hepburn and Fred Astaire, so that's some mighty elegant slack we're willing to cut here.", "Despite some memorable musical numbers, gorgeous sets and energy galore, there's something about Funny Face that wasn't working for me, and it wasn't just the absurd idea about Audrey Hepburn being a frumpy bore.", "I didn't appreciate every song-and-dance sequence, yet I could hardly keep my eyes off the screen for all the showy merriment going on."], "rating": ["7/10", "", "", "3/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "5/5", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "5/5", "2/4", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "7/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Whitehall", "Clyde Gilmour", "Christopher Lloyd", "Josh Larsen", "Isabel Quigly", "Kate Muir", "Geoffrey Macnab", "Charlotte O&#39;Sullivan", "Peter Bradshaw", "David Jenkins", "David Parkinson", "Simon Kinnear", "David Nusair", "Keith Uhlich", "Charles Cassady", "Kevin Carr", "Mark Bourne", "Ryan Cracknell", "John J.
