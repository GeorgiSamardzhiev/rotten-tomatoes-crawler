The art of it blew me away.", "Identity issues in the cyber age actually make Ghost in the Shell seem extraordinarily prescient. The particulars may be off, but the emotional reality constructed by the 1995 film adaptation feels dead-on.", "Mamoru Oshii's Ghost in the Shell will always strike a chord with those directly affected by bodily displacement.", "Ghost in the Shell is a masterpiece of transhumanism-themed science fiction and should be on the list of anyone who enjoys complex narratives as well as incredible action.", "Ghost in the Shell is one of the few true watershed moments of anime here in the West...", "The technological advances that Ghost in the Shell made over 20 years ago still are vibrant on the screen, that great blend of digital and traditional animation.", "The drawing style is remarkable in a story that reveals a Japanese preoccupation with roboticized culture and hard-edged sexuality.", "An excellent science fiction story that has a lot to say about human nature. [Full review in Spanish]", "... Oshii's dazzling science fiction work mixes adventure, mystery, and metaphysics in a future where humans are routinely augmented with bionics and electronic implants, and then follows it into the next evolutionary step.", "Ghost in the Shell creates a prescient vision of a connected world, a speculative character study and a piece of social commentary regarding the international marketplace.", "A powerhouse marriage of sight and sound.", "It's an anime masterpiece that works both as an action film and a very evocative and thought provoking science fiction thriller.", "Most alluring are the crumbling neon cityscapes, real world/cyberspace fusion and the musings on identity.", "A melancholic Japanese classic whose influence proved far-reaching.", "Occasionally Ghost in the Shell shows its age and the added CGI elements, while appropriate for the story, also help make this film feel more dated than it might have otherwise.", "Ghost In The Shell is an ultra-violent, rocket-paced film-over and out in just over 80 minutes-but it's a poetic one, too.", "Ghost in the Shell stands as one of the pioneering films of anime history, one that captures the imagination with its intricate story and dazzles the eyes with its gorgeous animation."], "rating": ["5/5", "8/10", "", "", "", "5/5", "9/10", "A-", "4/5", "3/4", "3.5/4", "", "", "8/10", "", "4/5", "4/5", "7/10", "4/5", "3.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Andrew Heskins", "Mike Massie", "Charles Solomon", "Kathi Maio", "Dan Schindel", "Willow Maclay", "Michelle Kisner", "Nathanael Hood", "Sean Mulvihill", "Gene Siskel", "Sebastian Zavala Kahn", "Sean Axmaker", "Benjamin Wang", "Christian Villagomez", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Jamie Graham", "Allan Hunter", "J.C.
