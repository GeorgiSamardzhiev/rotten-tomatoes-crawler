[Full Review in Spanish]", "Partly because of the cast, partly because of the effects, partly because of Elmer Bernstein's score, and partly because of [Ivan] Reitman's directing style, it all just worked -- and it still does", "Despite the flaws I've dwelled on here, I feel real affection for Ghostbusters. How could you not? It's goofy, funny, homey - it's genuine comfort food", "...an erratic yet consistently entertaining summer blockbuster...", "Ghostbusters is like romping through Disneyland's haunted house with Bill Murray.", "Ghostbusters is primarily a showcase for Murray, who slinks through the movie muttering his lines in his usual cheeky fashion and getting off an occasionally hilarious crack that proves he's thoroughly enjoying himself.", "The plotting may be primitive, but it's all carried off with far more style and finesse than one might expect from the creators of Animal House and Meatballs.", "It's almost impossible not to smile while watching it.", "Part of the sheer joy of this movie -- aside from the comic timing of Bill Murray -- is the cartoonish crapness of its apparitions and their placid acceptance by the Ghostbusters team.", "What you realise about Ghostbusters thirty years on is that Bill Murray is a comedy genius.", "It speaks to its entire audience, without ever seeming to joke over children's heads in a snide or overly knowing manner.", "The elastic structure provides ample room for inspired surrealism, yet the looseness never compromises the film's tongue-in-cheek love letter to pre-gentrification Manhattan or its piercing satire of Reaganite go-getting ...", "Thirty years later, there are still rumblings of making another sequel, but no one would dare suggest a reboot or re-imagining; Ghostbusters is perfect exactly as it is.", "If you've never experienced GHOSTBUSTERS on the big screen, you really need to go see this. If not I'm afraid you'll have to turn in your geek card.", "On balance, Ghostbusters is a hoot. It's Murray's picture, and in a triumph of mind over matter, he blows away the film's boring special effects with his one-liners.", "A fantasy, but with no touches of reality at all, to be enjoyed for its zany humour typical of the \"National Lampoon\" school from which several of its contributors are drawn.", "Ghostbusters thrives on the fine line between taking it all seriously enough to be scary, then poking fun at it in the most creative ways possible.", "GHOSTBUSTERS is a movie that I've seen well over a hundred times and I'm still not sick of it, nor do I think I ever will. It's an iconic comedy that I think has held up very well over the past 30 years.", "If for nothing else, deserves to be fondly remembered for bringing the Stay Puft Marshmallow Man into the world."], "rating": ["7/10", "", "", "4/5", "3/4", "3/4", "3/4", "", "4/4", "4/5", "7/10", "5/5", "5/5", "4.0/4", "1", "", "", "A", "4/4", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Juan Luis Caviaro", "Zaki Hasan", "Rob Gonsalves", "David Nusair", "Joseph Gelmis", "Kathleen Carroll", "Arthur Knight", "Scott Nash", "Kate Muir", "Brian Henry Martin", "Hannah McGill", "Simon Kinnear", "Kevin A.
