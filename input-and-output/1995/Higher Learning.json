{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In John Singleton's powerful portrait of college life in the 1990s, a group of incoming freshmen at Columbus University -- including varsity athlete Malik Williams (Omar Epps), awkward outcast Remy (Michael Rapaport) and wide-eyed Kristen Connor (Kristy Swanson) -- struggle to find themselves and adjust to newfound independence. When Remy finds acceptance among a group of neo-Nazis, tensions rise even higher on a campus already divided along racial, socio-economic and gender lines.", "rating": "45", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 7m", "director": "John Singleton", "studio": "NewDealProductions,ColumbiaPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$36.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["I felt like it was lengthy, and they could have chopped down some of this stuff while trying to appeal to everyone...Malik and Remy could have been the movie right there.", "What is high...what is learning...yes it's a pretty decent cast, but it's all over the place, and I really wanted it to end.", "It was too schematic, too didactic and too cliched to work.", "Cole Hauser is chillingly effective as the white supremacist skinhead who reveals Rapaport's potential for violence, while Jennifer Connelly gives the most adult performance as a worldly-wise lesbian.", "Good intentions, but dull and predictable.", "Higher Learning sells its soul (and its brain) for overwrought melodrama.", "The film lapses into polarized melodrama but it's a handsome piece, displaying a fair understanding of our desperate need to belong.", "Singleton gets points for exposing the hypocrisy of \"politically correct\" institutions, but stilted dialogue and cardboard characterizations undermine the message.", "Despite some likable performances (Epps is especially winning), the drama in Higher Learning is constricted, hemmed in by Singleton's compulsion to view his characters as walking paradigms of racial and sexual politics.", "Higher Learning has a great many things on its mind, which immediately places it in a rather exclusive category of American films these days.", "A stylish, intelligent film-maker, Singleton interweaves the threads of his demographic tapestry with assurance, passion and a welcome awareness of the complexities of the college community's contradictory impulses towards integration and separatism.", "There's some nice ideas and realistically felt characters here.", "For anyone who's been to USC, it's a pretty hilarious parody of life there.
