{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Fast-talking con man Kevin Franklin (Sinbad) is in over his head: He owes $50,000 to the mob, and they want to collect. On the run, Franklin happens upon lawyer Gary Young (Phil Hartman) and his family, who are waiting for an old friend Young hasn't seen in 25 years. Taking the opportunity for another con -- and to save his neck -- Franklin convinces Young he's the old friend and becomes the family's houseguest. He has a great hideout from the mob, but the Mafia henchmen are still on his trail.", "rating": "14", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Randall Miller", "studio": "HollywoodPictures,CaravanPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 14, 2015", "box_office": "$26.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Sinbad is a genial soul and his goodwill remains untouched by the mostly amateurish Houseguest.", "Comedy at its most formulaic.", "", "", "Waste of Phil Hartman and Sinbad", "", "", "", "Who decided Sinbad needed to star in a movie and what should we do to them when we find out?", "", "Tedious and unfocused...the contrivance in this forgettable comedy is inexplicably unbearable", "Turns out to be an inane fish-out-of-water comedy.
