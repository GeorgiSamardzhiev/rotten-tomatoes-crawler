{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Jeffrey (Steven Weber), a gay man living in New York City with an overwhelming fear of contracting AIDS, concludes that being celibate is the only option to protect himself. As fate would have it, shortly after his declaration of a sex-free existence, he meets the handsome Steve Howard (Michael T. Weiss), his dream man -- except for his HIV-positive status. Facing this dilemma, Jeffrey turns to his best friend (Patrick Stewart) and an outrageous priest (Nathan Lane) for guidance.", "rating": "68", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Gay & Lesbian", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Christopher Ashley", "studio": "TheBookingOffice,Workin&#39;ManFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 28, 2019", "box_office": "$3.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["For those few things that don't really work, the rest of it does.
