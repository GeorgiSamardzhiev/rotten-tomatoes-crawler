{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the crime-plagued future, the only thing standing between order and chaos is Judge Joseph Dredd (Sylvester Stallone). His duty: police the violent metropolitan sprawls that crowd the decaying earth, and kill criminals on the spot if necessary. The tables are turned, however, when maniacal ex-Judge Rico (Armand Assante) frames Dredd for murder. But, as his opponents soon discover, not even a prison sentence can stop Dredd from doling out his signature brand of justice.", "rating": "20", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "Danny Cannon", "studio": "HollywoodPictures,CinergiPicturesEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$34.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Accomplishes numerous visual feats, from the gruesome makeup effects for the denizens of the Cursed Earth to the flying car chases across the neon cityscapes.", "As a piece of pure production, [Judge Dredd] needs to be heralded as one of the best achievements of the '90s.
