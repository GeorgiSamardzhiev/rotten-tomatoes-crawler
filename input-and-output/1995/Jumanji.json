What they discover is that you don't just play Jumanji - you must survive it.

It's a wretched remake that exists for no particular reason.", "Kasdan knows this is all about his stars' charisma, and keeps them bouncing off each other in pleasing ricochets.", "It works as entertainment and it is respectful to the first installment without falling into the error of trying to make a remake.

And at that, it is successful.
