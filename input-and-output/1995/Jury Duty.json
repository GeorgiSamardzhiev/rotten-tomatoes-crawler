{"metadata": {"synopsis": "An unemployed male stripper and certifiable slacker, Tommy Collins (Pauly Shore) ends up homeless when his mom throws him out of their trailer. Desperate for a place to stay, Collins figures that landing a spot on a jury should get him a roof over his head, food in his belly and a few bucks in his pocket. Shockingly, his plan works -- and he will do anything to delay the trial's verdict so he can keep living large and make his moves on knockout juror Monica (Tia Carrere).", "rating": "0", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "John Fortenberry", "studio": "TriStarPictures,TriumphFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$14.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The smartest thing going for this dumdum comedy is that it opens while the real-life jury in the O.J.
