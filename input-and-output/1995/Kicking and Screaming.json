{"metadata": {"synopsis": "As a child, Phil Weston (Will Ferrell) was never able to live up to the demands of his overbearing father, Buck (Robert Duvall), who wanted Phil to be an athlete. Now a parent himself, Phil has inherited his father's competitive nature, while his son, Sam (Dylan McLaughlin), has inherited Phil's lack of athletic talent. Serving as Sam's soccer coach, Phil hopes to turn his last-place team of losers into champions, so they can beat the rival team coached by Buck.", "rating": "41", "genre": "Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 34m", "director": "Jesse Dylan", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "May 13, 2005", "dvd_date": "Jul 3, 2012", "box_office": "$52.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["As disjointed as the whole thing is, it's often funny and, on a certain level, endearing.", "There is a bit of heart in Kicking and Screaming, with Ferrell and Duvall both giving nice performances.", "Just too awkward and clunky to be enjoyable.", "You may have to be dragged kicking and screaming to see this silly kiddie footie flick.", "It's all kept light and funny, but underlying the broad sight gags is a movie that actually has something to say about competition, fathers and sons, machismo and caffeine.", "Is this all there is to Ferrell's career? Mediocre comedies, and wasted talent?", "Director Jesse Dylan, desperate to avoid yawns, flails madly with staging, editing, slow motion -- any trick he can think of, whether it fits or works or not.", "If this footy film was in a league it would be languishing at the bottom of the Vauxhall Conference.", "Will Ferrell has become the most unlikely embodiment of wholesome family fun since Fred MacMurray gave up film noir for My Three Sons.", "The picture is a little about soccer, a little about parenting, and a lot about laughing. Mike Ditka shows up and delivers a kick-butt performance.", "Kicking & Screaming succeeds because it understands its target audience, refraining from playing it too cute or crude. Though predictable, it's well executed.", "Mostly useless", "Will Ferrell cria um personagem carism\u00e1tico a partir de um roteiro burocr\u00e1tico e, no processo, consegue divertir e levar o espectador a se envolver com a hist\u00f3ria.", "... Kicking & Screaming is not very good.", "Kicking and Screaming feels as if it were callously vomited out by a machine, along with a couple of spare parts and some putrid grease.", "Robert Duvall is superb (his love of football is well-documented) and seems to really enjoy playing a comic variation of his sports-obsessed father in the classic The Great Santini.", "Gets the job done for its core audience of tots%u2014and for no one else.", "This isn't the worst setup for a kiddie comedy, but it proves that Ferrell alone can't carry a film.", "There are a few broad laughs and Ferrell is everything you would expect him to be - irritating, occasionally amusing and sometimes inspired", "Ferrell's a funny guy, that much is true, and his frequent adlibbing is always preferable to the scripted humour he delivers, but he's just not right to lead a film like this."], "rating": ["3.0/4", "B-", "2/4", "1/5", "", "", "2/5", "1/5", "", "2.5/4", "3.5/4", "2.5/4", "3/5", "1.5/5", "", "3/5", "C", "", "", "3"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Micheal Compton", "Matthew Lucas", "Eddie Harrison", "David Ansen", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Jim Lane", "Amber Wilkinson", "Stephen Garrett", "Ross Anthony", "Russ Breimeier", "Stefan Birgir Stefansson", "Pablo Villa\u00e7a", "Pete Vonder Haar", "Jeffrey M.
