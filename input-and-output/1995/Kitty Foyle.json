[Full review in Spanish]", "Rogers delivers an excellent performance -- sexy, sassy and smart -- but the film's pre-feminism aspirations date badly.", "Working woman comes into conflict with the upper class. More relevant than ever in the age of income inequality and the 1%.", "he sharpness and contemporary significance of Mr. Morley's commentary are missing. His Kitty was of real flesh and blood; this one is persuasive but fictitious.", "Although the movie is unashamedly a soppy chick flick, it's impossible not to be swept along by her romantic dilemmas.", "A minor classic and a very typical \"woman's picture\" of its day.", "Sam Wood, the El Supremo of Hollywood hackdom, squired this one to glory.", "It's an odd and unique testament to 1940s' zeitgeist, a period of hope and despair, both of which are reflected in Ms. Foyle.", "Despite its episodic, and at times, vaguely-defined motivation, picture on whole is a poignant and dramatic portraiture of a typical Cinderella girl's love story.", "As the working class Cinderella, Ginger Rogers gives a strong dramatic performance in one of the era's better women's pictures; subplot of pregnancy was controversial at the time."], "rating": ["", "2.5/4", "", "2.5/5", "", "4/4", "", "3/5", "", "B"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Elena de la Torre", "Matt Brunson", "Michael E.
