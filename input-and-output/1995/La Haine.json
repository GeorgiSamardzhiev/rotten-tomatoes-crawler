{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When a young Arab is arrested and beaten unconscious by police, a riot erupts in the notoriously violent suburbs outside of Paris. Three of the victim's peers, Vinz (Vincent Cassel), Said (Said Taghmaoui) and Hubert (Hubert Kound\u00e9), wander aimlessly about their home turf in the aftermath of the violence as they try to come to grips with their outrage over the brutal incident. After one of the men finds a police officer's discarded weapon, their night seems poised to take a bleak turn.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Mathieu Kassovitz", "studio": "LesProductionsLazennec,Canal+,KassoInc.Productions,EggPictures,PolyGramFilmedEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 23, 2017", "box_office": "$130.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Starkly funny, politically poignant, and extremely honest in its social portrayal, it endures as one of the greatest films of the 90s.", "One of the most important films of post-war French cinema.", "The young men may be cut from different ethnic and cultural backgrounds (Jewish, Black and Arab) but are united in their impoverished station and palpable frustration.", "It was a seminal film then, it's a seminal film now.", "A really charged, pulsating film shot in gorgeous black and white, and it still really holds up.", "Mathieu Kassovitz's account of police brutality is as ferocious a punch in the stomach as it was twenty-five years ago, and retains every spark of an explosive deconstruction of France's treatment of minorities and widening social inequality.", "La Haine is an unmissable response to an unending emergency.", "Unlike most films of the '90s, Matthieu Kassovitz's La Haine remains a timeless snapshot of a transitory decade that forever transformed world history.", "Well the setup may be a little plot-convenient... but sophomore director Mathieu Kassovitz (Cafe au Lait) has turned out a film that manages to be documentary-like and stylish at the same time and is certainly one to watch.", "La Haine chucks a Molotov cocktail through the sedate window-front of modern French cinema. Kassovitz has scoured away the layers of nuance and the portraits of a privileged past -- and daubed over them slogans of despair that are raw and contemporary.", "La Haine makes no bones about being anti-police, but Kassovitz's screenplay leaves plenty of room for nuance.", "Mathieu Kassovitz's gritty, documentary-like second film is a powerful comment on class and racial disparity.", "La Haine does not provide an easy answer. So you have to struggle intellectually for yourself.", "The conveniently manufactured ending is a let-down, but the display of raw emotion and kinetic energy lingers with the viewer long after the film is over.", "A layered conundrum that builds to a stunning crescendo, Mathieu Kassovitz's Hate is an extremely intelligent take on an idiotic reality: the mutual mistrust, contempt and hatred between the police and France's disenfranchised young citizens.", "An inspired achievement from Mathieu Kassovitz.", "to get an inside view of the situation, there simply is no better source than Kassovitz's disturbing urban study", "", "One would expect, from the initial look and feel, that this is a skin-head flic. It is so much more complex, though, covering a gammut of social strata within strata.", "One of the most blisteringly effective pieces of urban cinema ever made"], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "5/5", "8/10", "B+", "", "", "8/10", "8", "7/10", "", "4/5", "A", "4/5", "A-", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jordan M.
