{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Adapted from the novel by John O'Brien, this acclaimed drama follows alcoholic screenwriter Ben Sanderson (Nicolas Cage) as he drinks himself into oblivion in Las Vegas. When Ben meets the beautiful prostitute Sera (Elisabeth Shue), they strike up an unconventional relationship -- one where she can't ask him to curb his drinking, and he can't fault her for her job. Though they offer each other support, Ben's self-destruction threatens to eclipse their bond.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Mike Figgis", "studio": "LumiereProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 17, 2017", "box_office": "$29.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The movie contains career-best performances from Nicolas Cage... and Elisabeth Shue.", "A love story like no other, Mike Figgis's Leaving Las Vegas is a bleak, mesmerizing rhapsody of self-destruction, defiantly uninterested in peddling Hollywood-style uplift.", "This movie was like watching a car crash in slow motion. You knew there was going to be a crash, but I just wished it would just happen already, and not have spent two hours getting to the impact.", "What works, first and foremost, are the two lead performances.", "[Shue's] terrific (and Oscar-nominated), but the movie belongs to Cage whose fierce, uncompromising performance is as serious as a hangover and as jittery as the shakes. You can practically smell the stale reek of his booze-soaked breath.", "The artistic direction of Figgis keeps it honest and unsentimental.", "[VIDEO ESSAY] \"Leaving Las Vegas\" (1995) is a remarkably potent romantic drama that permanently altered the careers of many of the people involved in its creation.", "Dark and giddy at the same time, Leaving Las Vegas takes us into dreamy, intoxicated places no movie about an alcoholic has gone before.", "Figgis puts a desperate drunk front and center and demands we deal with him and the Jungian shadow he casts. [Blu-ray]", "We're not talking high, morally instructive tragedy here, just a hard lesson in postmodernist outlawry and its sad little anarchies.", "Figgis' film, one of the few to show the sleazy flip-side of the glossy city of Las Vega, offers an unblinking portrayal of alcoholism.", "The film pulls no punches, takes no prisoners and flies in the face of feel-good pictures.", "It's a relief when so dark a film refuses to preach, trusting the viewer to draw his own conclusions about the roots of America's self-destructive funk.", "The plot goes nowhere, but under the pornographic circumstances Figgis, Cage, and Shue all do fine jobs.", "Figgis presents disintegration as a state of grace.", "It certainly has the courage of its convictions.", "An uncompromising, surprisingly poignant skid-row love story.", "", "Grim yet compelling, downbeat but not really depressing, Mike Figgis' multi-nuanced portrait of an alcoholic, splendidly played by Oscar winner Nicholas Cage, is easily is most accomplished and haunting picture.", ""], "rating": ["", "", "B+", "3.5/5", "", "B+", "A", "A-", "3/4", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "5/5", "", "9/10", "5/5", "A-", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Ben Kuchera", "David Ansen", "Candice Frederick", "Tim Brayton", "Eleanor Ringel Cater", "Dennis Schwartz", "Cole Smithey", "Owen Gleiberman", "Peter Canavese", "Richard Schickel", "", "Leonard Klady", "Harlan Jacobson", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Rob Gonsalves", "Geoff Andrew", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "Laura Clifford", "Emanuel Levy", "Daniel M.
