He ignores the stranger's warning to never remove the statue's golden medallion and takes it for himself. Instantly the statue transforms into the murderous Leprechaun (Warwick Davis), who vows to kill anyone who takes his gold. Scott McCoy (John Gatins), who unwittingly took a gold coin from the pawn shop, and Tammy (Lee Armstrong), Scott's new friend, are first on the list.", "rating": "0", "genre": "Horror", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Brian Trenchard-Smith", "studio": "TrimarkPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The directness with which this went to video is apparent in nearly every single element.", "If \"Leprechaun\" 1 and 2 are clunky, why expect this one to be even as good?
