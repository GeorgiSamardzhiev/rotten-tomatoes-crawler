Perhaps not the cruder, formulaic elements of other Bond films, but the lightness of touch and inherent charm in the character of Bond himself.", "The movie is really well-structured, simple in plot but rather meaty in delivery.", "Some of 007's earlier adventures fail to hold up, but in a post-'Taken' world, 'Licence to Kill' certainly aged well and is a under-appreciated gem in the Bond catalog.", "Licence to Kill gets better as it unfolds for more than two hours. It just takes an insufferably long while to find the right pace.", "Licence to Kill ranks as one of the best of the 16 Bond films, thanks to Dalton's athletic, tough and deadly new 007.", "As unlikely as it seems, Mr. Dalton actually appears to be growing in the Bond role, which is potentially stifling because its own popularity has so rigidly defined it.", "This series' record of maintaining an admirable level of quality stays intact, even if this film might best be used as a cinematic appetizer to see before renting a tape of one of the Connery or Moore classics.", "Every once in a while, [the Bond series] pulls in its stomach, pops the gun from its cummerbund, arches its eyebrow and gets off another bull's-eye. The newest, Licence to Kill, is probably one of the five or six best of Bond.", "He may look the part, but Timothy Dalton fails the boots, the scuba gear, or the automobiles left him by Moore and Connery.", "If the series is ever going to return to its Connery-era glory, it definitely needs some new writers, ones who know how to streamline a story and keep the dialogue tight.", "Dalton revives the cool, ironic detachment of the Connery years, but he also allows a touch of obsession to show through Bond`s surface aplomb.", "With Dalton straightening out Bond for the second time, Licence to Kill continues the salvage operation begun in The Living Daylights and rescues a series that was in danger of shooting itself in the foot. With a Walther PPK, of course.", "It's a watchable adventure boosted by impressive action sequences and a fiery climax with a bone-crunching punch-up. Pity Dalton didn't have another crack at proving his secret-agent credentials.", "Darker version of James Bond has more violence, language.", "Anchored by an engaging revenge plot, this Bond film has a great villain, a dark tone and several top-notch action set pieces.", "No quips. No smirks. No innuendoes. Just raw, exposed nerves. The traits for which Dalton gets dinged are those looking past the character's admittedly alluring surface pleasures. Women aren't the only things that keep 007 awake at night, you know."], "rating": ["6/10", "4/5", "B+", "4/5", "3/5", "", "8/10", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "2/5", "", "3.5/4", "2.5/4", "3/5", "3/5", "3/4", "3.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Chris Stuckmann", "David Hogan", "PJ Nabarro", "Bob Sassone", "Jeffrey Lyles", "Candice Russell", "Gary Thompson", "David Sterritt", "Ralph Novak", "Michael Wilmington", "Tom Hibbert", "Jay Boyar", "Dave Kehr", "Desmond Ryan", "Jeremy Aspinall", "Jeffrey M.
