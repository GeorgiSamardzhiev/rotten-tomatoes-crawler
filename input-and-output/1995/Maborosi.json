{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Despite her outwardly happy and tranquil life as a wife and new mother, Yukimo (Makiko Esumi) is regularly troubled by a horrific nightmare about the death of her grandmother. When tragedy strikes her husband, Ikuo (Tadanobu Asano), the stress forces Yukimo into hermit-like solitude until a kindly widower (Takashi Nait\u00f4) attempts to draw her from her shell. This is the first scripted film by Japanese filmmaker Hirokazu Koreeda, who had previously been been known for his documentaries.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Hirokazu Koreeda", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's a very Japanese understanding of suicide: as not bluntly tragic or a waste, but alluring, mysterious, not subject to total comprehension ... the state of grief itself.", "A film of feelings and textures that establishes character without the need for traditional plot structures.", "Generally, this film engages more intellectually with emotion than Kore-eda's later more heartfelt work.", "Based on a prize-winning Japanese short story and much influenced by the styles of Yasujiro Ozu and Hou Hsiao-Hsien, this is a deeply felt film that eschews cheap sentiment and leaves one genuinely moved and unexpectedly uplifted.", "The camera rarely moves and yet there are images here as strikingly lovely as any you've seen and others as sweetly alive.", "It is a sombre and painful drama, enacted with reserve.", "Each character moves and speaks differently, shining with the complex inner life of a real person with real needs, real memories, real thoughts.", "A pure pleasure to watch.", "The tale is told in contemplative wide-angle shots; the absence of any spurious, unearned intimacy with the characters makes the climactic scenes profoundly moving.", "", "", "[Hirokazu's] also one of the most empathetic filmmakers, softly guiding viewers through his meditations on life and death.", "Widow tries to find out why her husband killed himself. Slow-paced but moving Japanese drama.", "", "The film uses natural lighting exclusively, eschewing staged settings as often as possible and keeping some nighttime scenes entirely in the dark, an eerie mirror to Yumiko's wounded heart.", "A superior film.", "The film, which was made with only natural light, draws the viewer into its spiritual mood with one breathtaking shot after another, as the camera draws back to contemplate Yumiko from afar.", "Though the audience always remains at a distance, both physical and emotional, from Yumiko, her sense of loss and her inner journey are made vivid by purely filmic means.", "This is a powerful and profound Japanese film about one woman's long and arduous journey through grief's labyrinth.", "Maborosi is by no means perfect -- it drags a little and leaves a few more unanswered questions than it really needs -- but it contains some very perfect moments."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "3.5/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "3/5", "A", "3/5", "5/5", "3.5/5", "A-", "", "3.5/5", "", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["CJ Sheu", "Matthew Lucas", "Amber Wilkinson", "David Parkinson", "Mark Sinker", "Peter Bradshaw", "Bilge Ebiri", "Jeffrey M.
