{"metadata": {"synopsis": "On vacation at a beautiful lake in British Columbia, Ashley (Sarah Wayne) and Joshua (Joshua Jackson), the children of workaholic radio host Jack Black (Mark Harmon), learn about its mythical inhabitant, a sea monster named Orky.

They try to save Orky with the help of an elderly Native American (Frank Sotonoma Salsedo).", "rating": "21", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Rick Stevenson", "studio": "TriStarPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$2.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A singularly unconvincing parable, ultimately hamstrung by awkward, choppy storytelling.", "On the minus side are a heavy-handed dose of political correctness and a needless flight into dubious whimsy in an already fanciful situation.", "[A] mildly entertaining fantasy.", "If Magic in the Water had been written smarter, both children and adults would have enjoyed it more.", "Orky is very concerned with the environment and can repair relationships between parents and children. But Orky cannot save this movie.", "Orky isn't shown until near the end, and then only briefly. At first, I thought this was an attempt to build suspense, but after a while, I began to suspect that the high cost of sea-monster footage was the real explanation.", "A formulaic (think Free Willy meets Loch Ness) but pleasant enough family film.", "The result is a slice of delightful escapism that will enchant children and entertain parents as well.", "'Magic in the Water' will probably appeal mostly to viewers who crave unsophisticated family-oriented entertainment, not matter how hokey it is.", "Director Rick Stevenson and co-writer Icel Dobell Massey tell their fanciful story with an appreciable amount of wit and imagination.", "", "", "", "", "A film likely to delight only the youngest moviegoers.", "Free Willy and E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial are the obvious inspirations for Magic in the Water, a tepid family fantasy that replaces those child-friendly creatures for a sort of Canadian Loch Ness Monster.", "Despite these cliches, director and co-screenwriter Rick Stevenson has created some original moments.", "You can probably see this movie without doing any major damage, but you and yours will have much more fun reading together from the collected works of Dr. Seuss.", "There's definitely something in the water here, but magic...?", "If dying of boredom was possible, this movie would be lethal."], "rating": ["", "", "", "1.5/4", "1/4", "1/5", "", "3/5", "", "", "2/5", "3/5", "3/10", "1/5", "", "", "", "", "", "0/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Kevin Thomas", "David Sterritt", "Gene Siskel", "Jami Bernard", "Jay Boyar", "Daniel Etherington", "David Aldridge", "Betty Jo Tucker", "Joe Leydon", "Emanuel Levy", "Linda Cook", "Dragan Antulov", "Jeffrey Westhoff", "Kim Williamson", "Chris Hicks", "John F.
