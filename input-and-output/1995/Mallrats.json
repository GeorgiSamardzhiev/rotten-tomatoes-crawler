{"metadata": {"synopsis": "T.S. (Jeremy London) and his best friend, Brodie (Jason Lee), take a trip to the mall after their girlfriends break up with them. T.S.'s girlfriend, Brandi (Claire Forlani), is participating in a dating game show at the mall, which was the initial cause of their breakup. Meanwhile, Brodie's ex, Rene (Shannen Doherty), has begun dating sleazy store manager Shannon (Ben Affleck). T.S. and Brodie seek out ways to ruin the game show, hunted all the while by Brandi's father, Jared (Michael Rooker).", "rating": "57", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Kevin Smith", "studio": "UniversalPictures,AlphavilleFilms,ViewAskewProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$1.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["While Mallrats does play better now than when it was originally released, it still rests below a handful of more accomplished titles in Smith's View Askewniverse.", "London and Lee expertly lead this cast of \"misfit toys\" in an appropriate follow up to Smith's debut, Clerks.", "Thin yet enticing.", "How can a reviewer write about a movie that makes Dumb and Dumber seem like a Merchant-Ivory production?", "Smith manages to successfully subsume his slackers feel into a more cartoony aesthetic.
