{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This film update of the \"Maverick\" TV series finds the title cardsharp (Mel Gibson) hoping to join a poker contest with an impressive payoff. In order to enter, Maverick must first put up a large cash sum. He scams hopeful contestants Annabelle (Jodie Foster) and Angel (Alfred Molina) in a preliminary card game to win the money he needs, making enemies of both players. While trying to evade Annabelle and Angel, the crafty Maverick realizes a cunning marshal (James Garner) is also on his tail.", "rating": "66", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Western", "runtime": "2h 9m", "director": "Richard Donner", "studio": "WarnerBros.,Donner/Schuler-Donner,IconEntertainmentInternational", "theater_date": "May 20, 1994", "dvd_date": "May 1, 2008", "box_office": "$101.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The script is notionally based on the old television series of the same name, but the screenwriter William Goldman, has produced something depressingly up to date in its incoherence, its crisis of confidence served up with a sickly grin.", "Maverick is quintessential summer fare, an unpretentious no-brainer that relies mostly on the star wattage of Gibson, Foster and old reliable James Garner.", "[Maverick] succeeds, just barely, on the good will of its stars and the sumptuousness of its Western locations.", "By the time Donner crowds his climactic poker game with a bevy of veteran Western character actors, decades of movie tradition have been reduced to window dressing, and Maverick leaves you hungry for the real thing.", "[Gibson and Garner] can make you smile contentedly even when the script is wandering and they're just sort of standing around waiting for its next good part to develop.", "Maverick is smart-alecky without being very smart. It's full of spoofy, har-dee-har-har ribaldries -- this film practically winks at you.", "This movie doesn't have the wry kick of the TV show at its best. Too rich, too loaded, Maverick may have misplayed its cards, kept its eyes on the pot instead of the players. In movies, as in poker, you can't always trust a pat hand.", "Goldman and director Richard Donner don't know when to stop mining a gag and to move on. That the film runs in excess of two hours is indicative of the filmmakers' love affair with scenes that don't work.", "It's cleverly crafted, and you can't help enjoying it even when you know it's manipulating you as brazenly as a poker dealer with tricky fingers and a well-stacked deck.", "Somewhere about halfway through Hour Two, you might find yourself looking at your watch and wondering, 'Like, when is this movie going to begin?'", "We can close the competition for the most entertaining of the current spate of feature movies based on old TV shows.", "Maverick never takes itself seriously, which establishes the tone for serious fun. Goldman's screenplay is a model of ingenuity, setting increasingly complicated traps for the three leads, and rather amazed that they wriggle free.", "Maverick reminds us of what killed the western in the first place.", "Despite the attention of master scriptwriter William Goldman, this gentle tribute to the hit comedy western TV series missed a golden opportunity for a razor-sharp spoof. There's no doubt the stars had a ball, though.", "Facetious and cynical, Mel Gibson's star vehicle is glossy and superficially enteratining, but doesn't begin to approximate the charm of James Garner and the original TV series.", "True deft wit is just plum missing from this good-natured, flat-footed, eager-to- please, tee-hee Western.", "...an easygoing diversion that could've (and should've) been so much better...", "This one has it all - romance, comedy, action and high-spirited adventure!", "See website for more details.", "Everyone on board seems to be having enormous fun."], "rating": ["", "3/4", "", "2/4", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "3.5/4", "2/5", "3/5", "B-", "B-", "2.5/4", "3/5", "8/10", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Adam Mars-Jones", "Gary Thompson", "Gene Siskel", "Jeff Shannon", "Richard Schickel", "Peter Rainer", "Michael Wilmington", "Candice Russell", "David Sterritt", "Stephen Hunter", "", "Carrie Rickey", "Jay Boyar", "David Parkinson", "Emanuel Levy", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "David Nusair", "Caffeinated Clint", "Rory L.
