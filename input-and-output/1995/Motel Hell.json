{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Vincent Smith (Rory Calhoun) and his sister Ida (Nancy Parsons) run a rural hotel, but they earn most of their cash operating a food stand that specializes in world-famous sausages. After years of success, however, the duo's upstanding brother, Sheriff Bruce (Paul Linke), eventually discovers the grotesque details of his siblings' booming business: Vincent and Ida are actually plumping up their hotel patrons, killing and dismembering them and then grinding them into frankfurters.", "rating": "71", "genre": "Comedy/Horror", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Kevin Connor", "studio": "CampHill", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Motel Hell retains its own brand of madness by being eerie and holding onto its satirical humour.", "Just on sheer chutzpah, it's got to be one of the most wholly worthwhile American horror films of the early 1980s.", "Motel Hell is a rather well-executed dark comedy that plays it fairly straight, much thanks to the outstanding performances from Calhoun & Parsons who give the film a nice sense of gravity against the film's more cartoonish supporting characters.", "The movie is slapsticky and obvious, but it includes one genuinely nightmarish concept: Vincent and Ida cultivate a secret garden of moaning and gurgling burlap sacks -- bags that cover the heads of the couple's buried-to-the-neck victims.", "A perverse film, both in its humor and its horror.", "[Blu-ray Review] For genre fans of the offbeat, horrific and tongue-in-cheek, Scream Factory's impressively packed Collector's Edition Blu-ray release of \"Motel Hell\" is worth seeking out.", "...a low-budget shocker that's picked up a sizable cult following over the years, thanks in no small part to Calhoun, whose welcoming smile and aging matinee-idol looks made his turn as a villainous madman fond of human flesh all that more effective.", "As always, Shout! Factory has done an admirable job restoring the film to optimal quality and providing a ton of fascinating in-depth extras, but it's not nearly enough to cover up the fact that the film simply wasn't worth the trouble of digging up.", "It's meant to be weird, campy and funny but settles for being tasteless, gruesomely awkward and moronic.", "", "", "", "", "Motel Hell is a welcome change-of-pace; it's to The Texas Chainsaw Massacre as Airplane! is to Airport.", "People buried up to their necks and raised for food.
