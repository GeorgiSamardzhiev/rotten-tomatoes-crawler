{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Fifth Avenue socialite Irene Bullock (Carole Lombard) needs a \"forgotten man\" to win a scavenger hunt, and no one is more forgotten than Godfrey Park (William Powell), who resides in a dump by the East River. Irene hires Godfrey as a servant for her riotously unhinged family, to the chagrin of her spoiled sister, Cornelia (Gail Patrick), who tries her best to get Godfrey fired. As Irene falls for her new butler, Godfrey turns the tables and teaches the frivolous Bullocks a lesson or two.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Gregory La Cava", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 12, 2014", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This scintillating comedy was the first film to be Oscar-nominated in all four acting categories.", "It is a wonderful film with a conscientious mind.", "It remains one of the very best screwball comedies of the era, as well as one of the greatest movies ever made.", "An excellent farce, given an extremely lavish production; it should keep audiences laughing from the beginning to the very end.", "Arguably the best of these reliably eat-the-rich films...the film's satirical edge emerges from its pillorying of the propertied classes and the empty promise of economic recovery.", "A frothy, frivolous farce...", "It then turned out that My Man Godfrey was really about the class-struggle, not the best subject in the world for comedy. Best not to stay for the ending. It leaves you with the feeling that the whole thing was a waste of time.", "While My Man Godfrey is full of witty dialogue and classical direction, it's the film's social awareness that really stands out today.", "Gregory La Cava's warm and giddy carousel, a raucous burlesque with a beautiful still center, a lighter and tarter savior fable than Capra's concurrent transmutations of the Gospels", "Hasn't lost an ounce of its thematic resonance even after all these decades.", "There's a charm to both Powell and Lombard, making the film transcend generations. It's a cute movie that has fun with levels of wealth in society and sibling rivalry.", "My Man Godfrey emerges with that evasive quality that is not skillful playing, writing or direction, but something that mysteriously adds itself to these things, and makes a tip-top picture.", "A brilliantly executed screwball, full of both madcap humour and bitter satire.", "[A] screwball masterpiece.", "God, but this film is beautiful.", "Gregory La Cava's improvisational style received its highest critical acclaim for this 1936 film, a marginally Marxist exercise in class confusion during the Depression.", "William Powell and Carole Lombard are pleasantly teamed in this splendidly produced comedy.", "Director Gregory La Cava was a master of the sustained comedy.", "Its whimsical winning nature still comes through.", "The film has lost some of its allure over the years, but it's still streets and streets ahead of the addled whimsy favoured by latter-day Hollywood."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "", "1", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "9/10", "3/5", "", "", "", "4/4", "", "", "3.5/4", "B", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Matt Brunson", "Allen Almachar", "Mike Massie", "P.S.
