[But] director Prosit Roy does something clever...", "Not only does Pari shy away from drowning itself in the worst horror tropes but it also peppers the film's proceedings and story with quirks, and twists that although not unique, seem at least accomplished.", "Pari asks the big question - are human beings in fact the biggest monsters? I say the biggest horror is a lame script.", "It's rare to see a successful mainstream actress not only believe in this as a producer, but strip herself of beauty so fully that her hideousness becomes beguiling.", "Once Roy strips away the mystery from his characters, Pari loses its way, and it feels like a laboured finish to the end. Even those easily scared (like this reviewer) will find no need to avert their eyes.", "Pari is technically competent, and Prosit Roy receives production support in plenty. The costumes, hair and make -up, and background music being noteworthy....but themes of good versus evil and love limits this film's appeal to the loyal viewer.", "It's compelling, but leaves you eventually disturbed.", "Pari is the kind of horror that gags and chokes you with an incipient dread. But only up to a point...Roy makes it all too literal, with a righteous take on pregnancy and abortion. In an effort to find neat closure, the director spins a clumsy climax.", "Jishnu Bhattacharjee's innovative cinematography tries to cover-up, but he can't rescue a film that fails to explain its lead's sudden change of character.", "The film may not be outright horrid in terms of quality. However, in seeking to deliver an unending supply of heavy-handed chills and thrills, it goes all out without a safety net. It comes up short and falls with a thud.", "Anushka Sharma plays Rukhsana with a great deal of bloody enthusiasm. You cannot accuse her of not trying hard, but the film is so poorly-written, and so scatter-brained that nothing can rescue it.", "If you like horror as a genre, and prefer a genuine theme over sheer succession of scary sequences, you will like this one.", "A more dramatic story and tauter screenplay would have turned it into a true blue horror film. But in the present form, the only feeling it evokes is of sadness brought out by the fact that a brilliant opportunity got lost."], "rating": ["", "", "2/5", "3/5", "", "", "3/5", "", "1/5", "2/5", "1/5", "3.5/5", "2.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Sankhayan Ghosh", "Poulomi Das", "Anupama Chopra", "Rahul Desai", "Shilpa Jamkhandikar", "Udita Jhunjhunwala", "Manjusha Radhakrishnan", "Namrata Joshi", "Rohit Vats", "Saibal Chatterjee", "Shubhra Gupta", "Renuka Vyavahare", "Devesh Sharma"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Companion", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Qrius", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Companion", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Companion", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reuters", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Scroll.in", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gulf News (UAE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Hindu", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hindustan Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">NDTV", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Indian Express", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Times of India", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmfare"], "date": ["October 30, 2020", "July 16, 2019", "September 5, 2018", "September 5, 2018", "March 2, 2018", "March 2, 2018", "March 2, 2018", "March 2, 2018", "March 2, 2018", "March 2, 2018", "March 2, 2018", "March 2, 2018", "March 2, 2018"]}}
