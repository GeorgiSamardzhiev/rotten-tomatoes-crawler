Scott. For Scott is Patton incarnate in a superb acting performance that rescues the film from some of Schaffner's more pedestrian directing devices.", "True, we learn to hate Patton's guts, but we also learn to understand the pragmatic magnetism that caused his men to follow him anywhere.", "Naturally... we see all sides of Patton, but are exposed only to the more shallow surfaces of the other characters.", "George C. Scott makes for such an unstoppably watchable Patton that... he makes every single onscreen moment feels like the most vital thing you have ever seen in a movie.", "I'd like to pin four stars on each shoulder of George C. Scott for his perspective characterization of the military genius, the controversial man.", "The movie's vision blurs the man and, incidentally, the just war around him.", "Combining blimpish bluster with moments of monstrous ego and unexpected humanity, Scott makes this magnificent film unforgettable.", "Although I have sometimes complained about the length of movies, I wouldn't begrudge a single minute from Patton's nearly three hour running time.", "It's certainly a great performance from Scott, a seamless, pity-free portrayal.", "George C. Scott's performance cannot be praised highly enough for capturing both the violence and the vulnerability of the Patton personality without degenerating either into vulgar caricature or cardboard sentimentality.", "George C. Scott's intuitive, powerhouse performance paints a complex picture of a steadfast soldier that believed firmly in reincarnation, colorful language, and the glories of war.", "Scott is extraordinary -- intense, brazen, passionate.", "A bio-epic on the order of Lawrence of Arabia, Patton is a smart, even-handed, fully realized historical film. [Blu-Ray]", "Superb telling of WWII General George Patton, brilliantly played by George C. Scott.", "It's Scott's virtuoso performance that carries the film.", "War is hell, and Patton is one hell of a war picture, perhaps one of the most remarkable of its type ever made.", "An absorbing, polished character study powered by an epic performance.", "Scott is simply awesome as the one-of-a-kind General George Patton.", "Scott appears not to act, but to fully inhabit his role, from his profanity spewing down to the swagger of his walk."], "rating": ["1", "", "", "", "7/10", "4/4", "", "5/5", "4/4", "4/5", "", "4/5", "3.5/5", "4/4", "5/5", "B+", "", "", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Larry Zolf", "Michael Ross", "Lloyd Steele", "Tim Brayton", "Wanda Hale", "TIME Staff", "David Parkinson", "Scott Nash", "Andrew Lowry", "Andrew Sarris", "Jeffrey M.
