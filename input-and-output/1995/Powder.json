{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A mysterious albino teenager, Jeremy \"Powder\" Reed (Sean Patrick Flanery), is rescued from the basement in which he's lived since birth. But the extremely intelligent Reed is not welcomed into the community. Students at his school fear the outsider because of his bizarre ability to harness extrasensory perception and heal the sick. His relationship with a fellow student, Lindsey (Missy Crider), doesn't help matters either, despite the help of two teachers (Jeff Goldblum, Mary Steenburgen).", "rating": "50", "genre": "Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Victor Salva", "studio": "CaravanPictures,HollywoodPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 1, 2016", "box_office": "$30.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["'90s sci-fi fantasy has violence, cursing.", "", "", "", "Pretentious, uninvolving headscratcher that aims to be tragic and uplifting and falls way short; the only thing it'll lift is your butt from your seat midway through the film.", "Okay drama, could have been more moving", "", "", "", "Interesting film that's just a little too much like an expanded X Files episode", "Offbeat drama about a mystic with strange powers and a compassionate service of others.", "Powder has all of the elements of a successful fantasy, and none of the insights.
