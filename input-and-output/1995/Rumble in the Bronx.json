The same goes here.", "Chan's insistence on his own fallibility and vulnerability, taken with virtuoso scenes like the fight involving 101 domestic appliances, shows why he means more to his countless fans than six US action stars put together.", "", "Yes, the production values for support acting, dubbing, and photography are marginal, at best. But, the stunts and action sequences are a breath of fresh air when compared to the bloated, hi-tech Hollywood actioners we're seeing.", "Great action strung together by the weakest of plots.", "", "Some dizzyingly exciting action marks Chan's stateside debut.", "", "It's light on plot and character, but the stunts are well staged.", "", "", "A daft, but hugely enjoyable gangster romp.", "", "Whoever demands three-dimensional characters, thoughtful exploration of some important issues or even some semblance of plot from a movie should never watch Rumble in the Bronx.", "Great fun despite cheap, shoddy production and dubbing.", "It's Jackie Chan delivering tasty kung fu smackdown.
