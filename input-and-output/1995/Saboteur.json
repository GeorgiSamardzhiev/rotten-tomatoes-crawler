[Full Review in Spanish]", "To put it mildly, Mr. Hitchcock and his writers have really let themselves go. Melodramatic action is their forte, but they scoff at speed limits this trip.", "Like previous Hitchcock thrillers, this has the capacity to bring that high gulp in the throat.", "It looks like something warmed over, a melange of cops and robbers and romance with Freudian traces, prepared with a kind of casual confidence that It would get by on Its flashes at cleverness. It doesn't.", "[Saboteur] will keep audiences sitting upright.", "Here again is Alfred Hitchcock the screen's supreme master of suspense.", "It doesn't really work this time, perhaps because of the weaknesses of the stars and the shapelessness of the chase plot, but there are wonderful asides on the equivalence of patriotism and paranoia and on the erotic fascination of guilt.", "Dorothy Parker contributed to the screenplay of this cracking Hitchcock thriller, which cleverly served the dual purpose of warning Americans against Fifth Columnists and providing some much needed escapism.", "Saboteur's ingredients are not uncommon, but Master Hitchcock deals them out in a sinister manner that makes them appear so.", "Wonderfully creative spy thriller, with strong point of view.", "Soldiers on patrol behind cafeteria workers, Fascist-sympathizing terrorists deeply embedded in small towns and big cities, and the chilling crackle of hectic radio warnings set a tone of ambient menace.", "This political thriller, Hitchcock's contribution to American propaganda during WWII, is not one of the master's top films.", "Like all Hitchcock films, Saboteur is excellently acted.", "...even the most avid Hitchcock fan will have a tough time embracing the film.", "", "A trial run for North by Northwest, though lacking the thematic resonances.", "Of course Saboteur is well directed, though it's rather like visiting an art museum's 'early works' exhibit of an artist before he became the Master of his form.", "This film, Hitchcock's first contribution to wartime American propaganda, is as polished and suspenseful as any the great director would make.", "", ""], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "B-", "", "2/4", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Elena de la Torre", "Bosley Crowther", "Josephine O&#39;Neill", "Jay Carmody", "Age Staff", "SMH Staff", "Dave Kehr", "David Parkinson", "TIME Staff", "Michael E.
