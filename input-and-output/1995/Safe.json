Screams out with existential terror showcasing how the lack of identity is not only anxiety-inducing but potentially inevitable due to the modern world we live in.", "In many ways, 'Safe' predicts both the insular nature of contemporary society, and the (counter-intuitive) disease of conformity that's synonymous with it.", "For all its disquiet, Safe is truly about the terror of losing control-or, even more frightening, being made aware of the fact that we never had control to begin with.", "Safe is brilliant for the way Haynes, with cinematographer Alex Nepomniaschy and composer Ed Tomney, blankets the mundane in the eerie tone of science fiction and horror.", "Moore, evidently under Haynes' instruction, gives a performance composed of near-total inertia. Her pale lifelessness -- meant to be frightening, I suppose -- is merely irritating.", "With anti-star boldness, Moore doesn't so much embody the role as disembody it, dissolving before our eyes.", "Moore, in a nearly unplayable role, is amazingly vivid and touching; this is a heartbreaking portrait of a woman in full, panicked retreat from life.", "Frequently fascinating, it never builds into anything profound.", "Safe is numbingly fascinating, partly due to its carefully composed, antiseptic visual style and its throbbingly threatening soundtrack.", "You'd have to be cranky or blind to deny Haynes' artistry and vision. There's a dark power, a tremor that runs through the movie like the rumble of a secret dread.", "Todd Haynes has always tended towards the clinical, an approach which in this dark and ambiguous allegory proves ever so coolly appropriate.", "Beautifully constructed, chilling internal nightmare where every scene plays out like a little mini movie in and of itself. Brilliant.", "This creepy art movie will stay with you.", "In a summer of heavyweight action movies and flyweight romantic comedies, I don't think you'll find a more provocative little number than Safe, which creeps under your skin like a rash.", "The audaciousness that marked Todd Haynes' earlier work has been supplanted by self-important preachiness.", "Like Carol, this gifted filmmaker seems to be trapped inside a shell -- devoting his considerable intelligence mainly to justifying his own sense of paralysis."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "", "A", "", "", "", "4/4", "5/5", "2/4", "5/5", "", "2/4", "", "3/4", "", "4/5", "", "B+", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "K.
