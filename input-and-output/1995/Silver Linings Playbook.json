{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After losing his job and wife, and spending time in a mental institution, Pat Solatano (Bradley Cooper) winds up living with his parents (Robert De Niro, Jacki Weaver). He wants to rebuild his life and reunite with his wife, but his parents would be happy if he just shared their obsession with the Philadelphia Eagles. Things get complicated when Pat meets Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), who offers to help him reconnect with his wife, if he will do something very important for her in exchange.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "2h 2m", "director": "David O.

[Full review in Spanish]", "David O. Russell's eccentric Philly-cheesesteak screwball comedy leaves me cold, but may prove to be his big crossover hit.", "You have crazy, raised by crazy, befriended by crazy, thinking crazy, advised by crazy, dreaming crazy, and in love with crazy all happening in a crazy city of of crazy sports fans.", "Russell has adapted the script to highlight the difficulties of the characters - whether it is mental illness, friendship problems or just plain closure - to a bittersweet effect.", "In Silver Linings Playbook, David O. Russell sets his dysfunctional love story against a working class neighborhood in Philadelphia and he totally nails it.", "This is a movie worth any movie lover's time and money.", "Although Silver Linings Playbook is high-concept fare, it doesn't feel formulaic. The story unfolds with such loopy, oddball energy that you almost forget it's a romantic comedy.", "Fans of Russell's earlier films might lament his new career path as him selling out, but doing so doesn't give him enough credit. His work is still subversive, but now it's getting him better results.", "A perfect storm of great writing and expert performances working in tandem, a rare romantic comedy with both a heart and a brain that rings painfully and beautifully true.", "It's charming and challenging, even as it starts to conform to the romantic comedy playbook.", "Despite its flaws, it's got romance AND sports AND funny family drama AND a really hilariously amazing can't stop laughing about it dance scene.", "Though Silver Linings deserves credit for its portrayal of the middle ground of mental illness, it's as much of a mess as its characters, veering between tone-deafness and deep sympathy, convincing portrayal and cheap clich\u00e9.", "Lawrence, so good in Winter's Bone, comes as a revelation.", "One of the most charming Hollywood screwball comedies of recent years.", "In any event, this is a refreshing and extremely well-acted film.", "The movie is a mess, but a glorious, big-hearted, beautifully acted one.", "Despite the film's flaws, Russell excels at creating a community of misfits around Pat and Tiffany."], "rating": ["", "7/10", "4.0/4", "7/10", "", "5/5", "3.5/5", "4.5/5", "", "", "7.4/10", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "4/5", "7/10", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Katie Presley", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Yasser Medina", "David Lamble", "Don Shanahan", "Katie Smith-Wong", "David Harris", "Leslie Combemale", "Brian D.
