{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When government scientist Xavier Fitch (Ben Kingsley) intercepts a space transmission containing the genetic sequence for an alien life form, he uses it to produce \"Sil\" (Natasha Henstridge) -- a gorgeous alien-human hybrid.

The U.S. government dispatches top assassin Preston Lennox (Michael Madsen) and a team of experts to stop her.", "rating": "43", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Roger Donaldson", "studio": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 17, 2017", "box_office": "$58.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The best that can be said about 'Species' is that the soundtrack composed by Christopher Young is OK. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Standard special effects these days, but what lifts Species above the average is the bunch of boffins trying to track down Sil in LA (great camouflage for a weirdo) before she reproduces.", "There's basic pleasure to be had from the gruesome, orgasmic demises of its gaggle of mid-price character players.", "As a straight fright film, Species would be wildly laughable for all the wrong reasons. But for moviegoers able to shelve credibility and go with the gory flow, it is a nifty parody of 1950s science-fiction fare.", "It's lip-smackingly good, gory horror fare, with a whole series of thrilling sequences topped off by a cliffhanging climax.", "It would be comforting to think that the genus Cinema Americana were guided by the principal of natural selection, but cloning and reversion seem, rather, to be the norm.", "I must admit I really enjoyed Species. I like being manipulated by a clever director, even though it isn't the best of its genre.", "It's a lot of fun. It's certainly well directed. We've seen it all before, but I enjoyed it.", "It's a sex horror-fantasy without laughs or life, a nightmare without sense, a casual pickup that should have been left at the disco.", "Despite its silly excesses of misogyny -- watch out for female sexuality, it'll kill ya! -- this absurdly exploitative sci-fi movie is not unpleasant to watch.", "As cheesy exploitation, Species offers a few cheap thrills for the teen-age boys who are too young to see it but will get in anyway. For the rest of us, its untidy mixture of misogyny and gore seems to represent the DNA of sleaze.", "Alien meets Basic Instinct in this textbook illustration of what happens when millions of dollars' worth of technical expertise is brought to bear on a cheap, exploitative script.", "In spite of all its unexplained and semiridiculous plot premises it works surprisingly well as a genre exercise, perhaps because, like Alien, it knows how to exploit misogynist biological and sexual anxieties for all they're worth.", "Species begins stunningly. Soon, however, as a murderous outsider disguised as a supermodel madly tries to breed, Feldman's screenplay betrays its ingenious concept.", "Despite the ridiculous premise and casting this is still a pacey little sci-thriller.", "It's all competent enough, and the climactic scenes play out in a pretty exciting way, but don't expect anything innovative here.", "Director Roger Donaldson and screenwriter Dennis Feldman show an unexpected flair for the exploitation form.", "Roger Donaldson directs Species with a firm pace, and right up until the end he's in control of a most satisfying summer film.", "Imaginatively cast and tautly directed, although the script is frequently more perfunctory (to say nothing of ludicrous) than inspired. Still, the film is better than its mangy reputation.", "A cheesy rip off science fiction/horror hybrid."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "3.5/5", "3.5/5", "2/4", "2/4", "2/4", "2.5/5", "", "", "3/5", "2/4", "4/5", "3/4", "2.5/4", "C+"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Quentin Curtis", "Film4 Staff", "Roger Hurlburt", "Sky Staff", "Sheila Johnston", "Margaret Pomeranz", "David Stratton", "Michael Phillips", "Jami Bernard", "Stephen Hunter", "TV Guide Staff", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Malcolm Johnson", "Ian Nathan", "John Wooley", "Jay Boyar", "Gene Siskel", "Matt Brunson", "Dennis Schwartz"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent on Sunday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sky Cinema", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">At the Movies (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">At the Movies (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews"], "date": ["August 23, 2019", "December 3, 2018", "December 3, 2018", "December 3, 2018", "December 3, 2018", "December 3, 2018", "December 3, 2018", "December 3, 2018", "December 3, 2018", "December 3, 2018", "December 3, 2018", "December 3, 2018", "December 3, 2018", "December 3, 2018", "December 3, 2018", "December 3, 2018", "December 3, 2018", "December 3, 2018", "July 17, 2017", "March 8, 2016"]}}
