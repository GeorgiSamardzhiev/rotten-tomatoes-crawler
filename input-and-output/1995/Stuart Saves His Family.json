In a subgenre littered with films worth forgetting, here is one that's good enough and smart enough.", "", "It isn't good enough, it isn't smart enough, and, doggone it, most people won't like Stuart Saves His Family.", "Often funny, darker than you'd expect, and firmly grounded in Franken's extensive experience of the 12-Step worldview.", "Even if you find Franken hard to bear, as I do, the movie's take on how he functions in the world is both authoritative and compelling, and the movie steadily grows in stature.", "Played unsuccessfully for laughs, it is ploddingly directed. And proudly proclaimed as a Ramis film. After this he should change his name or profession.", "Those familiar with Alcoholics Anonymous' 12-step recovery programme may bond in sympathy. The sentimentality, however, doesn't play.", "I prepared myself for yet another \"one joke\" Saturday Night Live movie here, but what I got was an enjoyable little film that actually touched upon some interesting issues...", "", "", "Not as bad as you'd expect", "I forgive you, Al Franken. You were young and needed the money.", "", "", "The plotting is surprisingly banal, involving even talk of a property easement and turning Stuart into the executor of a relative's estate. And the relatives' problems are taken semi-seriously, which is more than this lightweight film can handle.", "There can be no excuse.", "Though it misfires, this spoof of recovery programs should be noted for its sincerity.", "Better than most SNL flotsam, but surely that's not saying much.", "It was much funnier when we didn't see Stuart's family.
