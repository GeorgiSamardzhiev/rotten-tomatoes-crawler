{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Unscrupulous movie producer Jonathan Shields (Kirk Douglas) is a child of Hollywood who ruthlessly toils his way to the top of the studio system, discarding movie star Georgia (Lana Turner), director Fred Amiel (Barry Sullivan) and writer James Lee Bartlow (Dick Powell) along the way. Although Shields manipulates them and leaves each in despair, they find success in Hollywood, thanks in part to Shields, and must decide whether or not to repay him when he offers them a collaborative project.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 58m", "director": "Vincente Minnelli", "studio": "MetroGoldwynMayer,Loew&#39;sInc.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Bad proves Minnelli to be one of the most assured and powerful names in the world of cinematic melodrama, and his ability to bring to the genre the sense of tension found more often in noir pictures, really makes this film a singular and esoteric entrant.", "The Bad and the Beautiful is a lot of film, and seems always on the verge of getting somewhere. But it never does.", "Brilliant as the film undoubtedly is, ingeniously shaped and textured, it remains, with its lack of a developing centre, too insubstantial.", "MGM gathered together a galaxy of stars... and to my mind attempted to make another All About Eve. Instead, they just made another film with one of the most incoherent stories I've ever tried to decipher.", "Instead of satire there is false sentiment.", "Though some of the characters may be bad and others beautiful, few are either real or believable.", "As a study of Hollywood the film is not particularly observant. It has gumption but no imagination. It draws attention to false values but does not put them in their place.", "If this is Hollywood with the lid off, the smell is not pleasant, but it is certainly powerful, and i strongly urge you to take a sniff.", "Although a good deal less penetrating in its close-up of \"the real Hollywood\" than it pretends to be, this is a smooth and enjoyable comedy-drama.", "The film gets full marks for dialogue and full marks for direction by Vincente Minnelli.", "Thanks to the masterful direction, the fine screenplay, the exceptionally good dialogue and the excellent performances of everyone in the star-studded cast, The Bad and the Beautiful emerges as a first-rate adult drama.", "Douglas' teeth-clenched, dimple-thrusting megalomaniac is among his best work, while the gossipy screenplay (another Oscar winner) is served wonderfully by Minnelli's lush melodramatics.", "Minnelli's love/hate letter to Hollywood is still essential viewing for any seasoned film buff.", "Along the way there are pleasures aplenty, among them several delightful performances on the supporting card.", "The movie doesn't really know what to do with the unruly implications it has manufactured.", "The third act drags, making the film feel overlong and sluggish.", "Working from a poison-pen script by Charles Schnee, director Vincente Minnelli uncovers the darkness behind every deal and the provocation behind every production, playing into the narrative of Tinseltown as a place where souls are sold rather than saved.", "...swoons for all things silver screen.", "The master class in piquant flash tends to Hollywood's warts like sumptuous flowers", "Charles Schnee's whip-smart script, packed with sharp one-liners and passionate dialogue is a pitch-perfect accompaniment to the noir-ish look of Robert Surtees's cinematography."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "5/5", "", "4/10", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Joshua Brunsting", "Jane Corby", "James Morgan", "Courier Mail Staff", "Times (UK) Staff", "TIME Staff", "Bruce Grant", "Virginia Graham", "Clyde Gilmour", "Robin Slessor", "P.S.
