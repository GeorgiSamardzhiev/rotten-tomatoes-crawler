{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A Spanish writer who pens romance novels as Amanda Gris, Leo Macias (Marisa Paredes) is successful, but unlucky in her own love life. With her solider husband, Paco (Imanol Arias), increasingly distant, both literally and figuratively, Leo tries to fill the void in her life by reevaluating her writing, which leads to an unexpected relationship with Angel (Juan Echanove), a sensitive newspaper editor. Helmed by renowned filmmaker Pedro Almodovar, the movie features a mix of comedy and melodrama.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Pedro Almod\u00f3var", "studio": "ElDeseoS.A.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 18, 2017", "box_office": "$938.7K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There is not much of a plot; just real, romantically entwined lives -- a world away from the gaudy camp Almodovar had begun to tire us with.", "If it isn't as successful as his very best work, neither is it a failure -- and there are certainly enough Alomodovarisms to bring a smile to anyone's face", "", "Dramatizes the contentious relationship between fiction and reality.", "an archetypal romantic comedy that reshapes the mold", "I found this dramatization a mature Almodovar work, perceptive and cutting through in an incisive way to the everyday problems in life that wear people down.", "Though The Flower of My Secret is a slight work, it is a pleasing return to form.", "", "The movie is full of familiar Almodovar fare, but it feels freshened.", "Depicts the magical turnaround in the life of a writer of romance novels.", "Seems to go in a dozen directions at once but ties up in the final reel into a tight, cohesive and enjoyable whole.", "An intimate, beautifully wrought work, it reflects a new maturity in Almodovar's work and is one of his best pictures.", "For the most part it is an absorbing story.", "If Leo appears to be doing some more or less orthodox movie-style suffering -- crying jags, a suicide attempt and the like -- perhaps that's just what she's supposed to be doing.", "Though Almodovar touches on many of his favorite absurdities, he does so with surprising subtlety.", "The film is attentive as well to the clichs that constitute reality and cinematic realism.
