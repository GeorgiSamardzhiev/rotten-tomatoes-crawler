{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this film based on a true story, Bill Miner (Richard Farnsworth) is a fearless stagecoach robber in the days of the Wild West. After he is arrested and jailed for more than 30 years, he re-emerges into a bustling new world. But Miner cannot give up his old ways. Soon he pulls off a successful railway heist and goes on the lam in British Columbia, where he falls for bold photographer Katherine Flynn (Jackie Burroughs). But Miner was not built for settling down.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Western", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Phillip Borsos", "studio": "MercuryProductions", "theater_date": "Mar 18, 1983", "dvd_date": "Aug 30, 2020", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The Grey Fox is sizzling with an indistinct charm in that it's a film that exists on its own terms.", "It's an adventure as bountiful as any, set in a world where appreciation and innovation left the Wild West behind, but allowed its sentiments to linger a little while longer.", "Beyond its other pleasures, it's also a testament to the talent of first-time feature director Philip Borsos...", "The filmmaking is \"respectable\" almost to a fault. But then the grainy solidity of an image catches and holds us, or Richard Farnsworth says something, it doesn't matter what, and we can't imagine he could be anything less than honest.", "A Western classic.", "The Grey Fox serves as an ideal legacy to these two prodigious talents and also happens to still be a stupendously entertaining film in its own right as well.", "Director Phillip Borsos has a fascinating, true story to tell and a creative way to present it.", "While not a deconstruction of the western, there is something to be said about this 1982 film working as one that inserts an outlaw into a new world that has outgrown him.", "As drama, the story is genteel to a fault, with nothing provocative or troubling to disturb our enjoyment of the scenery. This limits the achievement. And yet it casts a spell.", "a painterly marvel, the kind of film that presents visual poetry in a way that feels utterly natural, rather than compulsorily \"artistic\"", "The dialogue ranges from drolly blunt (\"I robbed stagecoaches\" is as succinct yet encompassing a line as, \"We rob banks\") to painterly and colorful (\"I'm just not cut out for work that's planned by other hands\").", "One of the best Canadian westerns? There's not much else to say aboot it.", "Lyrical and almost rapturous. Farnsworth is extraordinary.", "A \"you can't make this up\" crime drama powered by Richard Farnsworth's iconic performance as an aging gentleman bandit.", "Grand in scope and intimate in feel, so beautifully shot and edited as to make you miss celluloid.", "The Grey Fox isn't a precise record of history - for one thing, Miner's story in the film ends on a different note than it did in real life. But it's a beautiful piece of Canadiana...", "One of the best films of the 1980s and one of the greatest films to come out of Canada.", "", "", "Here's one of the loveliest adventures of the year, a movie about a stubborn, indomitable character who robs people because that's what he knows best."], "rating": ["", "4/4", "", "3/5", "A", "", "", "8/10", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "", "9/10", "", "3.5/4", "3/4", "4/5", "5/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Alexander Miller", "Luke Parker", "Dennis Harvey", "Rob Gonsalves", "Dennis Schwartz", "Peter Sobczynski", "Diane Carson", "Aaron Neuwirth", "Michael Phillips", "James Kendrick", "David Bax", "Alex Saveliev", "Peter Rainer", "Peter Canavese", "Roger Moore", "Chris Knight", "Phil Hall", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "Emanuel Levy", "Roger Ebert"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Inquiry", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dr. Filmlove&#39;s Film Reviews and Ratings", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">48 Hills", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KDHX (St. Louis)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">We Live Entertainment", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Q Network Film Desk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Battleship Pretension", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">FilmWeek (KPCC - NPR Los Angeles)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Celluloid Dreams", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Nation", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">National Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fantastica Daily", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Sun-Times"], "date": ["June 23, 2020", "June 18, 2020", "June 12, 2020", "June 10, 2020", "June 6, 2020", "June 4, 2020", "June 4, 2020", "June 4, 2020", "June 3, 2020", "June 3, 2020", "May 31, 2020", "May 30, 2020", "May 29, 2020", "May 28, 2020", "May 15, 2020", "April 28, 2020", "September 14, 2012", "October 9, 2005", "July 1, 2005", "October 23, 2004"]}}
