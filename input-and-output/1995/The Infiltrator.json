{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1986, federal agent Robert Mazur (Bryan Cranston) goes under cover to infiltrate the trafficking network of Colombian drug kingpin Pablo Escobar. Working with fellow agents Kathy Ertz (Diane Kruger) and Emir Abreu (John Alberto Leguizamo), Mazur poses as a slick, money-laundering businessman named Bob Musella. Gaining the confidence of Roberto Alcaino (Benjamin Bratt), Escobar's top lieutenant, Mazur must navigate a vicious criminal underworld where one wrong move could cost him everything.", "rating": "72", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 7m", "director": "Brad Furman", "studio": "GoodFilms", "theater_date": "Jul 13, 2016", "dvd_date": "Oct 11, 2016", "box_office": "$15.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["[Brad] Furman have done a great job putting together a film of this true and complicated story about a man who put himself in extremely dangerous situations.", "Well told, nicely paced, and beautifully acted, The Infiltrator, left me craving more at the end.", "Outside of the dense character work and exemplary performances from even the bit players, The Infiltrator is lackluster in every other stylistic aspect.", "Unrelentingly tense, it lets the audience blow off steam with well-timed humour. It certainly gets the heart pumping, but there's nothing much for the brain to do after you've left the cinema.", "A crime thriller that has plenty of familiar elements in play but also has an ace-in-the-hole in the form of a dynamic lead performance from Bryan Cranston.", "Picture this as a \"Goodfellas\" with Bryan Cranston.", "[Cranston is] a joy to watch as he glides from Colombia to Miami to London, swirling whiskey in a crystal glass while flying on a private jet or smashing cake into the face of a waiter for bringing his wife the wrong order.", "\"The Infiltrator\" is a semi-entertaining drug cartel film that allows for a two hour escape into its world of violence and high-stakes suspense.", "I generally despise films that end in a wedding -- too lazy a finish for dippy rom coms. But this wedding's pathos and suspense are unlike anything we've seen since The Godfather. The Infiltrator is a cinematic offer you can't refuse.", "Bryan Cranston just has 'it'. This now iconic character actor commands attention.", "The Infiltrator introduces a dizzying ensemble of characters into its overstretched duration to weave a tale we already know too well.", "The daring Brad Furman is still looking for his style among Heisenberg and Narcos. [Full review in Spanish]", "Although the ensemble and energy of The Infiltrator are good, the film as a whole comes up a little short.", "The film begins in 1986 and is based on a true story, and you have to wish that it had either been told earlier or, if it is to be told now, told with a lot more style.", "The Infiltrator is entertaining enough, and makes for solid summer counter-programming.", "This is an Oscar worthy performance beautifully supported by numerous good actors; for example, he's joined by John Leguizamo as the explosive and unpredictable Emir.", "The Infiltrator is what I like to call a decent Saturday laundry film, something that you can put on, walk away from it and let it run on it's own for about 10 minutes, return to it and not be lost at all.", "The Infiltrator just manages to stand out amongst modern films. Bolstered by a strong cast and an engaging, based on true events story, it is a surprisingly enjoyable experience.", "Cranston shines in a fact-based yarn that treads well-worn ground with enough panache to excuse the dj vu.", "[Bryan Cranston is] the most watchable, dangerous, frangible thing in The Infiltrator, a B-standard crime thriller based on the exploits of undercover \"narc\" Robert Mazur."], "rating": ["", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "B", "3.5/5", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "3/5", "3.5/5", "2/5", "", "", "C+", "", "4/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Linda and Al Lerner", "Allison Rose", "Dominic Griffin", "Marcus Beard", "Micheal Compton", "Rendy Jones", "Glynis Costin", "Mae Abdulbaki", "Lisa Johnson Mandell", "Leah Sydney", "Anton Bitel", "Carlos Mara\u00f1\u00f3n", "Courtney Howard", "Matthew Bond", "Sarah Marrs", "Diane Carson", "Candice Frederick", "David Fontana", "Neil Smith", "Nigel Andrews"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies and Shakers", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">FlickDirect", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rendy Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">InStyle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies with Mae", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AtHomeInHollywood.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Showbiz 411", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Projected Figures", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cineman\u00eda (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fresh Fiction", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Mail on Sunday (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lainey Gossip", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KDHX (St. Louis)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Talk Online", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Inquiry", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Financial Times"], "date": ["October 22, 2019", "October 2, 2019", "July 17, 2019", "March 13, 2019", "January 15, 2019", "August 30, 2018", "August 26, 2018", "August 22, 2018", "August 22, 2018", "June 22, 2018", "April 12, 2018", "March 30, 2018", "November 5, 2017", "October 18, 2017", "October 16, 2017", "August 29, 2017", "March 21, 2017", "February 22, 2017", "December 28, 2016", "December 28, 2016"]}}
