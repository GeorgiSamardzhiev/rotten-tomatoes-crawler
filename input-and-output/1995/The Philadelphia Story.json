[Full review in Spanish]", "With such a cast and with the sharp cleverness that is the guideline of the film, it's not surprising to say that few times we have had so much fun in the cinema. [Full review in Spanish]", "One of cinema's most dazzling comedies, a whirlwind of breathless wordplay and effortlessly beguiling performances.", "Miss Hepburn, as a comedienne, is perhaps a greater star than she ever was at any prior cinema period, as a serious actress. This comes near being her champion achievement.", "For a comedy of manners, The Philadelphia Story is awfully screwball.", "An effervescent social satire that pokes fun at all sides in the class war. It's wickedly witty, gloriously romantic, whip-smart and complex, even verging on the unsavoury at times -- all in all, something of a complete entertainment.", "This frothy theatre adaptation dates from the period when Hollywood had pretty much perfected the art of the romantic comedy.", "This is close to perfection with Katharine Hepburn repeating her stage triumph as spoilt socialite Tracy Lord.", "Still a sparkling delight.", "Utterly beguiling, funny and romantic ...", "Cukor's direction flawlessly picks up on defining character traits, and all the intricate detail makes watching this movie feel like you're an invisible gatecrasher at the Lords' party.", "Just sit back and enjoy romantic comedy at its most sublime.", "The film is a Hepburn triumph, and moviegoers who resent the theatre's habit of requisitioning their stars may feel that Miss Hepburn's time on the stage has not been spent in vain and that she simply prepared herself for this achievement.", "Spoofs and plays sly homage to Clifford Odets' earnest socialist dramas", "How well all is pulled together and comes off, is more glaring when 'The Philadelphia Story' is compared to its fluffy but fangless 1956 musical adaptation, 'High Society.'", "Screwball romance is lots of fun for older kids.", "Romantic comedies are rarely this fabulous."], "rating": ["5/5", "1", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "9/10", "5/5", "4/5", "5/5", "4/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "", "8", "", "5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Danielle Solzman", "Mike Massie", "John Kinloch", "Francisco J.
