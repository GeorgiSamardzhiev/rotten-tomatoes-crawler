{"metadata": {"synopsis": "It's New Year's Eve in Tehran, Iran, where it's a tradition to buy or catch a fish. Seven-year-old Razieh (Aida Mohammadkhani) yearns for a new goldfish for her family's pond, but in 90 minutes all the shops will close for a week-long holiday. After she and her brother, Ali (Mohsen Kalifi), convince their mother (Fereshteh Sadr Orfani) to give them the family's last 500 tomans, they must make it to the market in time, ward off shady characters looking to prey on them and hang on to the money.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 25m", "director": "Jafar Panahi", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The documentary-style realism of Panahi's cinematography adds rhythm to a prosaic city's mundanity, where even a debut film seems like the work of a veteran.", "", "", "", "", "In an era when ethnic hatred turns groups against each other, it is salutary to come across a film about universal qualities linking people from different cultures.", "By putting itself in sync with the rhythms of everyday life, it offers a reminder that the simplest forms of filmmaking can be the most satisfying.", "Without it ever being said, we get to meet and deeply appreciate some of the Iranian people who never make the news.", "The brilliance of the film, is in its simplicity.", "Panahi has much the same kind of talent, a concern to make his film a kind of home for its characters, but he has not yet found [Kiarostami's] secret, how to find and hold the still point of the turning world.", "Raziah takes everything at face value, forcing us to look again at people and situations we would immediately judge as good or bad -- reason enough to see this film.", "There are LONG stretches of... well, real time.", "[Mohammadkhani] has no screen presence and more over was about as much fun to listen to as someone scraping their fingers down a blackboard.", "Explores childhood on its own terms, with great respect and an unerring sense of truth.", "Often this movie just feels like a walk in the park with a recalcitrant child.
