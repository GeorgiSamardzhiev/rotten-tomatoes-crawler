{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this gritty Western classic, aging outlaw Pike Bishop (William Holden) prepares to retire after one final robbery. Joined by his gang, which includes Dutch Engstrom (Ernest Borgnine) and brothers Lyle (Warren Oates) and Tector Gorch (Ben Johnson), Bishop discovers the heist is a setup orchestrated in part by his old partner, Deke Thornton (Robert Ryan). As the remaining gang takes refuge in Mexican territory, Thornton trails them, resulting in fierce gunfights with plenty of casualties.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Western", "runtime": "2h 22m", "director": "Sam Peckinpah", "studio": "WarnerBrothers", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This controversial epic was as highly praised as it was condemned upon its release, boomingly announcing the arrival of daring new director.", "It is one of the greatest of all westerns.", "It has canonized, for our enjoyment and monstrous edification, the freak-out.", "The result is one of the strongest emotional kickbacks of any film. The Wild Bunch does for the emotions what Shane did for the intellect.", "The film drives to its foregone conclusion with the sureness of an arrow.", "If you must see The Wild Bunch, be sure to take along a barf bag.", "The Wild Bunch is the last and indisputable epic story of the Western genre. [Full Review in Spanish]", "There is an unpleasant feeling of expense, of enormous amounts of money being spent, tons of footage being shot in order to get one slow-motion instant that will stamp home Peckinpah's obsessive theme", "My favorite western because of the staunch code of loyalty and ethics employed by men outside the law, and for the amazing mingling of eras - the Mexican civil war, Germans and early airplanes are all factors in small but haunting ways.", "Peckinpah's work, immaculately framed and searingly edited, leads us to wonder whether film form is hopelessly, and inevitably, in thrall to brutality.", "Remains hugely impressive, both for its technical brilliance and the emotional ferocity of its themes: old age, friendship, betrayal and the struggle to retain some kind of cock-eyed code of honour in an increasingly cynical world.", "Peckinpah plaits simple strands into an intricate pattern of contradictions and moral ambiguities.", "Underneath the movie, which is set on the eve of World War I, there's an elegiac plangency that stays with you long after the shocks have worn off...The Wild Bunch still won't go down easy.", "Extremely violent '60s Western with drinking and sex.", "It's a traumatic poem of violence, with imagery as ambivalent as Goya's.", "Even as a spectacular victim of its own success, the film retains a primitive, raw, vulgarly masculine power that leaves it powerful in all the right ways, and surprisingly un-dated.", "In Peckinpah's world, the law and the lawless are one and the same - destructive agents of chaos.", "It's the melancholy, the desolation. It's one of the saddest Westerns ever made.", "Arguably the strongest Hollywood movie of the 1960s -- a western that galvanizes the clich\u00e9s of its dying genre with a shocking jolt of delirious carnage.", "In an era when body-count films mirror the mounting body count offscreen, The Wild Bunch dissects death rather than glorifying it."], "rating": ["1", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "2/5", "", "1", "3.5/4", "5/5", "", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Allen Almachar", "Jean Carey Bond", "Paul Schrader", "Tom Milne", "Judith Crist", "Fernando Trueba", "Manny Farber", "Tom Meek", "Quentin Curtis", "Sheila Johnston", "Penelope Houston", "David Ansen", "Barbara Shulgasser", "Pauline Kael", "Tim Brayton", "Josh Larsen", "", "J.
