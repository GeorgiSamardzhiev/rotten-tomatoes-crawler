{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Heroin addict Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) stumbles through bad ideas and sobriety attempts with his unreliable friends -- Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), Begbie (Robert Carlyle), Spud (Ewen Bremner) and Tommy (Kevin McKidd). He also has an underage girlfriend, Diane (Kelly Macdonald), along for the ride. After cleaning up and moving from Edinburgh to London, Mark finds he can't escape the life he left behind when Begbie shows up at his front door on the lam, and a scheming Sick Boy follows.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 34m", "director": "Danny Boyle", "studio": "FigmentFilms,NoelGayMotionPictureCompany,PolyGramFilmedEntertainment", "theater_date": "Jul 19, 1996", "dvd_date": "Dec 19, 2015", "box_office": "$16.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Trainspotting gives insight into the rationale of an addict and even sympathizes with them in some ways. But viewers are also sucked in to the terrifying and surreal lows of withdrawal, as well as the real life consequences of addiction.", "As in his first film, Shallow Grave, Boyle's up-your-nose style of filmmaking is a ghoulish hoot.", "Like a 20th-century magical realist version of Dante Alighieri's Divine Comedy narrated by a lad from Edinburgh hooked on skag.", "Like the work of some sort of maverick theatre troupe, it's all carried off with a real concentric, anarchic verve.", "Trainspotting is a remarkable film.", "What's interesting, viewing the film now, is how it manages to be both inarguably of its time, the mid 90s, but also has not dated nearly as badly as most youth culture movies tend to.", "Trainspotting is supercharged with sulphurous humour and brutal recklessness: it charges at you like Ewan McGregor's Renton sprinting from store detectives in the opening sequence.", "A showy balancing act.", "Trainspotting is a look to a better world while you're down and stuck in the mud. [Full review in Spanish]", "A cult film because of it's particular way to deal with dark themes in a different way. [Full review in Spanish]", "By turns cheeky, surreal, exhilarating and stomach-churning.", "Brazen, hilarious, disgusting, audacious, altogether fresh.", "An unprecedented and unrivalled piece of entertainment.", "Funny, disturbing, tragic and deeply addictive.", "A grimy bolt of celluloid lightning unspooling at 24 crackling frames a second, this episodic tale of smart-aleck Scottish lads on heroin is the year's most exciting film -- and surely its most controversial.", "Trainspotting's saving grace is that there's a heck of a lot of entertainment value in this particular form of shallowness.", "All this doped-up ennui eventually proves wearing. Junkies, given to nodding out and living in squalor, don't make good company for too long.", "Heroin, as it turns out, provides the characters in Trainspotting with something the filmmakers can't -- motivation. Without the drug, Boyle can't convincingly explain the actions of Renton and his friends.", "Trainspotting, buoyed by a great Brit Pop soundtrack and Brian Tufano's agile cinematography, captures the stoned-out, gut-churning experience of hardcore addiction with hallucinogenic acuity.", "Unapologetic and hard-hitting, Irvine Welsh's controversial bestseller is brought to the screen as a dazzling assault on the senses."], "rating": ["", "", "", "4/5", "5/5", "4/5", "5/5", "9/10", "", "", "3.5/4", "3/4", "5/5", "", "", "4/5", "", "2.5/4", "3.5/4", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Ed Travis", "Michael Atkinson", "C.H.
