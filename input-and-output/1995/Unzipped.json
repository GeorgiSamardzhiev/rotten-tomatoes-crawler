{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This behind-the-scenes documentary takes a lighthearted look at the fashion industry through the launch of New York City designer Isaac Mizrahi's 1994 fall collection. The film explores the inspirations Mizrahi drew from to create the line -- which include Eskimos and \"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\" -- while revealing the harried reality of mounting a major fashion show. Along the way, a number of bold-faced fashion icons and actors crop up, including John Galliano to Richard Gere.", "rating": "80", "genre": "Documentary/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 16m", "director": "Douglas Keeve", "studio": "Miramax", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 8, 2016", "box_office": "$1.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["What is interesting is that Unzipped displays the enchantment and prestige of the fashion world but simultaneously demystifies the artificial glam surrounding it.", "", "Mizrahi is such a flambouyant character that we are fascinated by him the whole time he is on camera.
