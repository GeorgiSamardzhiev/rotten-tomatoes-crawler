{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Vietnam War hero Kowalski (Barry Newman) has become a pill-addicted driver for hire. Transporting a car from Colorado to California, he enlivens the journey by making a wager with his drug dealer: If the trip takes under 15 hours, Kowalski's latest amphetamine purchase is free. But Kowalski's recklessness on the road results in a much-publicized police chase. Radio jock Super Soul (Cleavon Little) covers the pursuit and turns Kowalski, who refuses to pull over, into a martyr for freedom.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Allen Smithee", "studio": "CupidProductionsInc.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 6, 2007", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The film does whip up a genuine excitement and suspense.
