{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After the melting of the polar ice caps, most of the globe is underwater. Some humans have survived, and even fewer still, notably the Mariner (Kevin Costner), have adapted to the ocean by developing gills. A loner by nature, the Mariner reluctantly befriends Helen (Jeanne Tripplehorn) and her young companion, Enola (Tina Majorino), as they escape from a hostile artificial island. Soon the sinister Smokers are pursuing them in the belief that Enola holds the key to finding the mythical Dryland.", "rating": "46", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 16m", "director": "Kevin Reynolds", "studio": "UniversalPictures,DavisEntertainment,GordonCompany", "theater_date": "Jul 28, 1995", "dvd_date": "Jan 5, 2016", "box_office": "$88.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["My Kevin Costner gettin' all Mad Max on a turbo jet-ski beats your Eddie Murphy goin' through the motions.", "A very dignified production with some tremendously stimulating ideas that, yes, were not entirely well exposed in the movie that came to theaters two decades ago.

And the uninspired and often inane dialogue in Peter Rader and David Twohy's script doesn't help.", "Waterworld is a pretty damn good summer movie. There, I've said it...it's a breezy, clever entertainment with stirring effects.", "Waterworld is a mess masquerading as a movie.
