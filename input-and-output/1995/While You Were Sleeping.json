{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Lonely transit worker Lucy Eleanor Moderatz (Sandra Bullock) pulls her longtime crush, Peter (Peter Gallagher), from the path of an oncoming train. At the hospital, doctors report that he's in a coma, and a misplaced comment from Lucy causes Peter's family to assume that she is his fianc\u00e9e. When Lucy doesn't correct them, they take her into their home and confidence. Things get even more complicated when she finds herself falling for Peter's sheepish brother, Jack (Bill Pullman).", "rating": "80", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Jon Turteltaub", "studio": "CaravanPictures,HollywoodPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$81.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Like most American romantic comedies, this is all heart and no head, but it does have a habit of sneaking in some intriguing twists and turns when you least expect it.", "Bullock gives Lucy just the right amount of edge. Pullman's performance as Peter's down-to-earth younger brother is also a deft mix of moxie and frustration.", "I don't buy it, and it's the kind of plot that genuinely leaves me cold.", "The script is actually really solid and the performances are so likable.", "It's practically certain to lull moviegoers into a pleasant state of dreamy bliss.", "The heart of the film's charm is Sandra Bullock.", "[Bullock] knows one of the secrets of doing romantic comedy: treating the romance as a good joke.", "Compared to While You Were Sleeping, even the half-baked scenario of the Marisa Tomei-Robert Downey Jr. romance Only You looks witty and inventive.", "The movie seems better suited to a holiday release. While You Were Sleeping arrives at the peak of spring, the only season that can make Christmas seem like an unwelcome visitor.", "While You Were Sleeping may not be a film for the ages. It likely won't even rank among the presummer season's biggest hits. But it is worth noting, for it may mark the birth of a star.", "This setup is ludicrous, but actually it's the most credible thing in this whole sorry, dishonest film.", "It's Bullock's first shot at a role in which she plays second fiddle neither to males nor special effects. And she turns out to be every bit as delightful as anyone might have expected.", "It's a long and frustrating wait, but While You Were Sleeping delivers all you can ask of a romantic comedy: the deluxe payoff.", "A cute premise with engaging leads but little else to keep you awake.", "It plays like a movie dreamed up by people in a studio marketing department who'd decided to bare their souls.", "What the movie does offer is a delectable performance by Bullock, who is funny and vulnerable and almost makes you buy her character's diving into this charade.", "This smartly scripted Cinderella love story is crammed with charm and the expert direction of Jon Turteltaub hits all the right emotional buttons.", "This year's Sleepless In Seattle.
