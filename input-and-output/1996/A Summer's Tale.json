{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Before beginning a new job, Gaspard (Melvil Poupaud) goes to a beach town to relax for a few weeks. He waits for Lena (Aurelia Nolin), a girl he has been casually dating for some time. When she does not arrive, he strikes up a friendship with waitress Margot (Amanda Langlet). Through her, Gaspard also meets Solene (Gwena\u00eblle Simon), a free spirit open to a physical relationship if he agrees to be faithful. As Gaspard spends time with each, he finds his feelings even further conflicted.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "\u00c9ric Rohmer", "studio": "Paramount", "theater_date": "Jun 20, 2014", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$198.1K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["As far as human interaction via intelligent and compelling conversation goes, it's hard to best Rohmer, whose simple, sometimes banal situations reveal unpredictable depths.", "The sheer beat of the words keeps the actors moving in time, moving in circles, moving toward or away from each other...", "... suffice it to say that there is little or no reason to see this film.", "Eric Rohmer characters never get a vacation from their personality hang-ups. Strangely, they are still good company, thanks to the auteur's feather-light touch.", "A piercingly funny work of indecision.", "The film is a welcome tonic to the cinematic landfill that gets pushed into theatres this time of year.", "[Rohmer] gives us a concept of time passed, of meals eaten, of travel and weather. In other words, these characters are talking about their lives while they live them, trying to figure it all out as it happens.", "A Summer's Tale is one of those movies where it looks like nothing is happening ...", "Few directors could say as much with as little as Eric Rohmer.", "This one perfectly captures the promise of summer love, of flings that may not lead anywhere and probably weren't supposed to, practiced by young people who believe everything good lies ahead of them.", "There's a purity to the experience of watching a film so naturalistic, like living in someone else's life for two hours.", "It's one of Rohmer's finest, brimming with his usual mix of gorgeous locations and beautiful people caught up in romantic entanglements that challenge their misguided concepts of love.", "This is a movie of high innocence, set at a time in life when romantic love is still a frolic and the seaside is a balm that quells all ills.", "...an easygoing sort of film. Rohmer takes his time getting where he's going. His is a measured gait, however, not just narrative meandering.", "Astute, unhurried and gently amusing, it will be welcomed by the director's fans while serving as a fine introduction for those who know him not.", "The world turns, the sun rises and sets, and the ocean's waves splash on idyllic beaches in Eric Rohmer's \"A Summer's Tale.\"", "For all his seeming facility with the opposite sex, Gaspard is really a romantic idiot. And aren't we all, Rohmer suggests.", "The fresh-faced actors, realistic dialogue and naturalistic performances suggest a casual approach, but as the story progresses, the filmmaker's control is increasingly evident.", "If it lacks its predecessor's subtlety and depth, it compensates with its own abundance of more immediate pleasures.", "Wise, honest, breezy, witty and profound, A Summer's Tale is an intellectually and emotionally rewarding date movie for sophisticated couples."], "rating": ["4/5", "", "", "3.5/5", "A-", "4/5", "3.5/4", "3/4", "4/4", "4/4", "4/5", "A-", "B+", "3.5/5", "", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "", "9.5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "Charles Mudede", "Neely Swanson", "Joe Bendel", "Peter Labuza", "Josh Kupecki", "Jeffrey M.
