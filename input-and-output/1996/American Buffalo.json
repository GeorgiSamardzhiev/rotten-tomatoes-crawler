Unfortunately, it now sits in another store, and the men will have to stage a holdup in order to retrieve it. Don's loser pal, Teach (Dustin Hoffman), believes he can make the heist work and talks his way into joining the scheme, but Don starts to get nervous about the plan.", "rating": "74", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Michael Corrente", "studio": "PunchProductions,SamuelGoldwynCompany", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 14, 2017", "box_office": "$632.1K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Mamet's strafing dialogue still hits its marks, but director Michael Corrente never manages to turn this into anything more than a static filmed play.", "", "Dustin Hoffman channels his Ratso Rizzo character from the 1969 Midnight Cowboy.", "Mesmerized by the trademark Mamet gutter poetry, Corrente directs unobtrusively and respectfully.", "In this overly theatrical version, Hoffman gives a mediocre performance in a role that Al Pacino excelled with on stage.
