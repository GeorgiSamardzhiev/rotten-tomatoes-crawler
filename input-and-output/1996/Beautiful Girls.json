It may not tell us anything new, but its eloquence is quietly rewarding.", "Natalie Portman steals all the scenes with Timothy Hutton and lights up the movie...", "This startlingly uneventful compendium of thick-headed boy-talk and female tolerance squanders a fine cast on incredibly ordinary characters and situations.", "Ted Demme's coming of age tale is about guys in their 20s who refuse or are unable to mature, which might explain why the most captivating relationship is between Timothy Hutton and the 13-year-old Natalie Portman.", "Women may be unimpressed, but men will squirm with recognition.", "", "", "", "", "A film about relationships and growing older that's funny and smart.", "", "", "", "Not a whole lot goes on, but what does go on is engaging enough to merit a look.", "", ""], "rating": ["4.5/5", "4/5", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "B", "", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "3/4", "3/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nick Rogers", "Darren Bignell", "Richard Schickel", "", "", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Todd McCarthy", "Emanuel Levy", "", "Kevin N.
