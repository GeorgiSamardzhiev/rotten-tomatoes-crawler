{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In Wes Anderson's first feature film, Anthony (Luke Wilson) has just been released from a mental hospital, only to find his wacky friend Dignan (Owen C. Wilson) determined to begin an outrageous crime spree. After recruiting their neighbor, Bob (Robert Musgrave), the team embarks on a road trip in search of Dignan's previous boss, Mr. Henry (James Caan). But the more they learn, the more they realize that they do not know the first thing about crime.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 31m", "director": "Wes Anderson", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 18, 2013", "box_office": "$488.6K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The performers look like they're having a lot of fun, but there is a great deal of skill on display.", "It's only in the finale of Bottle Rocket, brimming over with poignant male self-delusion, that the flair and sizzle of Anderson's future promise returns.", "A confident, eccentric debut about a trio of shambling and guileless friends who become the Candides of crime, Rocket feels particularly refreshing because it never compromises on its delicate deadpan sensibility.", "[Bottle Rocket] meanders pleasantly, like a road movie, with a seventies-style, anything-goes offhandedness that whisks the audience through the rough spots.", "Bottle Rocket was conceived as a low-budget family affair -- it has more Wilsons than the Beach Boys -- and outside of a few cult-intensive pockets of fandom, that's where it's likely to end up.", "This is a movie about friendship, about foolhardy endeavors that get your adrenaline going and make you feel life buzzing in your toes. Written with wit and concision and remarkable confidence, Bottle Rocket is a joyride worth taking.", "This deliciously offbeat comedy gets much of its oomph from a loopy screenplay and lead performances that can only be called hilariously bland, or is it blandly hilarious?", "Bottle Rocket is a beguiling surprise, a terrific little movie comedy about a slightly addled gang of young criminal wannabes.", "With a wild-card character like Dignan, he could be either the most original character in many a moon -- or never convincing. Wilson, with his cockeyed grin and rapid-fire delivery, comes off as a young Dennis Hopper.", "Wes Anderson's 1996 first feature (before Rushmore and The Royal Tenenbaums) is fresh, character driven, often funny, and unfashionably upbeat (as well as offbeat).", "Like the cheap pyrotechnic of the title, Bottle Rocket neither goes very far nor ends with a bang, and that's part of its charm, originality and delight.", "The title refers to cheap fireworks that fizz before they flame out quietly, and that's what three Southwestern slackers do in this amiable heist movie-cum-road flick.", "Even as you laugh at these guys, you feel an overwhelming sympathy for them. Sensing that they love each other, you want their dumb, dysfunctional lives to work out.", "Caan does a funny cameo as the local crimelord but the film belongs to Anderson's co-conspirator Wilson, whose wired performance leaps off the screen.", "Bottle Rocket may not be profound work, but it shows off some genuine talent both behind and in front of the camera.", "This is a small movie of raffish charm, similar in feel and tone to last year's independent hit The Brothers McMullen.", "Anderson's debut film is a small-scale delight.", "[An] agreeably eccentric comedy crime drama.", "A lot of the script has the ring of authenticity if only because all the private jokes and references that pass by are plainly embedded in the real lives of the creators.", "This is Anderson still finding his feet, but the steps and swagger are confident."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "1.5/4", "3.5/4", "3/4", "3/4", "3/4", "", "", "B+", "4/5", "", "3/4", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Hunter", "Brian Gibson", "Kenneth Turan", "Bruce Diones", "David Hinckley", "Steven Rea", "David Sterritt", "Michael Wilmington", "Doug Thomas", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Peter Keough", "Steve Daly", "Jay Boyar", "", "", "", "Jon Fortgang", "John Ferguson", "Kim Newman", "James White"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Alberta)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Phoenix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film"], "date": ["February 21, 2018", "July 2, 2014", "March 4, 2014", "March 4, 2014", "March 4, 2014", "March 4, 2014", "March 4, 2014", "March 4, 2014", "March 4, 2014", "March 4, 2014", "March 4, 2014", "March 4, 2014", "March 4, 2014", "March 4, 2014", "March 4, 2014", "March 4, 2014", "March 4, 2014", "March 4, 2014", "March 4, 2014", "March 4, 2014"]}}
