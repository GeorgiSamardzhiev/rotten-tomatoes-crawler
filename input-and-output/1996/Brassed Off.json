{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In a village in Northern England, Danny (Pete Postlethwaite), the conductor of a colliery brass band, has difficulty maintaining the morale of his musicians when the economic future of the area is threatened by the possibility that the local coal mine will be closed. When a former resident, Gloria (Tara Fitzgerald), returns to assess the mine, she get involved with her former flame, Andy (Ewan McGregor), and also the band, joining them in their last hurrah at a national competition.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Mark Herman", "studio": "Miramax", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 6, 2011", "box_office": "$2.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The movie delivers way too much doom-and-gloom-pah-pah.", "The edgy pace writer/director Mark Herman brings to the drama and his presentation of the musical sequences can't be faulted, and he draws remarkable performances from a cast that includes Ewan McGregor and Pete Postlethwaite.", "Pete Postlethwaite is moving as the bandleader, whose dream of taking his players to compete at the Albert Hall nearly eclipses his appreciation of the dire issues they face.", "[An] audacious, angry but oddly agreeable screed on the social evils of Thatcherism in 1992 Great Britain.", "The film is sentimental and its politics black-and-white. Still, \"Brassed Off\" is as rousing and immensely likable as a superb brass band, which the film is ostensibly about.", "\"Brassed Off\" is about as sloppy as it gets, but for nearly two-thirds of the movie the gushiness is pretty much kept in check. And those two thirds are quite a treat.", "It survives through its never-failing sense of humour and the fact that by its loving depiction of alternative values -- of warmth and community -- to the ones it assaults, you feel it has earned the right to turn attacker.", "", "Herman has come up with a neat idea in a setting he knows and understands, and the script, helped along by an excellent selection of Brit character actors, has a generally taught, well-worked-over feel.", "", "Writer/director Herman pulls off a popular, proletarian comedy which might actually appeal to the people it's about.", "", "An accessible, entertaining package that is at once formulaic and clich-busting.", "", "", "Touching story is a good early showcase for McGregor", "", "fun but overrated", "", "Brassed Off drives toward an ending that combines bitterness and high spirits, plus a heavy measure of romanticism.
