{"metadata": {"synopsis": "\"Citizen Ruth\" is the story of Ruth Stoops (Laura Dern), a woman who nobody even noticed -- until she got pregnant. Now, everyone wants a piece of her.

Dern is terrific.", "", "Payne didn't hit his stride until Election, but this is a good film.", "", "", "", "Payne's biting social satire about the abortion issue is shrewd and raucously entertaining.
