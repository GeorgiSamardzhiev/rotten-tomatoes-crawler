[Full Review in Spanish]", "A magical film, as brilliant and majestic as the city lights from which it gleans its title.", "Chaplin and his cast have crafted a silent film that is drastically funny, extremely well-shot and still holds up today...this is a labor of love, for sure, but the end result is a classic that has held the test of time.", "\"City Lights\" is excruciatingly funny and terribly, terribly sad. It makes you chuckle hysterically. You have the greatest time imaginable, and yet, occasionally you find little hurty lumps in your throat.", "City Lights is a paean to our best impulses, a plea for humanitarianism and justice.", "No filmmaker has ever been as successful as Chaplin in tugging at our heartstrings while simultaneously leaving us helpless in laughter, and this gem finds him operating at the peak of his abilities, even throwing his usual social critique into the mix.", "There's dignity and folly to The Tramp in City Lights, and everything in between.", "Chaplin's growing seriousness, his desire to be more than a mere comedian have deceived him into holding sentiment more precious than fun.", "City Lights gets to the heart of the Tramp. It is a beautiful romance about loving someone for who they are and not their social or economic status - and it features one of the most tear inducing and iconic endings in Hollywood history.", "", "", "A screen gem.
