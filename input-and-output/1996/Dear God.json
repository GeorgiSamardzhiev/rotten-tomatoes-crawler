{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In order to avoid a jail sentence, con man Tom Turner (Greg Kinnear) promises a judge he'll get an honest job for a year. But when he starts working in the U.S. Post Office's dead letter office, he's moved by some letters addressed directly to God. After he starts a Good Samaritan con by replying to the letters, his co-workers (Laurie Metcalf, Tim Conway, H\u00e9ctor Elizondo) are inspired to do the same.
