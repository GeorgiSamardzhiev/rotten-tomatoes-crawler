When he discovers her affair with Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings), he comes up with the perfect plan to kill her. He blackmails an old acquaintance into carrying out the murder, but the carefully-orchestrated set-up goes awry, and Margot stays alive.

It was filmed in 3-D with the faddish technology that was available at the time (but already going out of fashion)...", "The movie is worth seeing even now, if for no other aim than to show a man ambitiously experimenting with the devious facets that would inspire greater films.", "An exercise made by an enormously talented constructor of thrillers in the most fertile period of his career.", "The risk with clever thrillers is always that they will focus on pleasing the intellect at the expense of developing more depth. Dial M For Murder is a different kind of animal.", "Rather than let someone else mess with a play that has a formal perfection, Hitchcock did the adaptation himself, his only such credit while in Hollywood.", "Milland's sinister sophistication catches the eye, but Kelly's subtly shaded suffering is superb.", "Ray Milland is great as cold fish Tony Wendice, a former tennis pro who plans to bump off his adulterous wife. Still, Grace Kelly is mis-cast (or misdirected) as the spouse in question.", "The depth of focus, framing of characters and objects and use of the claustrophobic sets add extra pleasure to what was already a thoroughly enjoyable \"perfect crime\" nail-biter.", "The set-up is ingenious and the \"kill\" scene genuinely thrilling.", "Grace Kelly reaches out into the audience for murder scissors; foreground tea tables all but clonk your knees; a tell-tale door key - how many Hitchcock revelation moments feature those! - is brandished inches from your nose.", "Second tier Hitch perhaps, but no less enjoyable for it, and still a marvel of cinematic technique.", "Despite Hitchcock's own reservations this is definitely worth a look. Interesting to his aficionados and darkly funny and depressing in turns.", "A tightly wound psychological parlour game, expanded only slightly from its claustrophobic stage roots.", "This second-tier Hitchcock is best known for Grace Kelly's star turn and sleek production values, including use of 3D.", "Dial M for Murder is often dismissed as lesser Hitchcock, yet its intricate plot and sterling performances thrill me every time I watch it.", "Based on a magnificently intricate script ... it benefits immensely from Hitchcock's razor-sharp direction.", "...a completely watchable yet less-than-consistent effort from Hitchcock..."], "rating": ["9/10", "", "3/5", "A+", "3/4", "8/10", "4/5", "", "4/5", "3/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "B", "3.5/4", "3/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Derwent May", "PJ Nabarro", "Tim Dirks", "David Keyes", "Tim Brayton", "Jennie Kermode", "Philip French", "David Parkinson", "Charlotte O&#39;Sullivan", "Allan Hunter", "Peter Bradshaw", "Nigel Andrews", "Matthew Thrift", "David Parkinson", "Emma Dibdin", "Emanuel Levy", "Matt Brunson", "Mike Scott", "David Nusair"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sight and Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmsite", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaphile.org", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Eye for Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Observer (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Express (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Financial Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Little White Lies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times-Picayune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews"], "date": ["August 18, 2020", "April 16, 2020", "October 31, 2019", "September 29, 2019", "November 25, 2015", "July 5, 2014", "August 19, 2013", "July 28, 2013", "July 26, 2013", "July 26, 2013", "July 25, 2013", "July 25, 2013", "July 25, 2013", "July 25, 2013", "July 22, 2013", "July 16, 2013", "January 11, 2013", "October 13, 2012", "October 11, 2012", "October 5, 2012"]}}
