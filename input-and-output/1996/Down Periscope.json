{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Cmdr. Tom Dodge (Kelsey Grammer) is not thought of very highly among his fellow Navy officers. So when he's offered the captain's seat on a decrepit boat that is part of a simulated challenge on the water, no one expects much from him. Set on getting his underdog crew in line in order to win the event, Dodge must face off against his nemesis, Adm. Yancy Graham (Bruce Dern) -- who will do anything to see Dodge disgraced and finally kicked out of the Navy.", "rating": "12", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "David S.
