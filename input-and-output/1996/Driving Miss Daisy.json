{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Daisy Werthan (Jessica Tandy), an elderly Jewish widow living in Atlanta, is determined to maintain her independence. However, when she crashes her car, her son, Boolie (Dan Aykroyd), arranges for her to have a chauffeur, an African-American driver named Hoke Colburn (Morgan Freeman). Daisy and Hoke's relationship gets off to a rocky start, but they gradually form a close friendship over the years, one that transcends racial prejudices and social conventions.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "Bruce Beresford", "studio": "WarnerBrothers", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 3, 2008", "box_office": "$105.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It may be simple but it's brilliantly told, with frequent humor, realistic drama, and the invention of unforgettable screen characters.", "In Driving Miss Daisy...silence speaks volumes.", "This is a chamber movie with the courage to stay small and resonant.", "It romanticizes, rather than challenges the racial power politics it presents.", "For all the artistry in the background and behind the camera, Driving Miss Daisy is ultimately an acting showcase. And its stars are ultimately responsible for the delight it creates.", "Freeman is note-perfect with Hoke's dignified warmth, and Tandy, whose every moment on screen is an acting lesson, turns in what by far is the most hauntingly elegant performance of the year.", "A warm and tender, human story. [Full Review in Spanish]", "All the good in this film ends up being shipwrecked by a cloying, but predictable, ending. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Every one of these dramatic maelstroms manages to appear fresh because Freeman and Tandy somehow manage to come up with new approaches, meting out complementary aspects of their characters.", "Fine acting, subtle direction, good writing, in fact, a film for everyone to appreciate and enjoy.", "It's a story about interior lives and the gradual changes that love and respect can bring about. That's rare in today's movies, and it's something to be treasured.", "The movie never resorts to sentimentality. It has a dry wit as well as genuine warmth. Best of all it is the perfect showcase for two deserving actors -- Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman.", "One of the year's best films, a rarity in that a play has been successfully transferred to film without having the dialogue seem \"written.\"", "Driving Miss Daisy makes the simple point that combating racism can sometimes mean confronting a part of ourselves that we'd rather pretend does not exist. For Miss Daisy, it's as simple as admitting that Hoke is not just her driver, but her best friend.", "Driving Miss Daisy spans a quarter-century in the intricate relationship of a Southern dowager and her chauffeur, and it is a movie that invites you to appreciate the passage of time in more than one way.", "Jessica Tandy and Morgan Freeman give exceptional performances", "Freeman and Tandy have their own performer's pride, and that transfers to their characters. Tandy, in particular, is almost astringent in her denial of easy emotion.", "Embalmed in good intentions, Driving Miss Daisy is a creaky adaptation of a Pulitzer Prize-winning play.", "This is a story about people, not politics. And perhaps because we can see the actors in closeup on the screen, that is even truer of the movie than the play.", "Bruce Beresford gives a solid lift to his uneven career with his careful and colorful directing of Alfred Uhry's screenplay, based on Mr. Uhry's prize-winning stage play."], "rating": ["1", "", "", "", "", "", "", "2.5/5", "", "4.5/5", "5/5", "", "3.5/4", "3/4", "3/4", "A", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Brian D.
