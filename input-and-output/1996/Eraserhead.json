{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Henry (John Nance) resides alone in a bleak apartment surrounded by industrial gloom. When he discovers that an earlier fling with Mary X (Charlotte Stewart) left her pregnant, he marries the expectant mother and has her move in with him. Things take a decidedly strange turn when the couple's baby turns out to be a bizarre lizard-like creature that won't stop wailing. Other characters, including a disfigured lady who lives inside a radiator, inhabit the building and add to Henry's troubles.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Drama/Horror/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "David Lynch", "studio": "AmericanFilmInstitute", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An unparalleled film of strange beauty, Eraserhead might be one of the most perfect demonstrations of the power of film as a medium and an artistic achievement.", "Those black and white images stay with you; ingrained deeply in your soul.", "A hallucinatory drama with impeccable technique and exemplary cinematography. [Full Review in Spanish]", "German Expressionism meets grindhouse schlock, Eraserhead is a student film-turned-cult classic that probably would've been better as a 20-minute short.", "\"In heaven, everything is fine,\" but in Eraserhead (1977) nothing is fine. David Lynch's debut feature is grim, disturbed, mutated, claustrophobic, a world that appears to be unraveling-or, more accurately, decaying-before our eyes.", "Linear plots with easily defined cause and effect are the kinds of stories we are used to, but sometimes it's refreshing to enter a world where logic takes a backseat to purely evocative storytelling.", "It is the vision of the paranoid transposed upon the screen; the fact that it remains extremely interesting ought, I suppose, to be worrying. But perhaps our eyes have become so desensitised that nothing, any more, will widen the iris.", "It's beautiful and strange, with its profoundly disturbing ambient sound design of industrial groaning, as if filmed inside some collapsing factory or gigantic dying organism.", "What makes Eraserhead great -- and still, perhaps the best of all Lynch's films? Intensity. Nightmare clarity. And perhaps also it's the single-mindedness of its vision.", "David Lynch never explains because he doesn't need to, his is the faith of the irrational, disconcertingly childlike in its illusionism.", "A murkily pretentious shocker.", "David Lynch's Eraserhead must stand as a pinnacle of screen surrealism to rival Bunuel's Un Chien Andalou.", "You may never figure out the story or what it is meant to convey, but the lighting, effects, editing and directing are so dead on and beautifully executed that the visuals carry the piece over every question mark. In the end the questions beckon you back.", "Some would say that Lynch has painted himself into a corner and the easiest way out is to layer on the hallucinations and lapse into catatonia rather than address the issues at hand. Others would say that Lynch reaches the heights of profundity and art.", "a nightmarish spin down an industrial-wasteland rabbit hole that is equal parts surreal head-scratcher and emotionally driven horrorshow", "Sculpted out of blocks of stark light amid pools of impenetrable darkness.", "...expertly crafted, wildly imaginative and deeply, deeply disturbing", "The most terrifying film ever made.", "By now, the most interesting thing about Lynch's cult-classic debut may be the evidence it offers of how fully his sensibility was formed.", "As pure cinema, Eraserhead is in a universe all its own, writing and obeying its own oblique rules."], "rating": ["5/5", "", "", "3/5", "", "4/5", "", "5/5", "4/4", "", "", "", "7/10", "3.5/5", "4/4", "9/10", "4/4", "A+", "5/5", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "Rob Aldam", "Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos", "Christopher Lloyd", "Sean Axmaker", "Eric Melin", "Peter Ackroyd", "Peter Bradshaw", "Michael Wilmington", "Fernando F.
