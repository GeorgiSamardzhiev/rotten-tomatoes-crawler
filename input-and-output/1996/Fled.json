{"metadata": {"synopsis": "During a routine prison work detail, convict Piper (Laurence Fishburne) is chained to Dodge (Stephen Baldwin), a cyberhacker, when gunfire breaks out. Apparently, the attack is related to stolen money that the Mafia is after, and some computer files that somebody wants desperately to bury. The pair, who don't exactly enjoy each other's company, escape and must work together if they are to reach Atlanta alive. Luckily, they meet a woman (Salma Hayek) who may be willing to help them.", "rating": "18", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Kevin Hooks", "studio": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$17.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Even when violence and tragic incidents do occur, they're not exactly of the gut-wrenching kind.", "Filmmaker Kevin Hooks does a superb job of immediately drawing the viewer into the briskly-paced proceedings...", "Aren't you getting tired of battles over computer disks?", "My fondest memory involving Fled isn't in the film; it was the moment on Siskel & Ebert when Roger Ebert stated, 'I guess it sort of holds your attention while it's happening.
