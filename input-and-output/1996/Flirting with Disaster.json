{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Adopted as a child, new father Mel Colpin (Ben Stiller) decides he cannot name his son until he knows his birth parents, and determines to make a cross-country quest to find them. Accompanied by his wife, Nancy (Patricia Arquette), and an inept yet gorgeous adoption agent, Tina (Tea Leoni), he departs on an epic road trip that quickly devolves into a farce of mistaken identities, wrong turns, and overzealous and love-struck ATF agents (Josh Brolin, Richard Jenkins).", "rating": "87", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "David O.

It's what Russell does now, only far less serious.", "It's a road movie, and a family comedy, and neurotic Woody Allen-style rom-com, but none of those crisp, compact boxes can properly contain this wild, strange, unruly picture.", "David O. Russell has a twisted mind; I like that in a man.", "This whacked-out road comedy about a young man's search for his real parents takes any number of unexpected turns, most of them bitingly funny.", "Entertainment for the whole dysfunctional family.", "Boasting a clever title, this is an inspired piece of lunacy about sociology versus biology, with terrific performances from Ben Stiller and his two sets of parents.", "When I caught this modern-day screwball comedy in theaters I didn't think much of it, and it's even less appealing now.", "The neurotic frenzy threatens to annoy, but Russell's edgy, abbreviated style generates farcical comic friction without sacrificing character.", "One Stiller movie I actually enjoyed.", "If Russell is erratic with plot and the slightest bit smug in attitude, he makes up for these flaws by drawing fun, inspired performances from his ace cast.", "", "", "Avoiding the safety of the PC blanket, David O. Russell has crafted a canny, crafty and altogether adorable little misfit of a movie.", "", "Sounds like a French farce, you say? Well, you got that right.
