{"metadata": {"synopsis": "On the run from a bank robbery that left several police officers dead, Seth Gecko (George Clooney) and his paranoid, loose-cannon brother, Richard (Quentin Tarantino), hightail it to the Mexican border. Kidnapping preacher Jacob Fuller (Harvey Keitel) and his kids, the criminals sneak across the border in the family's RV and hole up in a topless bar. Unfortunately, the bar also happens to be home base for a gang of vampires, and the brothers and their hostages have to fight their way out.", "rating": "62", "genre": "Drama/Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Robert Rodriguez", "studio": "Miramax", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 26, 2016", "box_office": "$24.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["What an inexplicably bizarre, frequently ugly, intermittently nonsensical, confused experiment of a movie.", "Filmmaker Robert Rodriguez, working from Tarantino's screenplay, opens From Dusk Till Dawn with an electrifying pre-credits sequence revolving around a robbery gone horribly wrong...", "\"From Dusk Till Dawn\" answers the question about George Clooney, but raises a couple about Quentin Tarantino.", "[Robert] Rodriguez pushes the envelope but fails to make any lasting impression except revulsion at the spectacle of acclaimed independent filmmakers wasting their talents on such trash.", "Still sizzles like a capsaicin-spiked grindhouse meatloaf baked and served just under the wire of its sell-by date.", "This is the \"Reservoir Dogs\" with a twist of \"Near Dark\" set to the tune of \"Assault on Precinct 13.\"", "Based on an early Tarantino script, Rodriguez' movie is an incoherent B-pic, in which the sensibilities of the two filmmakers clash.", "It is a shame to see so much good talent giving such low-yield results.", "Energetic low-budget vampire nonsense from Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino.", "If you're going to like it, you already know it.", "Imagine two movies plucked from opposite sides of the video store.", "A deliriously trashy, exuberantly vulgar, lavishly appointed exploitation picture, this weird combo of road-kill movie and martial-arts vampire gorefest is made to order for the stimulation of teenage boys.", "On a mindless exploitation level this is pretty good, but on other levels it seems to make promises that it fails to deliver on.", "A tired, humorless pastiche of various exploitation genres that is not the least bit imaginative in its campy deconstruction of conventions.", "Nihilistic and initally unpleasant ...
