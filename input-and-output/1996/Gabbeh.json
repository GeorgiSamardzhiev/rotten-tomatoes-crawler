{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this Iranian romantic fantasy, an elderly married couple (Hossein Moharami, Roghieh Moharami) head to the river to wash their gabbeh, a traditional Persian carpet with a colorful illustration of a young woman woven into it. Suddenly, the figure in the design (Shaghayegh Djodat) springs miraculously to life, declares herself to be called Gabbeh, and then spins a story about her history, her family and the man she loved but was forbidden to marry.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 14m", "director": "Mohsen Makhmalbaf", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 6, 2018", "box_office": "$474.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "Makhmalbaf attempts to follow the carpet idea by making his film dreamily romantic and non-realistic.
