{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When actor and monologist Spalding Gray discovers that he has developed an eye ailment, he finds out that the condition can be corrected by a surgical procedure. Intent on avoiding surgery and time in a hospital at all costs, Gray sets out on a quest to find treatment via alternative medicine, which leads him to odd potential changes in his diet, psychic surgeons and sweat lodges. Gray's search for healing also brings him back to his upbringing as a Christian Scientist.", "rating": "57", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 20m", "director": "Steven Soderbergh", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$4.7K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Gray's Anatomy, in all its low budget glory, flourishes in its simplicity.", "Becomes a kind of strange examination of human existence; frail, idiosyncratic, and ultimately a kind of cosmic joke.", "It is haunting, though. How could it not be, when the last lines of the monolog are \"Ecstasy, despair, ecstasy, despair\" and some mention of a big fish?", "Soderbergh does (Gray) no favors with a series of overwrought stylistic choices.", "Visually inventive version of Gray's monologue, though the material is not as interesting as that of Swimming to Cambodia.", "", "", "", "The late Spalding Gray's monologue is typically fascinating, and Soderbergh's creative staging is a treat.", "A chatty, colorful, nicely sardonic account of how a crisis led Mr. Gray to assess his medical state, consider his mortality and take one more funny, self-dramatizing look at the eccentric world around him.", "At best, Gray is a tragicomic Everyman who strikes an empathic chord in his admiring audience; at worst, he's a middle-aged, self-absorbed, hopelessly provincial New Yorker -- an urban hick who won't shut up.", "Gray's Anatomy is a triumphant reminder of the power of words to summon our deepest fears.", "There's something intrinsically insincere about the whole quest. Gray is on a search less for a cure than for material.", "Gray's Anatomy finds Spalding Gray turning a bout with a bizarre ocular condition into a dizzying, absorbing odyssey of the neurotic mind.", "In spite of Soderbergh and the painful lack of an audience/laugh track, Gray's story is immediately compelling, proving that once again, a talking head can truly entertain an audience.", "Using every cinematic trick in the book, [director] Soderbergh turns Gray's one-man world into the most surreal mind-expander since Alice fell down the rabbit hole.", "If you cannot see Spalding Gray live, then do see his monologue films. Gray's Anatomy can be infuriating, but Spalding makes it worthwhile.", "Soderbergh is a gifted director (SEX, LIES AND VIDEOTAPE; KING OF THE HILL); Gray is a gifted monologist (SWIMMING TO CAMBODIA). They're just not a very good match for the creation of a film.", "Not only is it interesting to follow the course of Gray's storyline, the movie is also equally interesting to view, even if the storyteller is just sitting in front of a desk most of the time.", "The film manages to come off like a dinnertime conversation with a friend -- albeit a one-sided and long but very good and very funny one."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "2.5/4", "5/10", "C+", "2/5", "3/5", "2/5", "4/5", "3.5/5", "2.5/4", "", "2/4", "", "3.5/5", "B+", "2.5/4", "5/10", "3/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jordan M.
