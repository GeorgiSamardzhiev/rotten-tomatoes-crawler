{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When Joanna Drayton (Katharine Houghton), a free-thinking white woman, and black doctor John Prentice (Sidney Poitier) become engaged, they travel to San Francisco to meet her parents. Matt Drayton (Spencer Tracy) and his wife Christina (Katharine Hepburn) are wealthy liberals who must confront the latent racism the coming marriage arouses. Also attending the Draytons' dinner are Prentice's parents (Roy E. Glenn Sr., Beah Richards), who vehemently disapprove of the relationship.", "rating": "70", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Stanley Kramer", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "Dec 12, 1967", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Kramer's film does feel like a dusty time capsule. Still, as a film starring some of cinemas greatest actors, the combination of Hepburn, Poitier, and Tracy is still enough to hold the film's artifice at bay -- mostly.", "The story remains powerful, particularly as it isn't about forcing principles upon the audience.", "Stanley Kramer's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner is another of his Euclidean problems in human geometry, worked relentlessly through step-by-step to the last tear and the neat solution, both of which are designed to provide full satisfaction.", "Since Stanley Kramer's direction doesn't help much to resolve their dilemma, the actors are left looking wooden and uneasy. (The glorious exception is Spencer Tracy).", "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner toes the line between thoughtful, responsible social commentary and didactic messaging; their contents reflect a genuine national uncertainty...", "The film may feel somewhat dated, but the performances and the emotional and socially biting material remain spot on - maybe even more so now.", "The movie insidiously charms us into ignoring its defects, and for this the credit must go to a superb cast.", "...most notable for being a metatextual commentary on the onscreen/offscreen romance of Tracy and Hepburn.", "The film may have a foregone conclusion, but it's worth watching as the acting is so good.", "Initially breezy without ever sacrificing any of its points, the picture eventually resorts to a series of static speeches. Luckily, the actors carry the day, particularly Sidney Poitier, Cecil Kellaway and, taking MVP honors, Spencer Tracy.", "...an appealing premise that's employed to watchable (if entirely uneven) effect by filmmaker Stanley Kramer...", "...rather tame and superficial by today's standards: a gentle, sentimental comedy on the subject of interracial marriage.", "Civil rights, love, and family stress.", "", "Tracy looks tired in this draggy production; he died soon afterward, and it's infuriating to watch him sweat to inject fire into such pap.", "There are wonderful performances here, as you'd expect from Hepburn and Tracy, and there's no question that the film is well intentioned. Yet it's also hamfisted and self-congratulatory in the most galling way.", "A disaster on all counts -- its time, if it ever had one, has definitely passed.", "Billed as Hollywood's first major film about interracial marriage (though no kiss on the lips is allowed), the film begs one question: What mother in her right mind would object to Poitier as son in law--he's handsome, renowned professional, and gentleman", "A wishy-washy, sanctimonious plea for tolerance, directed with Kramer's customary verbosity and stodginess.", "If you guessed, 'a wheezy social problem drama,' you're right."], "rating": ["3/5", "1", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "7/10", "4/5", "3/4", "2.5/4", "6/10", "4/5", "5/5", "2.5/4", "", "", "C+", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "Mike Massie", "Robert Kotlowitz", "Ann Birstein", "Adam Nayman", "Tom Meek", "Brendan Gill", "Nathanael Hood", "Tom Hutchinson", "Matt Brunson", "David Nusair", "John J.
