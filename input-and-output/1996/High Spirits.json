{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Irish hotelier Peter Plunkett (Peter O'Toole) attempts to fill the chronic vacancies at his castle by launching an advertising campaign that wrongly portrays the property as haunted. Unfortunately, he fails to scare a single American tourist with his hokey and dreadfully unconvincing effects. When two actual ghosts, Mary (Daryl Hannah) and Martin (Liam Neeson), show up to add some authenticity, they end up falling for two guests, Sharon (Beverly D'Angelo) and Jack (Steve Guttenberg).", "rating": "27", "genre": "Comedy/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "Neil Jordan", "studio": "VisionPDG,Palace", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 17, 2017", "box_office": "$7.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Although flawed with a hopelessly off-the-wall story and visual jokes that fall flat, there are still enough unique elements to warrant a viewing for the curious.", "High Spirits is cheesy, slapdash, and not exactly up to snuff to today's standards of gender politics, but Halloween-appropriate nonetheless.", "It is a cast perfectly blended to this story of human foibles and eternal love.
