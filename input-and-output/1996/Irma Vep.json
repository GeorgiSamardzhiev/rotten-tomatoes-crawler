{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Washed-up French director Ren\u00e9 Vidal (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) hopes to turn his career around with an update of \"Les Vampires,\" a silent-era masterpiece about about a notorious ring of thieves, led by crafty female crook Irma Vep. Ren\u00e9 brings in Chinese star Maggie Cheung (Maggie Cheung) to play Vep, but unexpected roadblocks arise on the set. Maggie doesn't know French, she's pursued by obsessive lesbian crew member Zoe (Nathalie Richard) and her character's criminal ways begin to rub off on her.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "Olivier Assayas", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 9, 2016", "box_office": "$191.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Irma Vep is a magnificently varied film, integrating film footage, press interviews, gossip, and film's hurry-up-and-wait production schedule. Cheung in particular does a masterful job playing herself, at once transparent and opaque.", "An exhilarating film that happens to be about moviemaking itself, Olivier Assayas's sinuous, kinetic, waggish Irma Vep is an oblique, supremely enjoyable course in movie history.", "A funny and fascinatingly open-ended look at the state of the art, Irma Vep is well worth a look.", "If you're going to poke fun at the film industry, you might as well go for broke.", "I really enjoyed \"Irma Vep.\" I will, however, be the first to admit that it's not for everybody.", "Though Irma Vep may be best appreciated by movieheads, it's hardly just an homage. By its shrieking avant-garde climax, it's more like a statement on how history, even filmed history, can fragment and dissolve into oblivion.", "Irma Vep is undeniably a complex and thought provoking work - but compared to the comparatively human films Assayas has made recently, it can't help but feel less rewarding as a result.", "Light, playful, and self-reflexive, Assayas' film is a mi or work but it's enjoyable and boasts a graceful performance from Maggie Cheung.", "The post-modern compulsions on display here may bring movies together, but they also keep people apart.", "A wonderful tribute to filmmaking that could only be made in France, it has delightful performances and a low-budget style -- like the film it parodies -- which work beautifully.", "Irma Vep's director, Olivier Assayas, evinces a love of the process that's nearly as palpable as Truffaut's.", "Slender but appealing.", "", "A delightfully nonchalant movie, complete with some nice satirical barbs aimed at contemporary French film culture, and fine performances throughout.", "Amusing satire on French cinema and the insanity that is filmmaking.", "", "", "We just love to make movies about movies to deconstruct them, to see what's behind them.", "", "Cheung, slinking around the corridors of her hotel in her sheath of shiny black latex to the dissonant chords of Sonic Youth, is an instant icon of everything cool."], "rating": ["", "", "", "8/10", "", "", "7/10", "B+", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "2/5", "", "3/4", "3/5", "5/5", "4/4", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Alyx Vesey", "Melissa Anderson", "Keith Phipps", "Jared Mobarak", "Paul Tatara", "Michael Atkinson", "Alistair Ryder", "Emanuel Levy", "Fernando F.
