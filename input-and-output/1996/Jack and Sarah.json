{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After his wife, Sarah (Imogen Stubbs), dies during childbirth, Jack (Richard E. Grant), an attorney, has his world thrown into a whirlwind. Unequipped to handle the pressures of a demanding career and raising an infant daughter on his own, Jack finds help through a local vagrant (Ian McKellen) and submits to hiring a nanny. But the woman he hires is a waitress (Samantha Mathis) who is entirely inexperienced -- much to the disapproval of Jack's mother, Margaret (Judi Dench).", "rating": "74", "genre": "Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 50m", "director": "Tim Sullivan", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$114.8K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This picture is uneven and a bit long, and it suffers from the pompous hamming of Ian McKellen as a patronizing old wino.

Unfortunately, the movie has very little comedy to offer in place of such antics.", "The movie's big problem is Mathis, who not only can't act but also is given a rather unattractive role to play.", "\"Jack & Sarah\" is one of those romantic movies viewers know will end in a happy smooch. What's fine is the rush of amusing, heartrending humanity before it gets to the inevitable.", "The screenplay, by Tim Sullivan (who also directs), is straight off the assembly line.
