{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Based on a popular short film, this comedy focuses on Joe (Jerry O'Connell), a young man who has moved from Iowa to downtown New York City. After settling into his grimy apartment, Joe discovers that it is home to a legion of talking and singing cockroaches. Although having so many bugs for roommates has its drawbacks, Joe finds the roaches to be friendly and good-natured, and they aid him in wooing the lovely Lily (Megan Ward), as well as in contending with his mean landlord (Don Ho).", "rating": "19", "genre": "Comedy/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 20m", "director": "John Payson", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,GeffenPictures,MTVNetworks", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 15, 2008", "box_office": "$4.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "It's nicely realised, by human and roach alike, and something of a landmark in cinematic grossness.", "If it were even half as clever as the promotional web site -- which features such inventions as ROL, a parody of online service AOL -- it would be a small delight.
