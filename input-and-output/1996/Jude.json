{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In late 19th-century England, Jude (Christopher Eccleston) aspires to be an academic, but is hobbled by his blue-collar background. Instead, he works as a stonemason and is trapped in an unloving marriage to a farmer's daughter named Arabella (Rachel Griffiths). But when his wife leaves him, Jude sees an opportunity to improve himself. He moves to the city and begins an affair with his married cousin, Sue (Kate Winslet), courting tragedy every step of the way.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 3m", "director": "Michael Winterbottom", "studio": "PolyGramFilmedEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$419.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Jude is masterfully rendered.", "The film has its period down cold, but what makes it special is its nerve, about which the best you can say is that it matches Hardy's own.", "It's good quality stuff, but sublimely miserable.", "It's worth seeing Jude, a stark adaptation of Thomas Hardy's Jude the Obscure, just for the extraordinary performance of Christopher Eccleston as Jude Fawley.", "Young English actress Kate Winslet adds luster and energy to Jude, a bold and generally successful attempt to adapt Thomas Hardy's final novel, Jude the Obscure, to the bigscreen.", "Without the benefit of Hardy's prose, the point of the movie is lost in the grim, grayish ether.", "Ambitious, sensitive, but ultimately uninvolving.", "Superbly acted by all involved.", "", "Jude isn't a movie to see as entertainment, but is a strong contemplation on man's struggle to overcome oppressive odds.", "", "Sometimes outstanding but is a not always satisfying screen adaptation of Thomas Hardy's last novel.", "", "Among the very best, frankest, and most honest of recent literary adaptations.", "", "Jude remains a handsome if gravely flawed film.", "Harrowing and compelling screen adaptation of Thomas Hardy's novel set in 19th century England", "", "Faithfully adapted from Thomas Hardy's novel, Jude (minus the Obscure)...It's also a difficult film to like because it is, simply put, a downer.", "...as modern British historical films go, this is visually one of the most impressive."], "rating": ["", "3/4", "", "B", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "2/5", "B", "4/5", "B", "7/10", "4/5", "5/5", "3/5", "", "2/5", "3.5/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Brian D.
