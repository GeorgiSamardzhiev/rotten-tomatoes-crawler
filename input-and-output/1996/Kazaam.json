{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A genie named Kazaam (Shaquille O'Neal) has been sealed up for thousands of years, until one day he is accidentally freed by Max (Francis Capra), who is on the run from a local gang. Kazaam explains to the youth that he belongs to Max until he grants three wishes, but what Max really wants is to get to know his estranged father. When the genie, who considers trying his hand at a music career, forgets about his young master, Max is attacked by villainous club owner Malik (Marshall Manesh).", "rating": "5", "genre": "Comedy/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Paul Michael Glaser", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 12, 2017", "box_office": "$18.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Bad fantasy comedy is dated and materialistic; bullying.", "The movie looked lively and imaginative in the trailer that has been showing for months. Stretch it out to 92 minutes, though, and you realize that the entire thing was effectively and attractively squeezed into the preview.", "It's marketing, not moviemaking.", "Ultimately this is a kids-only affair.", "Dismal.", "It's hard to ignore the unpleasant implications of a scenario that involves a small white boy lording it over an African-American man twice his size.", "In his Hollywood debut, Shaq more or less played himself as a coveted college center in William Friedkin's excellent Blue Chips. Kazaam is a compelling argument for keeping him on the court and as far away from a movie set as possible.", "Kazaam puts up a brick.", "The plot is hamstrung by trite formulas, and there's too much violence and family tension for very young viewers. Shaquille O'Neal is likable as the title character, though.", "Are you bored yet?", "Good ol' Shaq, the big happy galoot, makes you smile just by showing up. Because of him, Kazaam is a minimal kid-pleaser, but because the trailers made us dream of genie, we can't help being disappointed when we get a turbaned social worker.", "I'd call the film innocuous, except that Max's gangster dad is apparently an Italian-American and the movie's main villain is an Arab. Do kids really need these stereotypes reinforced? There's also more violence here than you might expect.", "Kazaam never brings off the trick we most want to see: It fails to make the jolly, 7-foot-1 Shaq larger than life.", "Too gritty, violent and downbeat for tykes, it's also a bit juvenile and fairy tale-like for teens and older auds.", "", "", "Prime MST3K material, ripe for the ripping.", "", "Horrible kids movie. The kid is annoying and there's no clever humor.", "As fairy tale, buddy comedy, family drama, thriller or rap revue, Kazaam is simply uninspired and unconvincing, and Mr. O'Neal, who can carry a basketball team, lacks the charisma to rescue this misguided effort."], "rating": ["1/5", "2/4", "1/4", "2/5", "1/5", "2/4", "1.5/4", "1.5/4", "3/4", "1/4", "", "1/5", "D+", "", "1/5", "1/5", "0/4", "0/5", "0/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Alistair Lawrence", "Mal Vincent", "Gene Siskel", "John Ferguson", "Barry McIlheney", "", "Desmond Ryan", "Mary Flannery", "David Sterritt", "John Petrakis", "Rod Dreher", "Jay Boyar", "Owen Gleiberman", "Godfrey Cheshire", "Cole Smithey", "Daniel M.
