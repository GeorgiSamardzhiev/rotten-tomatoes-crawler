When African immigrant Amidou (Rasmane Ouedraogo) tumbles from a scaffold, Igor finds him before he dies and promises that he will take care of his wife and baby. Forced by his father to cover up the death, Igor struggles to choose between loyalty to his unsavory parent and keeping the promise that he made to the dying man.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 34m", "director": "Jean-Pierre Dardenne, Luc Dardenne", "studio": "Eurimages", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 23, 2017", "box_office": "$454.7K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The Dardennes' film is unfussy and the revelations small but that is why it is so affecting.", "(The Dardennes') \"first\" film has attained a special place in the hearts of critics and other viewers.
