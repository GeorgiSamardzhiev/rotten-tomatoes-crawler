{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the year 2274, young residents enjoy an idyllic, hedonistic lifestyle within the protective confines of a domed city. The general belief is that when each person turns 30, they are reincarnated for another blissful life cycle. Those who know the much darker truth become \"runners\" and flee to a hidden sanctuary. When law enforcement officer Logan (Michael York) goes undercover to locate the refuge, he winds up instead trying to initiate a revolution with runner Jessica (Jenny Agutter).", "rating": "62", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 58m", "director": "Michael Anderson", "studio": "MetroGoldwynMayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 1, 2008", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Logan's Run allows the viewer's imagination to run free in a whole new world.
