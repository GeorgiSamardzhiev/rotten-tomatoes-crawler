[Full review in Spanish]", "The darkness in Long Day's Journey into Night is comforting, seductive and beautiful, never ominous or threatening.", "Savor it. Dive into its wrinkles and swim in its sulci. Aside from some pacing issues, it's a half-remembered dream to behold.", "Long Day's Journey into Night is a risky film to launch anywhere, being slow in its exposition and resistant to easy interpretation. Approach with caution but, if in doubt, approach it anyway.", "Bi [Gan] creates a sense of atmosphere that's superbly engulfing, filling scenes with subtle touches that add intrigue to a narrative that has very little pace.", "[F]ans of directors Alain Resnais, David Lynch, Hou Hsiao-hsien, Nicolas Roeg, and Wong Kar-wai will likely find this art-house stunner an enrapturing experience.", "A wonderfully eerie watch.", "It's a vanishingly rare occurrence to see something on screen and be unable to wrap your head around how it was achieved. But in Long Day's Journey Into Night... some kind of sorcery is at work.", "A slow, beautifully shot, film noir mystery, Long Day's Journey into Night propels us into a transcendental state, where we don't really know what's real and what's imagination.", "Its final, hour-long single take tracking shot is not only a marvel of technical ingenuity, it's like an out-of-body experience that shatters the boundaries of what cinema can do.", "...this is a beautiful, delicate affair, where the transitory and the eternal meet in a kiss. As an exploration of yearning, Bi's romantic mystery, calmly and quietly, delivers fireworks.", "There are touches of Kafka, also of Tarkovsky, to this dream-like and beguilingly non-literal film that concludes with an audacious 3D sequence that explains everything, and nothing.", "This is immersive cinema, designed to be experienced rather than just watched.", "There is such artistry and audacity in this new film from 30-year-old Chinese director Bi Gan.", "Little of this adds up, unless you like films in which two plus two equals nine.", "If one could go past the lack of coherence in the narrative and instead focus on its aesthetics, however, he would definitely enjoy a truly artful movie.", "The camera movement feels purposeful and imbued with meaning, even when it's not obviously apparent. Credit has to go to Huang Jue, who anchors the film in real emotions of love and loss, doing some great acting with merely body movement alone.", "It's so evocative and impressionistic...
