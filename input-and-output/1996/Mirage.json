But Ristovski needs us to feel his nation's torment, and he succeeds.", "Though its downward trajectory may be obvious, the script is a marvel of clarity, economy and metaphor.", "It's a grim look at the life of one boy in a country that, at least in Mr. Ristovski's view, seems to have nothing but grimness to offer.", "Marko's story is far from novel, but its wicked evocation of hopelessness transcends any familiarities.", "The social situation at the heart of 'Mirage/Iluzija' is so fraught with political implication that the film hits on both levels.", "Svetozar Ristovski drags the corpse of Billy Elliott through sewer water in his appropriately titled Mirage--the film is so unreal, only a starved and weak-kneed cinesnob will be suckered in by it.", "Disturbing and powerful."], "rating": ["", "", "3/4", "1.5/4", "2.5/4", "", "3/5", "", "", "1.5/4", "3.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Frank Scheck", "Andrew Sarris", "Ken Fox", "Kyle Smith", "Elizabeth Weitzman", "Eddie Cockrell", "Neil Genzlinger", "Peter L&#39;Official", "Donald J.
