{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A comedic send-up of the grim circumstances of the Middle Ages as told through the story of King Arthur and framed by a modern-day murder investigation. When the mythical king of the Britons leads his knights on a quest for the Holy Grail, they face a wide array of horrors, including a persistent Black Knight, a three-headed giant, a cadre of shrubbery-challenged knights, the perilous Castle Anthrax, a killer rabbit, a house of virgins, and a handful of rude Frenchmen.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Terry Gilliam, Terry Jones", "studio": "MichaelWhiteProductions,Python(Monty)PicturesLimited,NationalFilmTrusteeCompany", "theater_date": "Apr 1, 1975", "dvd_date": "Mar 17, 2017", "box_office": "$1.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A gut-bustingly hilarious cult classic which remains just as funny and wonderfully ridiculous, the Monty Python crew's comic exploration of the Dark Ages has lost none of its silly charm.", "Some sketches are amusing, others are funny, and a rare few are altogether side-splitting.", "Worth a look if you've never seen it, but real fans know the best is yet to come.", "There are classic bits here about plagues, witches and chivalry, but their best scenes poke fun at ye olden days while stating that after 900 years, nothing has changed.", "The film goes on working a sense of humor that grows great in the continuous absurdity that always characterized the English work. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The first non-sketch Python film is one of the great Arthurian romps.", "Terribly exciting and clever, and while its sharpness has been considerably blunted through time, you can still tell where it once was.", "A fresh look at the ultimate mock epic, after the Python method has been assimilated into the cultural DNA, reveals the subversive spirit of this bloody and cynical Arthurian deconstruction.", "The material is superb, Neil Innes' music is tremendous and Gilliam's animations are timelessly brilliant.", "So unnecessarily gorgeous, there are moments where it feels like Tarkovsky with drag and farting.", "Watching it, it's hard to believe that these guys were actually meandering across heaths and trudging across rope bridges, with electricians and caterers not far away. It seems more as if this souvenir of the Absurd Ages has... existed for a millennium.", "The Python team's surreal take on the legend of Camelot bursts with inspired lunacy.", "This remains a wonderfully inventive comedy that brilliantly debunks the Dark Ages and legends of chivalry.", "Here is Monty Python and the Holy Grail, which is neither as sparkling as it is said to be nor as bad as it seems to be at the start. But it's pretty good.", "Monty Python and the Holy Grail may be 26 years old, but even in the fast-moving world of pop culture, it's no relic. It's still the Holy Grail of crazy comedy.", "There's a semblance of a plot, but this is really just an excuse for the boys to engage in their unique brand of humor, which includes mimicry, dress-up, dry wit, slapstick and glorious non sequitors.", "If you like this film, the sad truth is that it's yet another visual upgrade, and it does contain what Gilliam called \"the only reason for buying the Blu-ray\"-those lost animations.", "Grail is as funny as a movie can get, but it is also a tough-minded picture -- as outraged about the human propensity for violence as it is outrageous in its attack on that propensity.", "A comedy classic that only misses out on the Python canon's top spot because the talented swines also made Life Of Brian.", "There's something about feature films that brings out the best in the Pythons.
