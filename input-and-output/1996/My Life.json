But Bob's life is turned upside-down when he is diagnosed with cancer and given four months to live -- not even enough time to see his first child's birth. To cleanse himself of demons in his remaining days, Bob makes a video diary, hoping to pass along some wisdom to his future child. Along the way, he discovers a lot about himself.", "rating": "42", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "Bruce Joel Rubin", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation,CapellaFilms,ZuckerBrothersProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$27.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The only thing dense and expansive... is the sentimentality.", "If there are a few nuggets of wit and wisdom buried under the film's disease-of-the-week surface, Rubin doesn't find them.", "Even as the characters grow huffy and \"confront\" each other, the movie never loses its compulsive desire to soothe.", "My Life should be a more rigorous and single-minded film; maybe it started that way, before getting spoonfuls of honey to make the medicine go down.", "The overall narrative seems to drag itself out like a lengthy illness.", "This is the kind of bittersweet, dire-affliction performance that always bowls over the Motion Picture Academy voters.
