If you dare reach for it, it will land smartly in your heart.", "A charming little comedy grounded in an irresistable performance from Kathleen Turner.", "It's grave, lumbering, arrhythmic, and bloated, an emotional hogwallow of catchpenny insights and easy sentimentality.", "The movie has many lovely moments and just as many dead spots, but its strengths make this atypical film from Francis Coppola a worthwhile viewing experience.", "What makes this treatment unique is that the jokes aren't so much derivative of pop culture, but are instead found in the learned wisdom of a middle-aged woman reacting to her own teenage dilemmas.", "Centering on a female protag (well-played by Kathleen Turner) and dealing with a similar universal fantasy of revisiting your past, Coppola's small-town fable is a wonderful companion piece to Back to the Future, which was released a year earlier.", "Coppola displays a rare light and comedic touch in this charmer.", "Ignore the ridiculous happy ending of this film, and you have a much more fatalistic exercise in which Coppola eschews easy laughs in favour of the exposure of feeling and the fact that these people's lives, however empty, matter to them.", "Nicolas Cage lets the comedy rip. \"You mean my wang?\"", "One of the best romantic comedies of the 80's....\"Back to the Future\" meets \"Somewhere in Time\"", "", "A very entertaining and involving movie boasting a cornucopia of delightful comic moments and scenes which go straight for the heart.", "", "Twisted, touching and a great vehicle for Turner", "", "Miss Turner's self-assured comic timing goes a long way toward salvaging the film, providing both moral and physical dimension to a role that scarcely exists."], "rating": ["2.5/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "B+", "3/5", "", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "5/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "2.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Nusair", "Kathi Maio", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Brandon Judell", "Richard Corliss", "Film4 Staff", "Pat Graham", "", "Variety Staff", "Emanuel Levy", "Rob Thomas", "", "Cole Smithey", "Caffeinated Clint", "Philip Martin", "Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat", "Sarah Chauncey", "James Sanford", "Michael Szymanski", "Vincent Canby"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sojourner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">GreenCine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Capital Times (Madison, WI)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Moviehole", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spirituality &amp; Practice", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Kalamazoo Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Zap2it.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times"], "date": ["April 24, 2020", "August 23, 2019", "July 30, 2013", "September 28, 2012", "December 14, 2008", "December 14, 2008", "December 11, 2007", "December 11, 2007", "December 11, 2007", "April 4, 2007", "July 6, 2006", "February 9, 2006", "December 5, 2005", "June 11, 2005", "January 27, 2005", "August 18, 2004", "June 4, 2004", "July 10, 2003", "July 8, 2003", "May 20, 2003"]}}
