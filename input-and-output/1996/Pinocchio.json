For Benigni it wasn't Shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but Pinocchio. It might as well have been Problem Child IV.", "What's most incredible is not that Benigni thought that he could pull off a believable wooden puppet who wants to be a boy, nor thet he could turn such a charming story into such a horrifically scary tale, but that the people of Italy love this movie so m", "This overproduced piece of dreck is shockingly bad and absolutely unnecessary. Hmmm...might I suggest that the wayward wooden one end it all by stuffing himself into an electric pencil sharpener?", "Benigni presents himself as the boy puppet Pinocchio, complete with receding hairline, weathered countenance and American Breckin Meyer's ridiculously inappropriate Valley Boy voice.", "The dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed.", "Seriously, rent the Disney version.", "Adults will certainly want to spend their time in the theater thinking up grocery lists and ways to tell their kids how not to act like Pinocchio. As for children, they won't enjoy the movie at all.", "It's a frightful vanity film that, no doubt, pays off what debt Miramax felt they owed to Benigni.", "If you saw Benigni's Pinocchio at a public park, you'd grab your kids and run and then probably call the police.", "Chalk it up as the worst kind of hubristic folly."], "rating": ["1/4", "1/5", "D", "0/5", "1/4", "", "0/4", "2/5", "C-", "3/10", "", "1/4", "1.5/4", "", "1.5/4", "D+", "2/5", "1/10", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Matt Brunson", "Renee Schonfeld", "Eric D.
