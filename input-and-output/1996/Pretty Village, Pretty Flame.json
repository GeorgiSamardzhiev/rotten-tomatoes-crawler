But when, years later, war comes, they find themselves on opposing sides of a horrific, inhumane conflict. Milan's troop ends up trapped in a newly built tunnel, surrounded by enemy soldiers. One by one they recount their experiences, and one by one they're wounded or killed.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Special Interest", "runtime": "2h 8m", "director": "Srdjan Dragojevic", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "", "This bleak tale is told from the point-of-view of the Serb soldier who is severely wounded in a Belgrade hospital in 1994."], "rating": ["4/5", "4/5", "C+"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Emanuel Levy", "", "Dennis Schwartz"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews"], "date": ["June 26, 2005", "July 30, 2003", "February 14, 2001"]}}
