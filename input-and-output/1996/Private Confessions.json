{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Five conversations frame a flawed marriage in this film written by Ingmar Bergman about his parents. Guilt-ridden wife Anna (Pernilla August) divulges an extramarital affair to a priest, her uncle Jacob (Max von Sydow). He presses her to confess her sins to her husband, Henrik. As the film moves back and forth in time, the notion of truth is tested. Tomas, the lover, and Henrik will find that Anna's confessions do not absolve anyone, and have the power to inflict more pain.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Television", "runtime": "2h 7m", "director": "Liv Ullmann", "studio": "SVTDrama", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "Ullman isn't particularly interested in the angst of human interaction or the difficulty of knowing truth; she seems fascinated by the pathos of feelings that are all the more intense for being of questionable integrity.", "Each sequence is introduced by an intertitle suggesting it will contain an isolated conversation, an archly inaccurate notion that deepens the drama by appearing to deny its complexity.", "The sight of von Sydow vomiting up a communion wafer is a pretty good indication that age hasn't mellowed the master one whit.", "Ullmann handles the rich material with simplicity and feeling, using snatches of classical music only sparingly and concentrating on the faces of her exemplary cast.", "The actors clearly respond, August conveying the turmoil of a woman trapped by circumstances and her own febrile emotions, Sydow a figure of towering moral authority and compassion.", "", "Coming from the master's hand, the result is unique, akin to a deep plunge into a northern lake -- there's a chilling clarity to the experience, a harsh beauty that's softened, yet never redeemed, by unexpected pockets of relative warmth.", "It works, and works beautifully, principally because of an outstanding performance by Ms. August.", "Bergman may have withdrawn from film direction, but his presence is deeply felt in Private Confessions.", "A film like Private Confessions makes most films about romance look like films about plumbing.", "Private Confessions achieves an enveloping intensity that goes well beyond its occasionally literal and earnest approach.", "It's the next best thing to Bergman -- a thoughtful, if slightly long drama enlivened by warm performances and some thoughtful meditations on the subject of adultery.", "Von Sydow is magisterial. His gaunt face and rumbling voice have become, for me, impossible to distinguish from Bergman's own.", "I doubt that Bergman's script would have made much of a film even if he had directed it himself, but it might have been less confused.", "The reward for a pace that's sometimes frustratingly slow is in seeing truths and levels of emotion that are rarely captured on screen.", ""], "rating": ["A-", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "2/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "3.5/4", "4/5", "3/4", "", "", "3/4", "A-"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Owen Gleiberman", "Ronnie Scheib", "Lisa Alspector", "Ken Fox", "David Stratton", "Trevor Johnston", "Emanuel Levy", "Rick Groen", "Harvey S.
