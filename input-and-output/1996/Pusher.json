{"metadata": {"synopsis": "As a heroin dealer in Copenhagen, Frank (Kim Bodnia) is far from the top but earns good money pushing with a friend (Mads Mikkelsen). When he decides to up the ante, Frank goes to Milo (Zlatko Buric), a drug lord -- except he doesn't have enough money for the heroin. Instead, Milo fronts him the goods upon the condition of immediate repayment. But when Frank goes to make the deal, and the police arrive, he has to ditch the drugs. Now Frank has to find a way to repay Milo if he wants to live.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Nicolas Winding Refn", "studio": "BalboaEntertainment", "theater_date": "Aug 18, 2006", "dvd_date": "Mar 23, 2017", "box_office": "$4.4K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Full of resonant themes not simply confined to the crime/drug world.", "The kind of stuff Miramax used to pump into the Angelika like Fruitopia.", "", "Outstandingly well-done for a first-time director with no formal training on a shoestring budget, but something about it is unappealingly typical.", "Refn's electrifying debut soon morphs into something far more opaque and unsettling than a mere genre retread.", "First in a series of 3 films about Copenhagen drug dealers.
