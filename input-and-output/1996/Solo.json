{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Android military weapon Solo (Mario Van Peebles) is designed to put down Latin American rebels. But when Solo arrives, the machine feels compassion for the rebels fighting for freedom. Despite Solo's design, he begins fighting for the people he's supposed to kill. When his creators, including Gen. Haynes (Barry Corbin), attempt to bring him back, he flees. But the military doesn't give up. They send an upgraded android into the field to take Solo -- and the villagers -- down.", "rating": "8", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 34m", "director": "Norberto Barba", "studio": "TriumphFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$4.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It doesn't disappoint when it comes to blowing things up, discharging firearms, and giving Solo an opportunity to dish out payback to his brutal squadron of superior officers.", "An altogether nonsensical bit of action/sci-fi garbage that marries a dreadful script with hilariously chintzy action.", "He's The Terminator's distant cousin. He's Solo, and he's jerrybuilt from parts of so many other movies that it's hard to recognize a single original element in this android-warrior saga with Mario Van Peebles in the thankless title role.", "The action is neither big nor imaginatively filmed enough to satisfy fans of the genre, though Van Peebles seems to be enjoying his crack at sad-eyed, Chaplinesque pathos.", "These escapist showdown movies are only as good as their villains and heroes. The heavies here are more of those ubiquitous gung-ho military types who are due to be dishonorably discharged from further cinematic duty.", "There are too many moments of unintentional comedy caused by the ropey macho dialogue and the hammy performances of bad guys William Sadler and Barry Corbin.", "Here's a surprise tucked into the languishing days of summer movies. Arriving with hardly any attention is a satisfying, even fun, action picture about a futuristic soldier named Solo.", "Since the hero and the villains are equally mechanical, the big, loud battles are as exciting and suspenseful as watching people play Mortal Kombat for 90 minutes.", "Solo is at least instructive as a miscellany of action movie cliches in one neat and depressing package.", "Solo contains the usual shoot-'em-ups, an undistinguished performance from Van Peebles, plus lots of crummy dialogue.", "Mindless entertainment for the end of the summer, with emphasis on the mindless.", "", "The best one can say for Norberto Barba is that he directs a slick piece of goods.
