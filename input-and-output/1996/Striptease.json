{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When her ex-husband gets custody of their daughter, former FBI office assistant Erin Grant (Demi Moore) needs money to fight the legal case to get her child back. As a result, she takes a job dancing at the Eager Beaver strip club in Miami, where she befriends an imposing bouncer named Shad (Ving Rhames). Unfortunately, she also becomes an object of obsession for politician David Dilbeck (Burt Reynolds), who gets what he wants through charm and violence -- and what he wants is Erin.", "rating": "11", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Andrew Bergman", "studio": "CastleRockEntertainment,Lobell/BergmanProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2009", "box_office": "$32.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Slack stuff.", "I don't know if the lawyers are currently scanning the contracts for Striptease in order to find out what went wrong in the small print, but someone got badly conned; and that someone is mostly the audience.", "Yet another case of the star's salary being much more interesting, and exuberantly vulgar, than anything the screen reveals.", "The Striptease script... is at a loss for any kind of drama between Moore's dances. Not for a second do we care about her as a mother, wife or working woman.", "The film's premise is thinner than the heroine's G-string.", "Bergman, who made The Freshman and Honeymoon in Vegas, provides quotable one-liners for everyone (especially Rhames), and a bevy of strippers lend colorful albeit stereotypically ditzy support.", "Men will doubtless be lured to Striptease by Moore's beautifully sculpted body. But it's the heart she puts into Erin that gives this more erratic than erotic picture the centering presence it needs.", "If you get stuck at Striptease, my advice is to relax and try to enjoy its occasional pleasures.", "Writer-director Andrew Bergman presents [Moore] as a rather abstract object of desire. He wants us to know that his mind, at least, is not in the gutter--can't afford to waste time there, given the amount of busy work he has to.", "The result is a perversely odd concoction: a comedy that has fun with everything but stripping -- which, post-Showgirls, would seem to wear the biggest bull's-eye.", "Striptease is not a disaster like that other expensive ecdysiast extravaganza, Showgirls, though if it were, it might at least have some redeeming camp awfulness to enliven its otherwise dull mediocrity.", "For all its matter-of-fact nudity and wealth of silicon-heavy exotic dancers, the film lacks any palpable sense of eroticism.", "Striptease stinks. Yes, that's a crude, perhaps even rude, assessment. But crude and rude are the two terms that sum up this alleged comedy.", "Although the movie is a bit too long, oddball humor and a likable cast keep it entertaining.", "Striptease is an amiable comedy with ambitions to be a satire, but its thriller plot keeps getting in the way of the yucks.", "This may sound like a suspense movie, but it's not. There's no mystery (we know who the bad guys are) and the damsel-in-distress angle generates zero tension.", "Andrew Bergman's direction makes it watchable, but his screenplay pulls its punches on the sleaze, and tear-jerking sentimentality and inadequate humour don't combine well with the drama.", "The Fort Lauderdale setting imparts little flavor or atmosphere, and the same goes for the flagrantly unerotic dances.", "Kinda made me homesick for Showgirls.", "Moore, the most overrated star since Comet Kohoutek, is dreadful, dreadful in this thoroughly disappointing film version of Carl Hiaasen's hilarious novel."], "rating": ["1.5/5", "", "", "1/4", "", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "", "", "2/4", "", "2/4", "1/5", "2.5/4", "", "", "2/5", "", "2/4", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Leigh Paatsch", "Chris Peachment", "Joe Morgenstern", "Gene Siskel", "Rita Kempley", "Jeff Shannon", "Desmond Ryan", "Jay Boyar", "Richard Schickel", "Mark Caro", "Gary Susman", "Dennis King", "Jeff Strickler", "Chris Kridler", "Leah Rozen", "David Ansen", "Robin Karney", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Gary Thompson", "Rod Dreher"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Phoenix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Minneapolis Star Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel"], "date": ["October 19, 2020", "November 28, 2017", "June 18, 2014", "June 18, 2014", "June 18, 2014", "June 18, 2014", "June 18, 2014", "June 18, 2014", "June 18, 2014", "June 18, 2014", "June 18, 2014", "June 18, 2014", "June 18, 2014", "June 18, 2014", "June 18, 2014", "June 18, 2014", "June 18, 2014", "June 18, 2014", "June 18, 2014", "June 18, 2014"]}}
