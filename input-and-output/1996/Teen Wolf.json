{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When high school nerd Scott Howard (Michael J. Fox) learns from his father, Harold (James Hampton), that being a werewolf runs in the family, he decides to take advantage of his freakish trait. With his newfound strength and agility, Scott quickly becomes the hero of his school's basketball team while winning over longtime crush Pamela Wells (Lorie Griffin). As he grows more popular, Scott worries he is being celebrated as a novelty rather than for who he is.", "rating": "42", "genre": "Comedy/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Rod Daniel", "studio": "Wolfkill", "theater_date": "Aug 23, 1985", "dvd_date": "Aug 27, 2015", "box_office": "$32.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["To his credit, director Rod Daniel has crafted an amiable teen film and gets a pleasing performance from Fox in the title role.

The problem is that Teen Wolf doesn't know where to go from there.", "Rather than a wolf in sheep's clothing, Teen Wolf is basically a standard 80s teen flick in werewolf's clothing.", "It's often ridiculous, and filled with '80s cheese, but Teen Wolf does harbor some poignant coming-of-age metaphors and decent helping of intentional, and unintentional, comedy.", "Despite the inexcusable lack of a DeLorean, Teen Wolf is a modest, digestible comedy, guided by a perfectly itchy Fox performance as the titular beast.", "Lightweight item is innocuous and well-intentioned but terribly feeble, another example of a decent idea yielding the least imaginative results conceivable.", "corny but endearing", "", "", "", ""], "rating": ["", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "3/5", "", "2/4", "", "4/5", "", "2/4", "7/10", "B-", "", "3/5", "C", "3/5", "3/5", "1/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Duane Byrge", "Roger Hurlburt", "Rick Kogan", "Dave Kehr", "Octavi Marti", "Jason Caro", "People Staff", "TV Guide Staff", "Lloyd Grove", "Sky Staff", "Rick Chatenever", "Matt Brunson", "R.L.
