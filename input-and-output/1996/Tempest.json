{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A shipwreck casts members of a royal court ashore on a mysterious island. Their fateful arrival is no accident, for it was engineered by Prospera (Helen Mirren), a sorceress whom these men banished, and who now plans to take vengeance on them. With the help of Caliban and Ariel, her sometimes-unwilling aides, Prospera brings her powers to bear on her former tormentors. Then love casts a spell on her daughter and the king's son, and Prospera is powerless to intervene.", "rating": "30", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Julie Taymor", "studio": "Chartoff/Hendee,TalkStoryProductions", "theater_date": "Dec 10, 2010", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$263.4K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["... something about The Tempest just didn't work for me.

That's not a compliment.", "Dispensing with tableau compositions, this adaptation feels liberated from static theatrical and, to a lesser degree, cinematic convention by the overall openness of its staging and camerawork that's somewhere between handheld and Steadicam.", "", "", "", "There are two reasons to watch The Tempest: if you're a fan of Shakespeare, or a fan of Helen Mirren.", "Hundreds of years ago, Shakespeare would have never imagined this story could look like Taymor's vision.", "Taymor tries a little too hard, neither breaking nor broken by the play, but ultimately losing the wrestling match. [Blu-ray]", "Taymor excels at creating visuals that are so beautiful you want to hang every frame on your wall, but content-wise this film falls really flat.", "The film has plenty of detractors who see Taymor's approach as strained and overwrought, but Mirren finds some grace notes that no Prospero could ever have sounded.", "While this had the potential to be a stirring cinematic experience, director Julie Taymor's trademark innovation and visual flair never soars.", "", "Shakespeare is spinning in his grave.", "As a re-imagining, particularly by a director so well renowned, The Tempest is depressingly pedestrian.", "[M]essy but thrilling...
