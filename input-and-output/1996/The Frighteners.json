{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Once an architect, Frank Bannister (Michael J. Fox) now passes himself off as an exorcist of evil spirits. To bolster his facade, he claims his \"special\" gift is the result of a car accident that killed his wife. But what he does not count on is more people dying in the small town where he lives. As he tries to piece together the supernatural mystery of these killings, he falls in love with the wife (Trini Alvarado) of one of the victims and deals with a crazy FBI agent (Jeffrey Combs).", "rating": "64", "genre": "Comedy/Horror/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Peter Jackson", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 8, 2015", "box_office": "$16.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There's ultimately little doubt that The Frighteners is at its best in its briskly-paced and thoroughly entertaining first half...", "There's not a boring moment in the film and almost every single scene adds new layers to the film's multiple mysteries.", "[Michael J.] Fox seems to be trying to get hip in the movies, and he's lost his way here.", "Violent, frenzied, foul-mouthed ghost comedy.", "Story was originally conceived as an episode of \"Tales From the Crypt,\" and that is perhaps what it should have remained, as the thinness of the conceit shows throughout, painfully so in the first half.", "At times the relentless special effects and tangled plotting veer towards visual and narrative overkill, but the final tonal swerve is shocking and effective.", "Despite being awful in almost every respect, The Frighteners does offer one small pleasure: R.
