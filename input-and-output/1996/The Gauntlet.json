{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A cop who has seen better days, hard-living Ben Shockley (Clint Eastwood) is recruited to escort Augustina \"Gus\" Mally (Sondra Locke), a key witness in a mob trial, from Las Vegas to Phoenix. Gus is a beautiful but coarse call girl who claims to have information that makes the two highly expendable targets. Ben starts to believe her after numerous attempts are made to kill them as they travel across the unforgiving desert, pursued by angry bikers and corrupt police officers.", "rating": "75", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Clint Eastwood", "studio": "WarnerBros.,MalpasoCompany", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2009", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Eastwood... blurs the line between law enforcement and the way the Mob conducts its business to provide extra food for thought in a compelling and well-paced tale.", "The subject is the redemption of the pop hero, and Eastwood accomplishes his purgation with wit, intelligence, and a complete disregard for the prevailing standards of realism.", "There's too little action to let Eastwood show himself to advantage as the fine, stylized screen fighter he is. Instead, there's talk and psychology, which he can handle only by gritting his teeth.", "The Eastwood formula is predictable but fun; thin plot, lots of action and heroic stoicism above all.", "What happens then is so wild and improbable, though not at all exciting, that it can never compensate at its wildest for the sluggishness of the first half.", "Vicious and hypocritical as it is, \"The Gauntlet\" remains an entertaining sort of disreputable show, considerably more proficient and interesting than junk melodramas in a dogged vein...", "Hokum action pic.", "A crime picture in which Clint Eastwood departs quite effectively from his Dirty Harry character", "It's an absurdly violent tale, but the violence eventually reaches an almost avant-garde, visual dimension.", "A personal vision, as bold and outrageous as late-Peckinpah's, of Man versus the Cosmos", "...suffers from a pervasively muted atmosphere that effectively drains its more overtly thrilling interludes of their impact.", "In a major role reversal, Clint Eastwood stars in The Gauntlet as a person who might be on the receiving end of the violence epitomized in his famed Dirty Harry film series.", "Contrived to the point of ridiculous, but still bizarre enough Eastwood to watch.", "Eastwood good, Locke bad.
