{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the Southwest during the Civil War, a mysterious stranger, Joe (Clint Eastwood), and a Mexican outlaw, Tuco (Eli Wallach), form an uneasy partnership -- Joe turns in the bandit for the reward money, then rescues him just as he is being hanged. When Joe's shot at the noose goes awry during one escapade, a furious Tuco tries to have him murdered. The men re-team abruptly, however, to beat out a sadistic criminal and the Union army and find $20,000 that a soldier has buried in the desert.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Western", "runtime": "2h 41m", "director": "Sergio Leone", "studio": "ProduzioniEuropeeAssociati,ConstantinFilm", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 27, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Leone's penchant for contrasting two kinds of shots, close-ups and long shots, finds its corollary in the gray or blue...Leone turns gray soldiers blue in the simplest way possible.

Those who love Sergio Leone's The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966) and those who resist the machismo and gallows humor of what is arguably the definitive spaghetti western.", "Leone's liberal use of widescreen shots in conjunction with extreme close-ups gives the movie an epic quality that is matched in scope by a skeletal narrative structure that breathes with a poker-faced mood, tone, and personality.", "A unique vision of the American West as place of desolation and ruin on a truly epic scale.", "The defining spaghetti western pits a charismatic Clint Eastwood against partner and nemesis Eli Wallach and perpetual enemy Lee Van Cleef.", "Potent Italian-Western shoot-'em up/war drama.", "Its parody of genre conventions resonates with scope and power.", "Sergio Leone's dramatic directing style is powerful and well delivered, even by today's standards.", "The fellas in Leone's films are seething cesspools of hatred and frustration whose only satisfaction-however fleeting-is found in pursuit and acquisition of money", "The sublime film music, now-iconic situations (like the climactic ghost town shootout), and sure visual style add up to a pitch-perfect genre pic that ongoingly influences generations of hip filmmakers.
