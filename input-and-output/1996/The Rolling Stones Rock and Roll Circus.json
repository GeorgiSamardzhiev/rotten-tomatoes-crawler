{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This film documents a 1968 performance from rock legends the Rolling Stones, the Who, John Lennon, Eric Clapton and others. Mick Jagger's girlfriend, folkie Marianne Faithfull, also sings. The unconventional concert takes place in a carnival-like setting, and the musicians don outlandish apparel to match the garish backdrop. Jagger acts as the ringmaster and introduces the bands, and a collaborative blues set by Lennon, Clapton and Stones guitarist Keith Richards is also featured.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Documentary/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 5m", "director": "Michael Lindsay-Hogg", "studio": "Gochanour/Klein", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 17, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An incredible timepiece concert film that's a window into the rock scene of the 1960s.", "Spiffily restored and bursting at the seams with extra features.
