{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Heroic World War I pilot Roger Shumann (Robert Stack) is all but forgotten by the 1930s, but flying is all he knows, so he takes work as an air show stuntman. Roger's job is demeaning, low-paying and dangerous. Perpetually frustrated, he takes his anger out on his gorgeous wife, LaVerne (Dorothy Malone). Journalist Burke Devlin (Rock Hudson) chances upon the once-great pilot at one of his shows and becomes fascinated by Roger's undying devotion to flight -- and by the alluring LaVerne.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "1h 27m", "director": "Douglas Sirk", "studio": "UniversalInternationalPictures", "theater_date": "Jan 11, 1958", "dvd_date": "Apr 22, 2011", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Sirk's film is easily one of the earlier examples of a film that committed itself to such a stark and authentic presentation.", "The Tarnished Angels also retains its Faulkneresque signature of three damaged souls who feed off one another's misery, and it's an interesting leap from his more famous barn burning for the archaic sport of barnstorming.", "As a purely physical spectacle, the movie is worth anyone's time... that style was substance, or rather that style was philosophy, and he conveys emotions through this mise-en-sc\u00e8ne as substantially as through acting, dialogue or plot.", "Sirk, known for his rich use of colors, opted to employ black-and-white for The Tarnished Angels -- it was a sound and strategic choice, further amplifying the overcast quality that permeates these characters' lives.", "An unsung masterpiece.", "One of Douglas Sirk's masterworks.", "Sirk mines sombre poetry from these lives, though a tacked-on happy-ish ending lets him down.", "Given limited budget and technology, the airplane races are well staged over a short oval course around the striped pylons.", "An enduring philosophical strain of proto-feminist endurance in a land that's both made and menaced by its intrepid warriors.", "Set in the Depression era, this tale of daredevils doing air showsand their nomad lifestyle is one of cult director Douglas Sirk's very best films, and also the finest screen adaptation of a William Faulkner novel.", "A seething melodrama about a family of daredevil pilots."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "3.5/5", "", "3/4", "4/4", "", "4/5", "", "", "A", "A"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Nicholas Bell", "Michael Barrett", "Matt Brunson", "Jeffrey M.
