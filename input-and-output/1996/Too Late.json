What's less convincing is why this film matters.", "It's all so random and cheeky that it's a type of perverse fun.", "This thing is mildly tasty, but no one will say it's organic.", "It might get a little smug and a wee bit pretentious, but Too Late is never less than impressive.", "The longer Too Late goes on, the less there is to it.", "With its self-conscious lighting, long zooms and tight focus, Bill Fernandez' old-fashioned photography superbly captures both the seedy and faux-glamorous vistas of LA.", "A stylized blend of classic film noir and New Hollywood pulp, this remarkable debut feature may grate on mainstream viewers with its affected drama and offbeat pacing, but cinephiles will be charmed.", "This is an indulgent exercise from a young filmmaker who shows loads of promise, way too much style, and not enough script.", "Almost any scene with Hawkes is alive and satisfyingly showy. You feel his absence when he isn't there, though Joanna Cassidy, Crystal Reed and Robert Forster all have their moments.", "The puzzle pieces of Hauck's brain-teaser don't always come together perfectly, but there's no denying it's infectious fun.", "a breathtakingly assured piece of storytelling done with visual poetry and haunting emotional resonance", "May be the best straightforward California-noir since Robert Altman's The Player.", "While it can be frustrating to see some filmmakers dash off copies of other movies, it's deeply enjoyable to find one who so appreciates his inspirations.", "The hyperverbal screenplay quickly grows tiresome, from the sub-\"Pulp Fiction\" prattle of two drug dealers (Dash Mihok and Rider Strong) to one act after another in which desperate women are preyed upon or saved by the men around them.", "A supremely self-conscious genre exercise in which character and emotional depth don't seem to be on the very meta menu.", "All the narrative hopscotching is little more than a superficial ploy to gussy up a clich\u00e9d redemption tale."], "rating": ["4/5", "", "", "3/4", "2.5/4", "", "", "7/10", "1/5", "2.5/4", "", "2.5/5", "2.5/4", "", "5/5", "", "", "2/4", "", "1/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Sian Brett", "Kathy Fennessy", "Matt Shiverdecker", "Sean P.
