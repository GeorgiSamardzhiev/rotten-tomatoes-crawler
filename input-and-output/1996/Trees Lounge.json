The best thing in his life is a lukewarm romance with cool local girl Debbie (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny), who, unfortunately, is Theresa's underage niece.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 34m", "director": "Steve Buscemi", "studio": "LiveEntertainment,MuseProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$673.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "An impressive feature debut from indie icon Buscemi, a serio-comedy and character study of a barfly (played by Buscemi) and the entourage that frequents the same working bar day after day; John Cassavetes would have been proud of this film.", "", "Not nearly as interesting as Buscemi's body of work in front of the camera.", "", "", "a hard-nosed downer of a bender", "An engaging character study.", "", "Better-than-solid directorial debut from Buscemi.", "", "", "", "Buscemi does a fine job directing this sad, realistic, sometimes humorous look into the life of an alcoholic.", "", "at least Buscemi doesn't let the self-pity get too thick", "", "Steve Buscemi, who plays Tommy and also wrote and directed the film, knows about alcoholism from the inside out and backward, and his movie is the most accurate portrait of the daily saloon drinker I have ever seen.", "", ""], "rating": ["A", "B+", "3/5", "2.5/4", "3/5", "B-", "4/5", "B", "3/5", "4/5", "6/10", "4/4", "2/5", "4/5", "3/5", "3.5/5", "4/5", "3.5/4", "3/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Owen Gleiberman", "Emanuel Levy", "Cole Smithey", "Michael Dequina", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "Robin Clifford", "Eric Melin", "Dennis Schwartz", "Spence D.", "Alex Sandell", "Dragan Antulov", "Leonard Schwarz", "Jeffrey Westhoff", "Larry Carroll", "Rob Vaux", "Christopher Null", "", "Roger Ebert", "Oz", "Susan Stark"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieReport.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fantastica Daily", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reeling Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lawrence.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IGN Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Juicy Cerebellum", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rec.arts.movies.reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Palo Alto Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Northwest Herald (Crystal Lake, IL)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Countingdown.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flipside Movie Emporium", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmcritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">BBC.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Sun-Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Detroit News"], "date": ["September 7, 2011", "January 8, 2007", "November 14, 2005", "September 14, 2005", "August 31, 2005", "April 9, 2005", "March 8, 2005", "March 27, 2004", "February 10, 2004", "October 23, 2003", "June 24, 2003", "May 20, 2003", "March 27, 2003", "September 27, 2002", "August 10, 2002", "April 28, 2001", "April 17, 2001", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000"]}}
