It drags and drags.", "Hitchcock's finest film.", "Even such a master-craftsman as director Alfred Hitchcock sometimes forgets that more than enough is too much, as he proves in this photogenic San Francisco suspense-mystery, which is still badly in need of the cutter's shears.", "We can appreciate [Hitchcock's] films... and yet still acknowledge that their female characters were not created by a very well-adjusted, progressivethinking man.", "The greatest of all time.", "Audiences and critics in 1958 were not prepared to deal with the kind of twisted darkness Vertigo presents so clearly ... but hopefully we're all grown up now and able to deal with it.", "A film totally in thrall to the lure/peril of looking, and filmed almost entirely from the perspective or emotion of the subconscious.", "It's doubtful that Vertigo can take equal rank with the best of the Hitchcock studies -- it has too many holes -- but it assays high in visual confectionary of place, person and celluloid wiles.", "Combines in an almost unique balance Hitchcock's brash flair for psychological shocks with his elegant genius for dapper stylishness.", "A dizzying cinematic experience.", "Hitchcock's film is distinctive, above all else, because it is the only one in his long catalogue without a scornful mask separating the obsessions from the vulnerabilities, and into the frames he pours the living essence of his timeless panache.", "The tempo may be generally very slow, but it is not monotonous; the camera work may be unostentatious but it is quietly, calmly efficient in establishing character, atmosphere, and uncertainty.", "At the risk of sounding slow-witted, I must complain that Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo was a little too difficult for me.", "Alfred Hitchcock's \"Vertigo\" is an artistic triumph for the master of mystery.", "The best film in the history of cinema.
