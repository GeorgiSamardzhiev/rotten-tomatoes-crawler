{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1960, a hardy group of prep school students boards an old-fashioned sailing ship. With Capt. Christopher Sheldon (Jeff Bridges) at the helm, the oceangoing voyage is intended to teach the boys fortitude and discipline. But the youthful crew -- among them confident Chuck Gieg (Scott Wolf), timid Gil Martin (Ryan Phillippe) and self-satisfied Frank Beaumont (Jeremy Sisto) -- are about to get some unexpected instruction in survival when they get caught in the clutches of a white squall storm.", "rating": "58", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "2h 7m", "director": "Ridley Scott", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 18, 2016", "box_office": "$10.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Bridges does his best to command the emotional resonance we assume motivated Sheldon, but scant characterization marks him merely as a cipher for brawny, brain-washed ideations of what masculinity's supposed to look like.", "Though lavishly produced and based on a true story, it still fails to satisfy.", "The filmmakers take a rather facile, anachronistic \"Oprah\"-esque approach toward the boys' feelings about their families and the Skipper's role as a \"tough love\"-minded surrogate father.", "This particular landlubber felt like jelly for the rest of the day, notwithstanding the hokey courtroom showdown that closes the picture.", "An old-fashioned, white-knuckle adventure with the excellent Bridges adding another great characterization to his increasingly impressive resume.", "", "Bridges puts his shoulder to the wheel and impresses audiences.", "An Excellent Picture. It doesn't get any better", "", "", "Stunning ocean visuals and a gut-wrenching storm sequence. An underrated and very good coming of age story.", "Despite great scenery, the distinctive visual ideas of Mr. Scott (Alien, Blade Runner) and the strong dramatic presence of Mr. Bridges, most of White Squall remains listless and tame.", "Dead Poets Society goes to the high seas in this overly ambitious tale of 13 young men aboard a floating prep school vessel. Their rite of passage is the core element in this all-spit and no-polish production.", "", "Unengaging maritime thriller from Ridley Scott. Good cast, but fails to connect.", "This is a very solid film with strong acting performances to boost it, excellent photography and a good soundtrack.", "", "Daring and dramatic film about the passage of a group of young boys who come of age during their adventures at sea.", "If the focus had been on the characters' experiences instead of the white squall, much more of the movie would have made a lasting impression.", "Typically, Bridges gives a deftly understated performance uncluttered by vanity or shallow pathos.
