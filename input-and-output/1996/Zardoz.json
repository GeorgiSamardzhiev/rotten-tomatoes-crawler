{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the future, Earth is ruled by Eternals, an advanced and secret sect of beings who reign over a savage group called Brutals. The Eternals have created a god named Zardoz to intimidate the Brutals, making them believe that killing is their natural state. However, Zed (Sean Connery), a Brutal warrior, challenges that assumption when he enters the Zardoz monument and is captured by an Eternal (Charlotte Rampling). There, he learns the truth about the Eternals and the false god that rules society.", "rating": "47", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "John Boorman", "studio": "JohnBoormanProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 1, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A sci-fi curio...a more gonzo version of Logan's Run - with Connery in thigh-high boots and a \"Borat\"-esque G-string - as a futuristic savage turned enforcer by the elites in power...", "The plot is so spectacularly offbeat that it's never boring, though it's routinely idiotic.", "It has that homemade, backyard look we encounter so frequently in low-budget films. This is particularly damaging to a work that tries to compete with such superproductions as 2001 and A Clockwork Orange.", "For me, it achieves something that 2001, with all its light shows and gimmicks, did not, a satisfactory conclusion.", "[Zardoz] demonstrates how one can make a cheap sci-fi flick look like a cheap sci-fi flick by using mirrors and prisms as substitutes for imagination.", "... pretentious sludge with some memorable visuals.", "You have to hand it to John Boorman. When he's brilliant, he's brilliant (Point Blank, Deliverance) but when he's terrible, he's really terrible.", "Boorman's finest film is a wonderfully eccentric and visually exciting sci-fi quest.", "Probably John Boorman's most underrated film-an impossibly ambitious and pretentious but also highly inventive, provocative, and visually striking SF adventure.", "\"There's less to this than meets the eye.\"", "Whatever your verdict, you'll agree that Sean Connery compels attention...", "Such a wildly ambitious misfire that you can't help but root for it, or at least feel some twisted sense of affection for it.", "Weird, fatuous and tedious fantasy futuristic sci-fi cult film.", "While it can't hope to achieve its grand ambitions, it's smart, it has some sharp dialogue, and the surrealism-on-a-shoestring visuals are undeniably striking.", "Zardoz is a futuristic, metaphysical and anthropological drama testing John Boorman in three creative areas. The results: direction, good; script, a brilliant premise which unfortunately washes out in climactic sound and fury; and production, outstanding.", "", "Pretty contrived sci-fi with leathery Sean Connery.", "", "The script gradually falls apart into a mess of philosophical pottage under the whimsically pretentious Tolkien influence.
