{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Gwen Moss (Jeanne Tripplehorn), a writer hired to pen a book about former child star Francesca Lanfield (Sarah Jessica Parker), moves to the apartment complex that the actress owns.

Eventually, Gwen and Nick meet, and there's an undeniable chemistry, despite their differences.", "rating": "5", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Scott Winant", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$3.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["I had mixed feelings about the slow ride, but one thing is certain: This film could have been a lot stronger if it was a lot simpler.", "It tries for fizzy, but there's hardly a bubble in it.", "When will someone realize that sexy Sarah Jessica Parker is pure comic gold and start writing movies that give her a chance to glisten? She's the only spice in this too-sweet romantic comedy.", "Very little is amusing in all of this; the lighting is murky, the sound is mumbly, and will someone please tell the piano player to knock it off?", "Alas, first-time director Scott Winant and screenwriter Winnie Holzman rarely get beyond the cuteness of the story's structure.", "Its stars, young, sexy performers all, deserve a better vehicle.", "I was not surprised to discover in the press notes that the movie ''has a touch of autobiography.'' The film's irritating insistence on parading its sensitivity gave the game away.", "The woeful miscasting of Jeanne Tripplehorn sabotages this romantic comedy about two people who are destined to meet but who contrive to keep missing each other.", "Coincidence follows coincidence as the story moves predictably toward its pre-determined ending. But not before Winant and Holzman parade an annoying array of thinly drawn eccentrics and weirdos across the screen by way of fleshing things out.", "Sometimes funny but often plodding.", "'Til There Was You is a rarity -- a film in which absolutely nothing works. Nothing. Not one redeeming performance. Not one convincing moment. Not one solid laugh.", "Bad romantic comedies with sappy characters aren't always without merit, since we cynics can at least use them to further our conviction that love isn't worth the trouble. But this bad romantic comedy is merely bad.", "Graceless star Tripplehorn -- who's called upon to execute a painful series of pratfalls in a high-tech restaurant -- is not a natural comedian, and overall the movie is awkward and leaden.", "With its clotted script, art direction that's all splash and no style, and dialogue that's too nakedly calculated to facilitate identification), this tedious and confused movie points several characters in obvious directions.", "A tired piece of romantic cornball fare that harks back to a bygone era, the film is a badly conceived, poorly executed fairy tale guaranteed to make audiences squirm in their seats.", "", "The film's real irony is that Gwen and Nick are so annoying that they deserve each other.", "", "", "The end credits couldn't have come any sooner"], "rating": ["2.5/4", "2/4", "", "1/4", "2/4", "", "1/5", "2/5", "1/4", "2/4", "", "", "2/4", "", "", "2/5", "2/4", "3/5", "2/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["John Petrakis", "Jami Bernard", "Peter Travers", "Michael Ollove", "John Hartl", "Leah Rozen", "Jay Boyar", "Jo Berry", "Dennis King", "Jean Hacklander", "Robert W.
