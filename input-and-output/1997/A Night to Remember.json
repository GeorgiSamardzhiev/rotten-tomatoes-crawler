{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The sinking of the Titanic is presented in a highly realistic fashion in this tense British drama. The disaster is portrayed largely from the perspective of the ocean liner's second officer, Charles Lightoller (Kenneth More). Despite numerous warnings about ice, the ship sails on, with Capt. Edward John Smith (Laurence Naismith) keeping it going at a steady clip. When the doomed vessel finally hits an iceberg, the crew and passengers discover that they lack enough lifeboats, and tragedy follows.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Drama/Special Interest", "runtime": "2h 3m", "director": "Roy Ward Baker", "studio": "RankFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 23, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["[A Night to Remember] is a motion picture that will long be remembered for the manner in which it has dramatized cold fact, and given the suspense and the excitement usually engendered only by fiction.", "While the special effects may not hold a candle to the Academy Award winning work in Cameron's film, they're still quite impressive given the period, and Baker manages to infuse the film with an unflagging sense of authenticity.", "1950s British take on Titanic tragedy is a masterpiece.", "(We have) stood witness to a spectacular tragedy that took place on a perfectly unspectacular, dead calm night", "Kenneth More essays the central role of Second Officer Charles Herbert Lightoller, and he's the reassuring presence throughout a film that breaks down the incident in powerful fashion.", "", "A restrained, nearly austere ensemble drama that manages to intertwine a dozen different stories without tripping up on any of them, it relies on real-life survivor testimony for almost every line and incident, to immensely moving and dignified effect.", "A film with a documentary-like intensity and a sense of British reserve that makes it all the more moving.", "Cold and brutal - exactly how this tale should be told.", "Baker cuts to the chase - the iceberg strikes 30 minutes in - and maintains tension with consummate skill: not an easy task when the outcome is already known.", "a film that broke new ground in depicting one of history's worst maritime disasters, interweaving historical reality with a dexterous sense of storytelling that keeps the film fresh and engaging so many decades later", "Forget about Kate and Leo in 3D, the best Titanic movie, like the ship itself, is Belfast built by a legendary Irish filmmaker.", "The clearest, most honorable cinematic depiction of the Titanic disaster&#8230; a classy depiction of how human beings in 1912 faced life and death in the fabled tragedy.", "", "", "Model suspense and, compared with Titanic, a model of efficiency too.", "", "", "While a little on the dry side, it's easily the most accurate film on the subject.", "Richer, more human and more satisfying than Titanic."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "5/5", "8/10", "3.5/4", "4.5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "5/5", "3.5/4", "9/10", "A-", "4/5", "3/5", "5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4.5/5", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["George Bourke", "Matthew Lucas", "Brian Costello", "Christopher Long", "Matt Brunson", "Jennie Kermode", "Catherine Shoard", "Allan Hunter", "David Jenkins", "Tom Huddleston", "James Kendrick", "Brian Henry Martin", "Steven D.
