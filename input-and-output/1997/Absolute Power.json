There isn't even a single character in the movie under 30.", "An ingenious, taut thriller beset with narrative gaps and unconvincing moments.", "\"Absolute Power\" is not a \"must-see.\" But if you're looking for a well-made, grown-up movie, it's worth your time and money.", "Absolute Power is one of those evil-in-high-places thrillers that hums along nicely while the crimes are being committed, and sputters while they're being solved.", "It's more effective than expected - aside from the scenes of excessive sex and violence, that is - mainly because Eastwood gives one of the most deeply felt performances of his career.", "\"Absolute Power\" wanders. Yet, the movie is worth seeing simply because of Eastwood's presence, his (and Green's) camera, his excellent cast.", "It's let down by a wildly implausible script... but it's still enjoyable, and the sleaze theme is nothing if not timely.", "Eastwood has infused Absolute Power with a predictably deliberate sensibility that fits the material quite well...", "Eastwood is at his effortless, slyboots best: he deftly cranks up the suspense at the beginning, but by the end he's cruising along so briskly that he can afford to throw away the climactic, violent scenes other directors would belabor.", "A reasonably engrossing and entertaining suspenser for most of its running time that is undercut by too many coincidences and some whoppingly far-fetched developments in the home stretch.", "...Eastwood makes what he can of a nifty, though implausible, what-if idea.", "Eastwood films with his usual effortless pace, generating suspense practically out of thin air.", "Frequently fun, but glossy tosh.", "The plot is a doomsday version of Bill Clinton's Paula Jones problem, but the theme is impending mortality--settling scores before time's up.", "One begins to long for a good explosion.", "Not one of Clint's best, but still better-than-average entertainment."], "rating": ["", "", "", "3/5", "", "2.5/4", "", "B-", "", "3/4", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "6/10", "", "3/5", "", "2.5/4", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Rita Kempley", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Peter Travers", "Tom Hutchinson", "Chris Hewitt", "Malcolm Johnson", "Carol Buckland", "Steve Persall", "David Sterritt", "Michael Wilmington", "Total Film Staff", "David Nusair", "David Ansen", "Todd McCarthy", "John J.
