{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1839, the slave ship Amistad set sail from Cuba to America. During the long trip, Cinque (Djimon Hounsou) leads the slaves in an unprecedented uprising. They are then held prisoner in Connecticut, and their release becomes the subject of heated debate. Freed slave Theodore Joadson (Morgan Freeman) wants Cinque and the others exonerated and recruits property lawyer Roger Baldwin (Matthew McConaughey) to help his case. Eventually, John Quincy Adams (Anthony Hopkins) also becomes an ally.", "rating": "77", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 32m", "director": "Steven Spielberg", "studio": "DreamWorksSKG,HomeBoxOffice(HBO)", "theater_date": "Dec 10, 1997", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Amistad is certainly a film of considerable power.", "Amistad is worth seeing for the stormy scenes on board the slave boat, and for Djimon Hounsou's magnetic performance. Otherwise, it can't decide on its direction, and this unique historical event is stifled into a less than thrilling courtroom drama.", "The narrative perils are daunting in this little-known true tale of a bloody slave-ship rebellion in 1839 and its jumbled aftermath in the U.S. judicial system.", "'Amistad' may not be the first, or fifth, or tenth film people talk about when Spielberg's name comes up. But it has more moments that will put your hair on end than other filmmakers' best works, and that says something.", "", "Powerful story for mid-teens and up.", "In short, a wordy courtroom drama which seldom progresses beyond ciphers, stereotypes and salutary slogans.", "Amistad is worth seeing just for people to know about this important story, this moment in history. But from the world's most powerful, successful and famous director, we expect more.", "Aiming to instruct and entertain, and often struggling to reconcile these goals, Amistad lacks the subtlety of tone and simplicity of form that made Schindler's List one of Spielberg's very best; here, however, every idea and image are too explicit.", "Fortunately, the dry, courtroom banter is interjected with powerful accounts of the violent, inhumane atrocities inflicted on the slaves by Spanish merchants.", "Amistad is the telling of an interesting event in American history, but doesn't draw its audience in to the heart of the story.", "This is the most straightforward, understated, and powerful big-screen representation of the gospel in recent movie history. And for that, Amistad should be recommended to everyone.", "", "As with Schindler&#8217;s List, Spielberg allows his subjects to be remote and somewhat unknowable human beings, creating an air of documentary-like authenticity.", "Amistad is the kind of movie that makes a tired topic seem fresh and entertaining again.", "", "Just when you thought you had seen the best movie there is about a historic seagoing vessel, along comes Amistad.", "Spielberg's films never lack a certain degree of narrative and visual force, but his tendency toward sentimentality, a strictly antipodal, Good-vs.-Bad conception of character, and an insensitivity to structure have consistently marred his work...", "", "Steven Spielberg's engaging, heartfelt and well-made drama delves into a critical incident in the history of slavery in America."], "rating": ["", "3/5", "3.5/4", "", "C", "4/5", "", "3/4", "3/4", "3/5", "B+", "B", "5/10", "B+", "B+", "3.5/4", "5/5", "B", "3/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Eric L.
