{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Filmmaker Terri Flores (Jennifer Lopez) is traveling deep in the Amazon jungle looking for a forgotten tribe. Terri and her crew, which includes an anthropologist (Eric Stoltz) and a cameraman (Ice Cube), come across Paul (Jon Voight), who is stranded on the riverbank. He offers to help them find the tribe, but his secretive behavior puts everyone on edge. They realize too late that he's using them to find a legendary anaconda that's worth a fortune -- if they can catch it.", "rating": "38", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 29m", "director": "Luis Llosa", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$65.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One of those horror films that intends to be serious, scary, and bloody, but turns out laughably hokey.", "One of the highlights of... the last Golden Age of so-bad-it's-good cinema.", "Yet somehow, Anaconda racks up a winning score (and body count) with a mix of imagination and humour.", "The monster looks like a maniacal garden hose in a couple of sequences. Still, it delivers the necessary thrills and chills.", "", "An above average specimen hungering for tasty morsels.", "Just to show, early on, how much danger these folks are in, we get to see the film's titular star squeeze a black panther so tight that one of its eyeballs pops out.", "Anaconda, directed by Luis Llosa with all of the subtlety of a snake-oil salesman, is in the great tradition of cinematic cheese, as processed as Kraft Singles slices.", "In its natural habitat, Anaconda can be appreciated for its campy pleasures, not the least of which is Jon Voight in a delirious, balls-out performance as creepy Paraguayan snake poacher Paul Serone.

But more often, it derives laughs unintentionally.", "Done with such a wry sense of humor - thanks, especially, to an over-the-top, hopefully intentional, outrageous performance by Jon Voight, and some nifty snake effects - that you forgive its derivative nature and settle down for some fun.", "Anaconda suffers from one-dimensional characters and cliches.", "", "Both Ice Cube and Voigt are fun to watch in the film.
