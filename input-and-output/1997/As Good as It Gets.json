{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Melvin Udall (Jack Nicholson) is an obsessive-compulsive writer of romantic fiction who's rude to everyone he meets, including his gay neighbor Simon (Greg Kinnear), but when he has to look after Simon's dog, he begins to soften and, if still not completely over his problems, finds he can conduct a relationship with the only waitress (Helen Hunt) at the local diner who'll serve him.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 18m", "director": "James L.

Brooks and co-writer Mark Andrus elevate it with terrific writing.", "On one hand, it's Brooks's film that most betrays his TV sitcom roots; it's also one of his more ambitious works, packing in subplots and subjects by the handful-indicative of a filmmaker who seems to genuinely struggle with the confines of the genre.", "Funny, but not a light comedy for youngsters.", "The greatest pleasures come from the acting.", "The movie's too long, and the direction is sometimes slack -- but the script is crammed with withering ripostes, ably delivered by Nicholson and Hunt.", "A sporadically funny romantic comedy with all the dramatic plausibility and tonal consistency of a TV variety show.", "Not only one of the best romantic comedies of the year, but one of the best films in ages.", "The trouble lies in the rambling narrative, Brooks' cautious direction and the cosy tone which renders the whole thing reminiscent of an extended sitcom.", "Both funny and sad, the comedy was in the vein of Brooks' Terms of Endearment, except it was more eccentric and nuttier and in moments genuinely touching due to strong chemistry between Jack Nicholson and Helen Hunt.", "An inflated TV show by a sitcom creator.", "The character is written as the most unlikable person one could ever meet. Despite this fact, Jack manages to make the character sympathetic.", "The unpredictable and fresh 'As Good As It Gets' is peppered with memorable Brooks lines and physical schtick.", "Mildly likable.", "...a precariously balanced movie, one that flirts with smugness. That it isn't awful is in some respects amazing.", "... it coaxes us to be more open to each other, more compassionate, and more loving.", "Like Broadcast News, James L. Brooks' new film is a dark-edged adult comedy that hits the spot for those who like their romances splashed with acidic wit.", "Even the familiar scenes and situations look refreshing.", "", "Humorous, romantic, personal."], "rating": ["", "", "", "4/5", "3/4", "2.5/4", "", "3.5/4", "", "B-", "0/5", "3.5/5", "A+", "B-", "B+", "B", "3.5/4", "7/10", "3/4", "4.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Duane Byrge", "Anupama Chopra", "Jason Bailey", "Kelly Kessler", "Michael Dequina", "Sandra Contreras", "Todd McCarthy", "Garth Franklin", "Geoff Andrew", "Emanuel Levy", "Jake Euker", "Anthony Miele", "Steve Crum", "Robin Clifford", "Philip Martin", "Jeffrey Overstreet", "Judith Egerton", "Dragan Antulov", "Leonard Schwarz", "John R.
