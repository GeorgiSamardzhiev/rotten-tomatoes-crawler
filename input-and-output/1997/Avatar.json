Because the planet's environment is poisonous, human/Na'vi hybrids, called Avatars, must link to human minds to allow for free movement on Pandora. Jake Sully (Sam Worthington), a paralyzed former Marine, becomes mobile again through one such Avatar and falls in love with a Na'vi woman (Zoe Saldana). As a bond with her grows, he is drawn into a battle for the survival of her world.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 35m", "director": "James Cameron", "studio": "Dune,LightstormEntertainment,IngeniousFilmPartners", "theater_date": "Dec 18, 2009", "dvd_date": "Feb 10, 2016", "box_office": "$760.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The level of detail and creativity surrounding the look of director James Cameron's new world is simply astonishing.", "Avatar is very nearly devoid of that spark of humanity that would allow the film to soar.", "...as a member of the audience, I am happy enough to spend an afternoon communing with a society of blue creatures that look nothing like me.", "This is the evolution of entertainment.

[Full Review in Spanish]", "This movie is for anyone who wants to go on a journey far, far away. [Full Review in Spanish]", "With Avatar, James Cameron once again revolutionizes how we make and watch cinema. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Watching the movie was eye popping without being eye aching, and as immersive an experience as Cameron has been promising.", "Avatar is a reminder that the same sins that plagued our ancestors still live with us today.", "Rewatching it with fresh eyes 10 years later, the movie's pluses and minuses both rise into much starker relief. The verdict: It's...fine.", "[O]nce you delve beneath the groundbreaking effects and amazing visuals, Avatar is pretty standard fare.", "Avatar entertained me for nearly three hours and I left the theatre satisfied, even if my critic spidey-sense tingled at some of the clich\u00e9s and formulaic filmisms.", "Delivers on a grand scale something wonderful and timeless, an old-fashioned adventure told with seamless groundbreaking technology", "The digital world of Pandora is spellbinding.

Eh, it was all right...", "It's one of the most vivid, visceral movies you've ever seen. It's cheesy enough for ten Swiss villages.
