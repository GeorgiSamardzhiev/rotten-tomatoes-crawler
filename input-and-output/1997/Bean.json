{"metadata": {"synopsis": "At the Royal National Gallery in London, the bumbling Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson) is a guard with good intentions who always seems to destroy anything he touches. Unless, of course, he's sleeping on the job. With the chairman (John Mills) blocking Bean's firing, the board decides to send him to a Los Angeles art gallery under false credentials. When Bean arrives, his chaos-causing ways are as sharp as ever, and curator David Langley (Peter MacNicol) has the unenviable task of keeping Bean in line.", "rating": "44", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Mel Smith", "studio": "PolyGramFilmedEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 10, 2015", "box_office": "$45.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Atkinson isn't afraid to use a few of his best skits from the original show in this theatrical venture, but he adds enough new elements to be thoroughly fresh.", "How many English language films can say, \"To hell with America!\"?
