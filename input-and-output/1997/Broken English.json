{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Nora Wilder (Parker Posey), a single woman, is heading deep into the doldrums as a result of disappointments in her professional and personal lives.

But almost nothing that's said or done here is convincing. And the energy is set at near-coma level.", "Filmmaking is a family affair for the Cassavetes, and Zoe inherits the unpretentious, performance-driven style from her father, John, while delivering a love story that's accessible enough for mainstream audiences, a trick learned from her brother Nick.", "Zoe Cassavetes' new film Broken English is a delight, and as a debut film shows that we can expect good things from her.", "Cassavetes supplies no easy answers or easy laughs, forgoing romantic-comedy beats in respect for Nora's desperation. Call this confection a romantic-dramedy with humor on wry.", "It's pretty clear where this is going from the first frame, though Posey's performance does keep you interested.", "Broken English establishes a sympathetic character, gets Parker Posey to make her real, and then grinds her in the gears of a plot we cannot believe."], "rating": ["4/5", "8/10", "", "", "3.5/5", "2/5", "3/5", "", "3/4", "3/5", "2.5/5", "2/5", "8", "", "C", "3.5/4", "A", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Jenny Peters", "Heather Huntington", "Andrea Gronvall", "Brandon Judell", "Cherryl Dawson and Leigh Ann Palone", "Don Willmott", "S.
