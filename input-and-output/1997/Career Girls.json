They bonded in school, despite their differences; now they've become more mature and put their old problems behind them -- or so they think. Once they reunite, Annie realizes that she hasn't fully overcome her past anxieties, while Hannah learns that she is still too insensitive to the feelings of others. Both women hope to some make changes.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 27m", "director": "Mike Leigh", "studio": "Channel4TelevisionCorporation,ChannelFourFilms,MatrixFilms,ThinManFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 6, 2005", "box_office": "$2.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "It manages to be uninteresting, slight and bleak, while desperately trying to find something to say about the human condition.", "", "", "More modest and less involving than Secrets & Lies.", "Writer/director Mike Leigh has once again assembled an amazing cast to render a spectrum of human emotions beyond the range of most filmmakers' reach.", "A minor work from Mike Leigh, but its simple offhandedness is also its charm.", "", "", "", "", "develops into an insightful meditation on the nature of friendship, as well as a peek into the psyches of two people who think they've dealt with the past but have actually only pushed it aside.", "A convincing drama about two friends who try to keep their friendship together despite all the obstacles.", "Not every gift of value comes in fancy packaging.", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "rating": ["B+", "C", "3/5", "3/5", "2.5/4", "5/5", "3/5", "2/4", "4/5", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "3/4", "4/4", "4/5", "7/10", "2/4", "7/10", "6/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Dennis Schwartz", "Emanuel Levy", "Philip Martin", "Judith Egerton", "Christine James", "Nick Davis", "Susan Tavernetti", "Josh Ralske", "Michael Drakulich", "", "James Sanford", "Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat", "Andrew Howe", "Susan Stark", "Robert Faires", "Matt Easterbrook", "Rob Blackwelder", "Jack Garner", "Scott Renshaw"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Courier-Journal (Louisville, KY)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boxoffice Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Nick&#39;s Flick Picks", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Palo Alto Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">All Movie Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Star Newspapers (Chicago, IL)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Globe and Mail", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">James Sanford on Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spirituality &amp; Practice", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Written Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Detroit News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Austin Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Matt&#39;s Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">SPLICEDWire", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rochester Democrat and Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rec.arts.movies.reviews"], "date": ["September 7, 2011", "May 6, 2006", "June 18, 2005", "May 20, 2005", "July 6, 2004", "April 9, 2004", "August 14, 2003", "May 20, 2003", "February 8, 2003", "December 11, 2002", "July 12, 2002", "June 23, 2002", "February 27, 2002", "April 2, 2001", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000"]}}
