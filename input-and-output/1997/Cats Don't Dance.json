His only problem is that he's a cat and he can't understand why he's only getting parts playing an animal.

There are plenty of clever asides and witty one-liners, not to mention a few terrific supporting characters.", "Very cute animation with Randy Newman music.", "Decked out with sharp and colorful design work, some well-drawn characters and six snappy Randy Newman tunes, this first entry from Turner Feature Animation goes down very easily but lacks a hook.", "", "Cute kid-flick, and a must-see for Scott Bakula fans.", "While the animated characters, bright colors and an appealing Randy Newman score may keep the children content, Cats Don't Dance is no saccharine fantasy. Its Hollywood references and dark satire constitute its real strengths.", "A happy-go-lucky romp that dishes up the most cartoon fun since Toy Story.", "", "", "For you fuddy duddies out there who think cartoons are for kids, I don't know when the last time you saw a cartoon was, but movie cartoons have never been for kids.", "A startling miscalculation.
