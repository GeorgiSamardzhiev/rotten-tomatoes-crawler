But he's not growing quietly.", "There is a lot of frank conversation about the technical aspects of sex between women, but Holden and Banky are written more like sniggering eighth graders than inquisitive adults.", "Chasing Amy represents a change in direction for Smith, with drama before gags. A chick flick for blokes.", "The movie reinforces his gift for dialogue, but his ability to handle actors, compose scenes or keep track of his own story is negligible.", "Chasing Amy often is convulsively funny.", "[A] cool, hilarious and sexy romantic comedy.", "As in Smith's debut film, Clerks, there's something about the scruffy Chasing Amy that breaks through the pretenses of more conventional movies.", "Even when its young, uncertain characters appear to be in danger of talking (and whining) themselves to death, there's something genuine and charmingly naive about their attempts to make sense of their feelings.", "Although [Smith's] dialogue is often witty, he still relies on blunt sexual humor to get his point across.", "Affleck and Lee have a great comic thing going on.", "Chasing Amy is not yet a mature work Smith still needs a style to go with his sensibility but its yearning for maturity is palpable and touching.", "The performances are universally strong. The goateed Affleck makes for a particularly sympathetic protagonist; he has the looks and confidence of a lady-killer, but nagging befuddlement and vulnerability are rarely far from the surface.", "Dated romantic comedy wrong for all kids.", "The third installment of Kevin Smith's New Jersey Trilogy is also the only Kevin Smith movie that's worth any serious attention.", "Like a raw nerve tweaked over and over again by emotions both radiant and revealing, Chasing Amy is as close to a masterpiece as Smith has ever created.", "Chasing Amy suggests that Smith could do so much better if only he would push himself.", "Smith's most mature film. Yes, it's filled with crude dialogue, blunt descriptions of sex and an overkill of Star Wars references, but it uses these to dig deeper and make its subject matter more accessible."], "rating": ["", "2/5", "3.5/4", "3/4", "", "4/5", "2/4", "", "4/5", "", "3/4", "2/4", "3/4", "3/4", "3.5/4", "2/5", "8", "4.5/5", "3/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Michael Atkinson", "PJ Nabarro", "Steven Rea", "Dan Webster", "Paul Tatara", "", "Gary Thompson", "Roger Hurlburt", "Jo Berry", "Jay Boyar", "John Hartl", "David Sterritt", "Stephen Hunter", "Dave Kehr", "Mark Caro", "Carly Kocurek", "Radheyan Simonpillai", "Bill Gibron", "Matt Noller", "Ryan Cracknell"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spokesman-Review (Washington)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNN.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AskMen.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">PopMatters", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slant Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Views"], "date": ["October 25, 2019", "November 5, 2018", "February 7, 2014", "February 7, 2014", "February 7, 2014", "February 7, 2014", "February 7, 2014", "February 7, 2014", "February 7, 2014", "February 7, 2014", "February 7, 2014", "February 7, 2014", "February 7, 2014", "February 7, 2014", "February 7, 2014", "January 1, 2011", "November 4, 2010", "November 21, 2009", "November 16, 2009", "November 15, 2009"]}}
