What young Orson Welles accomplishes in mere 2 hours is mind-blowing. [Full review in Spanish]", "Citizen Kane was a cinematic achievement for its time...", "Kane is unforgettable and his intense character study is a masterpiece of cinematic sublimity that is rarely, if ever, equaled.", "The question of whether twenty-six-year-old Orson Welles is a genius or an accident seems to be settled for all time by his very first screen effort, written, produced, directed and acted by Welles himself.", "This is a great picture, any way one looks at it. And it brings to the motion picture industry an exciting new personality -- Orson Welles, a man whose talents both as actor and director will be acclaimed by adult audiences far and wide.", "The satire here is as savage as Swift's, and in its unrelenting light the victim becomes positively nauseous; yet the treatment is brilliant and continuously pleases the aesthetic sense.", "[Citizen Kane] is a stirring, magnificent movie... It is always freshly conceived in that it uses the camera in ways that have not been seen exactly that way before.", "Welles is the most exciting thing that's happened since sound.", "Welles has shown Hollywood how to make movies.", "Citizen Kane, written, produced, and directed by a young man of 25 whom America considers a genius, is an outstanding film, amazing in its presentation and vast in its conception.", "Most people don't care about Kane's cutting edge techniques but there's so much more to admire, appreciate and enjoy about this cinematic edifice.", "The realism, the development of the scenes, and the connection that is established so that the public doesn't lose the thread of the narrative is something truly extraordinary that we have not seen before. [Full Review in Spanish]", "It proves Welles' restless, reckless genius -- as exasperating as it is fascinating -- is triumphant in the new medium as it was in the old ones of theater and radio.", "A film in which every minute is planned, everything works, not a second wasted, not a frame too much; stripped to the gears and yet rich with cinematic decoration.", "There are few more endlessly engrossing character studies to be found in the history of the medium.", "Orson Welles was ahead of his time.", "Welles almost creates a mise en abyme throughout Citizen Kane, inviting but ultimately refuting the tendency to want to reduce everything to one core sentimental genesis.", "It is a triumph of the film, and proof of its solid value and of the sense of its director and all concerned, that a human touch is not lost. Sympathy for the preposterous Mr. Kane survives. Indeed, there is something about him which seems admirable.", "The construction is deliberately episodic, and individual settings often appear to owe more to the modern conceptions of stage-technique than to the cinema. But the ingenuity with which the episodes are assembled sets a new level in film-construction.", "Welles' performance is nothing less than astonishing. He begins as a youth of 21, goes through middle age to his death, and makes every moment believable in voice, walk, and gesture. Even in his love scenes is Welles effective."], "rating": ["5/5", "5/5", "1", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "", "", "4/4", "A+", "5/5", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Fico Cangiano", "Danielle Solzman", "Mike Massie", "Shadow Stage", "P.S.
