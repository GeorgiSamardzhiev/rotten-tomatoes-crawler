{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When hotheaded Superboy (Michael Rapaport) accidentally gets involved in an ugly racially-motivated incident, his uncle Ray Donlan (Harvey Keitel), a corrupt New York City cop, attempts to sweep it under the rug by helping fake his nephew's death.

My opinion? He succeeded in spades.", "'Cop Land' holds up as a pretty good little thriller, a Sidney Lumet movie in a Martin Scorsese movie's clothing.", "Top acting honors go to Ray Liotta as Gary Figgis, a cokehead cop who just might be Freddy's only friend.", "not your traditional action flick, nor your traditional cop flick. It has elements of each, all wrapped up in a new type of story that drips in realism and gray characters.", "Mangold certainly knew what he was doing when he cast Keitel and De Niro.", "Cop Land shares its leading man's slow-wittedness, but also his likability.", "Mangold is something of a pseudo-Scorsese.", "A good effort, but the star power on show throws the proceedings off kilter somewhat, hiking up an expectation that the film ultimately cannot live up to.", "A low-key tale of corrupt cops that recalls the gritty police procedurals of the 70s.", "It's pretty funny, actually, that Stallone gained 40 pounds to play this role, and what the movie needs more than anything else is to eat a salad and do some sit-ups.", "It sizzles toward an explosive and satisfying climax in which everything -- Stallone included -- fully bursts into life.", "Although too simplistic in its good-guys/bad-guys approach to morally and emotionally ambiguous material, Cop Land emerges as an absorbing and dramatic yarn about exposing the evil doings of some of New York's finest.", "A solidly entertaining drama that stays true to the independent spirit of its filmmakers", "At its heart, the movie has a good story to tell: the lumbering oaf who's not nearly as stupid and not nearly as gutless as all the hot dogs from the big city think.", "The movie's no roller-coaster ride, but there isn't a boring moment either.", "At times, it's like three episodes of NYPD Blue jammed together and whittled down to feature length.", "Mangold went to so much trouble to give Stallone a good role, but he forgot to write good parts for Robert De Niro, Harvey Keitel, Ray Liotta, Annabella Sciorra and Cathy Moriarity.", "The mystery suspense elements, however, grind from implausibility (the set-up), to clich (the climax), with too much back story in between."], "rating": ["", "2.5/5", "", "", "3/4", "4/5", "B-", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "2.5/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Rachel Wagner", "Leigh Paatsch", "Ed Travis", "Jason Bailey", "Matt Brunson", "Kevin Carr", "Owen Gleiberman", "David Edelstein", "Jack Kroll", "Ian Freer", "", "Paul Tatara", "Sandra Contreras", "Todd McCarthy", "", "Stephen Hunter", "Lisa Alspector", "Rob Gonsalves", "Jeffrey M.
