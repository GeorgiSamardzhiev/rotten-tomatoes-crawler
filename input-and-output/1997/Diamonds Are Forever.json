There are some fun moments and some silly moments that I can't defend (like multiple Blofelds) but sadly I felt cheated (and still do) on what this film could have been.", "How good it was to see the gadgets again, the gymnastic grace of the fantasy-violence, the comedy of the imaginary sex, and that quality of the Bond pictures at their best which I can only call geniality.", "Has some dramatic merit and is one of the better films in the entire franchise.", "The script is poor, the comedy ill-timed and the ending anticlimactic. What more can I say?", "Has its flaws, but being a boring Bond movie isn't one of them. It may not hit top tier status, but Connery makes \"Diamonds Are Forever\" another gem in the 007 mythos.", "Connery's last official Bond film is energetic but violent.", "After an hiatus, Sean Connery was lured back to the series with a huge paycheck but the end result is decidedly a mediocre feature.", "After struggling with a few films to find the right vibe and tone for a Bond film, DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER finds a nice balance that would work for a while.", "Thanks to the clarity and cut of past 007 films, Sean Connery will sparkle forever. But with a dearth of action and only a fat paycheck as motivation, \"Diamonds\" feels less like a triumphant return and more like a cheesed-up cabaret version of Bond.", "Makes the disastrous, franchise-altering decision to underscore how fusty Bond is by diving right into campines.", "The clumsily executed climax reduces the quality of the film considerably.", "Bond looks better than ever, partly because Sean Connery has returned to play him.", "Next door to glass, but aided by the return of Connery.", "Connery has a ball with great stunts, snappy dialogue and a bevy of typically Bondish beauties.", "Fairly forgetable addition to the 007 series, bringing Connery's tenure to a unsatisfying close.", "Diamonds Are Forever doesn't carry the same quality or flair as its many predecessors.", "Assorted ladies, a few quick lines, and one good chase, making for a mediocre entry in the series.", "The funniest Bond movie"], "rating": ["", "4/10", "2/5", "", "3/5", "1/5", "7.5/10", "3/5", "B-", "3/4", "2/5", "6/10", "B", "", "3/5", "3/5", "", "", "", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jake Tropila", "Mike Massie", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Thomas Berger", "PJ Nabarro", "David Hogan", "Jeffrey Lyles", "Jeffrey M.
