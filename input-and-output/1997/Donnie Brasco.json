{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Joseph Pistone (Johnny Depp) is an FBI agent who has infiltrated one of the major New York Mafia families and is living under the name Donnie Brasco. He develops a relationship with mob hit man Benjamin \"Lefty\" Ruggiero (Al Pacino) in order to get deeper under cover, but ends up developing a real friendship with the Mafioso. As their relationship develops, Pistone must decide whether or not to complete his job, knowing that it will lead to the murder of his new friend.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 6m", "director": "Mike Newell", "studio": "TriStarPictures,BaltimorePictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$42.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A clever insight into the everyday, professional banalities of life as a low to mid-level gangster.", "This is Depp's coming-of-age role, and he's terrific. Pacino, who's shown more flash than substance recently, reminds us how great he can be when he loses himself inside a character.", "", "A gritty and humorous crime drama about an undercover cop infiltrating the Mafia.", "Depp's tight, guarded performance is almost painful to watch, and Newell seems to have reined in the flamboyant Pacino, whose portrait of the mobster as a grumpy old man may be his best work in years.", "It's tempting to think Pacino stopped trying sometime in the mid-1980s. But watch Lefty's elegiac final scene and you might conclude that it's not Al's ability that's dimmed, rather it's the imagination of casting directors that's grown stale.", "Although perhaps familiar in its outer trappings, Pacino's fine work is the key to the film succeeding to the extent that it does.", "[Newell and Attanasio] pay as much attention to emotional details as to the clockwork details of mob life.", "Just misses ranking in the upper echelon of mob movies.", "A tense, sharp and compelling character study, Newell's film is a worthy addition to the Mob-movie canon.", "A classy piece of work that may disappoint those looking for something more conventional.", "A blue collar gangster movie that succeeds on all attempted levels, particularly acting.", "Donnie Brasco is a fine movie but it might just be best remembered as Johnny Depp's coming-out party. A star -- check that, an actor -- is born.", "Shows that solid acting and writing can salvage even material that has been covered by much better filmmakers.", "Donnie Brasco manages to sidestep the obvious and dwell on the intriguing.", "In almost every respect, Donnie Brasco is an original, the unexpected rebirth of an old and oft-told tale.", "Donnie Brasco is 120 minutes of riveting filmmaking.", "Unfortunately, the story isn't inventive and Newell's methodical approach to it verges on monotony.", "It's gritty, real and totally engrossing.", "A first-class Mafia thriller that is also, in its way, a love story."], "rating": ["3/5", "", "A-", "A", "3.5/4", "", "", "5/5", "B+", "", "3.5/4", "B+", "B+", "6/10", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "4/4", "", "4.5/5", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["PJ Nabarro", "David Ansen", "Owen Gleiberman", "Dennis Schwartz", "Maitland McDonagh", "", "Todd McCarthy", "Rob Gonsalves", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "", "Michael Dequina", "Robin Clifford", "Philip Martin", "Dragan Antulov", "Jeanne Aufmuth", "Margaret A.
