{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Shy, neurotic Terry (David Arquette) spends his days spying on neighbors through binoculars. One night, he decides to jump off a bridge but can't bring himself to end it all. Nick (Brad Hunt), a cocky artist with a terminal disease, arrives on the scene, and they make a pact. If Terry helps Nick live out his fantasies in his final days, Nick will pay him back by killing him. The two head out on a road trip, where they drop acid, bowl naked, open old wounds and live life on the edge.", "rating": "60", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Finn Taylor", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$556.7K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Despite the emphasis on Oedipal conflict, the film expresses no desire to enter the grownup world; happiness here is associated with eternal adolescence, following the '70s (and now, apparently, '90s) ideal.", "A throwback to the independent-minded, anything-goes movies that followed in the wake of Easy Rider in the early 1970s.", "Clearly, it wishes to be different, but anyone who fondly recalls the buddy films of the '70s will find it to be more of the same.", "Dream With The Fishes is quite a moving but perplexing film.", "Dream With the Fishes is a personal kind of story told with a sensitivity that, while not exactly Oscar-worthy, does manage to touch on feelings most mainstream films don't even admit exist.", "The quirky-misfits-on-the-road genre is nothing new or revolutionary, but the film possesses a naive charm that is as refreshing as it is rare.", "Parts of the movie focusing on drugs and wanderlust seem like throwbacks to the '60s, but most of the story is more self-indulgent than sociological.", "Not a great picture -- not by a long shot -- but the many and various parts of Finn Taylor's quirky black comedy do add up to something rather appealing.", "Nothing here is sufficiently wild.", "It isn't nearly as compelling or profound as it's meant to be.", "As the film progresses, however, it begins to accumulate all sorts of unnecessary characters and subplots that only serve to weigh it down.", "A harangue on how ironic it is that men often attack one another verbally and physically as a way to get close.", "[A] refreshing, unexpectedly profound comedy.", "It's well acted, and the dialogue didn't insult me.
