{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Over the course of a long, hot Louisiana summer, a 10-year-old black girl, Eve Batiste (Jurnee Smollett), discovers that her family's affluent existence is merely a facade. The philandering of her suave doctor father, Louis (Samuel L. Jackson), creates a rift, throwing Eve's mother, Roz (Lynn Whitfield), and teenage sister, Cisely (Meagan Good), into emotional turmoil. Eve, though, manages to find some solace with her quirky psychic aunt, Mozelle (Debbi Morgan).", "rating": "82", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Kasi Lemmons", "studio": "TrimarkPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 7, 2016", "box_office": "$14.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Lemmons pursues the story with a sharp-eyed, naturalistic clarity that emphasizes the family's authentic emotional pressures along with the strangeness of the supernatural powers that impose a higher responsibility-and a grim burden-on the young heroine.", "An extraordinary mood piece that's also a piercing, challenging, and tenderly sad character study.", "'90s African American family drama has violence, language.", "This one is the real torch carrier for a literate new beginning.", "'Eve''s finest quality is the thrill of a confident filmmaker working with material that risks silliness, and pulling it off.", "", "More than anything, about the nature of memory and how it rarely matches the truth of life.", "", "", "The film is given an almost dream-like quality by Vincent who washes everything in a sepia-type tone that adds to the effect of seeing an adult world of deceit and hurt through the eyes of a child.", "Lemmons' focus on strong female characters, and her willingness to ignore accepted notions of \"black filmmaking\" are powerful assets, but one can't help wishing the film as a whole lived up to its initial promise.", "Subplots are woven stealthily into the story, taking the pressure off the central drama, allowing it to be affecting rather than melodramatic, and heightening the atmosphere of the lush Louisiana setting.", "A sparkling directorial debut.", "An intensely emotional drama that mixes elements of Southern Gothic with the kinds of characters and tensions that prevail in the plays of Southern writers like Tennessee Williams.", "Writer/director Kasi Lemmons shows sweet judgment here, doesn't caricature or demonise the errant father, and elicits a host of nuanced performances from women of all ages.", "It feels like I've seen dozens of films this year by first time writers and directors, and not one has stuck to me until now.", "", "", "A solid, if somewhat heavy-handed, Southern Gothic tale, steeped in mysticism.", ""], "rating": ["", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "A-", "3.5/4", "8/10", "4/4", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "3/4", "", "3.5/4", "3/5", "2/5", "", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Brody", "Tim Brayton", "Lynnette Nicholas", "Paul Tatara", "Jason Bailey", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Michael Dequina", "Jack Garner", "Susan Stark", "", "Ken Fox", "Lisa Alspector", "Andrew Sarris", "Emanuel Levy", "", "Jeffrey M.
