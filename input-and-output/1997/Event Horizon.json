Accompanied by the Event Horizon's creator, William Weir (Sam Neill), the crew of the Lewis and Clark, led by Capt. Miller (Laurence Fishburne), begins to explore the seemingly abandoned vessel. However, it soon becomes evident that something sinister resides in its corridors, and that the horrors that befell the Event Horizon's previous journey are still present.", "rating": "28", "genre": "Horror/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Paul W.S.

But, to paraphrase Winston Churchill, never have so many done so much to such little purpose.", "But, to its credit, Event Horizon never pretends to be anything other than a series of highly efficient rip-offs.", "Very early on, this defective dramatic vehicle runs out of fuel, degenerates into a slasher/Hellraiser wannabe and self- destructs among explosions, flames and streams of blood.", "Director Anderson gets points for skillfully choreographing all of this, but he loses them for a consistent desire to brutalize the audience.", "Don't worry, it's not you. It really doesn't make any sense.", "By the time the story gets rolling, the filmmakers are trying unsuccessfully to scare the audience with sudden loud noises and gallon upon gallon of fake blood.", "The film is content to relentlessly scream \"Boo!\" behind the audience's back rather than provide any real thrills", "In space, apparently, no one can hear you direct.", "[Anderson] has little feeling for suspense - instead he lays on the violence and gore with a trowel and diminishing returns are the result."], "rating": ["2.5/5", "6/10", "", "", "1.5/4", "3/5", "2/4", "", "", "", "", "2/4", "", "", "", "", "", "2/5", "", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["James Croot", "Mike Massie", "Evan Dossey", "Leah Rozen", "Chris Kridler", "John Ferguson", "Dennis King", "Roger Hurlburt", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Ryan Gilbey", "Bob Thomas", "John Petrakis", "Matthew Sweet", "Owen McNally", "Kenneth Turan", "Paul Tatara", "John Krewson", "Ken Fox", "Robert Wilonsky", "David Stratton"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Stuff.co.nz", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Midwest Film Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent on Sunday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNN.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dallas Observer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">At the Movies (Australia)"], "date": ["September 15, 2020", "September 11, 2020", "January 19, 2019", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018"]}}
