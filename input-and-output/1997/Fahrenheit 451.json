Very forgettable.

That doesn't really come across in this adaptation; rather it sets up several pathways that remain unexplored.", "While the film attempts to put its own spin on the story for the digital age, Bahrani's film does not measure up to the source material.", "[This] adaptation of Ray Bradburry's classic novel doesn't really shock the core like it should, mostly because it's a movie that wants the essence of a narrative without really digging into the themes.", "HBO's Fahrenheit 451 is horrifically beautiful. It feels both divorced from and intrinsically tied to its source material, the 1953 dystopian novel by Ray Bradbury.", "There are things that work with the adaptation that could have been even more successful given time to play out over the course of a season.", "This lavish HBO-produced adaptation certainly looks the part, but does feel a touch light on for impact considering the weight of the themes it is carrying.", "Bahrani's fondness for drama with a social justice angle is revealed in the backstory...and does not go much farther than general finger-wagging at screen-addiction and the herd mentality found on network echo chambers.", "HBO's adaptation of Ray Bradbury's classic \"Fahrenheit 451\" ultimately loses the plot.", "Soggy, violent adaptation of book-burning sci-fi classic.", "Fahrenheit 451, though initially compelling, ultimately does little to expand the prominent ideas of Ray Bradbury's work.", "There are, of course, accommodations... there is talk of the Internet, that \"people read less and less,\" the emojis - which were not in the original published in 1953.
