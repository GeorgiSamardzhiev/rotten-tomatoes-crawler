Such is the price of years of success. Family Plot, while not up to those usual standards, is still crackling good cinema.", "Out of respect for Hitchcock's stature, and his years, Family Plot should be considered as fleetingly as possible.", "Hitchcock's final picture is not one of the classics but has many of the elements that made him great.", "[A] small masterpiece, one of Hitchcock's most adventurous and expressive experiments in narrative form.", "A marvellously fluid light comedy with scarcely a slack moment.", "The movie is a gentle trifle, a pleasant diversion from a man who knows what he's doing every step of the way.", "Family Plot is at times a pure mechanical construction, an endless game where the different actions and protagonists intertwine without gaining something.
