{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This animated tale follows the relationship between the small human-like Oms and their much larger blue-skinned oppressors, the Draags, who rule the planet of Ygam. While the Draags have long kept Oms as illiterate pets, this hierarchy shifts after an Om boy becomes educated, thanks to a young female Draag. This leads to an Om rebellion, which weakens the Draag control over their race. Will the Oms and the Draags find a way to coexist? Or will they destroy each other?", "rating": "91", "genre": "Animation/Art House & International/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 11m", "director": "Ren\u00e9 Laloux", "studio": "ArgosFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Humor and pathos underline a fine adventure story.", "This is a beautiful work of art which combines serious sci-fi with fanciful designs, a distinct style and a big message.
