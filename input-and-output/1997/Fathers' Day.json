{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Jack (Billy Crystal) is a straitlaced lawyer with a loving wife (Julia Louis-Dreyfus). Dale (Robin Williams) is suicidal about his stalled career as an artist. The only thing they have in common is Collette (Nastassja Kinski), with whom they both had an affair years ago. Unbeknownst to the two men, she had a son, Scott (Charlie Hofheimer), who is now missing. After she tells Jack and Dale that one of them could be the father, the pair set out to find Scott and prove who the real father is.", "rating": "25", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Ivan Reitman", "studio": "NorthernLightsEntertainment,WarnerBros.,SilverPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2009", "box_office": "$28.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's a wonder that these stars couldn't produce a funnier result, even with the faults of a weak script and poor pacing.", "This thoroughly sad and lazy comedy pairs Robin Williams and Billy Crystal as would-be fathers searching for a Sugar Ray-obsessed teenage wastoid. Unfunny non-hijinx ensue.", "Father's Day has a few laugh-out-loud sequences, but it's nothing to celebrate.", "A movie of implacable unfunniness.", "For the comic actors, this project -- an enjoyable synthesis of improvisation and adherence to the original story -- seems almost too easy. You wonder why it took them so long.", "Williams and Crystal often supply, through their ad libs, what the writers may have left out.", "Hey, it sounded good on paper.", "Despite some laughs, there's not much of a story. But at least Williams and Crystal, old pals off the screen, seem to be enjoying themselves.", "Williams and Crystal find their own rhythm with the material and deliver some much needed laughs.", "There is something faintly depressing about seeing an inspired comedian like Robin Williams and a clever one like Billy Crystal starring in a movie that might just as well have been based on My Two Dads.", "Fans of Crystal and Williams certainly will enjoy the pairing, but this is far from their most inspired work.", "Add to these problems the fact that Fathers' Day is a comedy starring two reputedly hilarious people who don't make you laugh once, and you have a movie that would be great if everything about it weren't terrible.", "Fathers' Day scoots along pleasantly but never rises above its My Two Dads sitcom premise.", "This had the potential to be hilarious, but instead falls alarmingly flat thanks to a weak and jokeless script that even the combined comedic talents of Williams and Crystal can't perk up.", "Ivan Reitman directs Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel's adaptation like standard-issue sitcom, inviting Williams to pursue his usual overacting shtick.", "Likable performances, but the story's brash and hyper, though sweet, delivery grows wearing, especially the sexual innuendo.", "The plot is full of the kind of holes necessary to set up cream-puff moments where everybody turns huggy and learns Valuable Lessons. Ugh.", "How much you enjoy the film will depend entirely on how much you enjoy the spectacle of Williams spewing forth streams of nonsensical gibberish in an attempt to impersonate a German record producer, and Crystal pitching snit fits.", "Reitman, Williams and Crystal should have turned in a fine comedy. But Father's Day ain't it: they could have improvised a better film in their sleep.", "Thankfully low on sentimentality, director Reitman gives the two stand-up talents a pretty free rein, resulting in some classic comic moments and snappy one-liners."], "rating": ["2/10", "1/5", "", "", "", "3/4", "2/4", "2.5/4", "3/5", "2/5", "2/4", "", "", "2/5", "", "", "", "2/4", "2/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Daniel Barnes", "Carol Buckland", "Joe Morgenstern", "Desson Thomson", "Michael Wilmington", "Steven Rea", "Robert Dominguez", "Bob McCabe", "Jay Boyar", "Doug Thomas", "Keith Phipps", "Leah Rozen", "Jo Berry", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Katherine Dillin", "Rod Dreher", "Maitland McDonagh", "", "Film4 Staff"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dare Daniel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNN.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4"], "date": ["September 11, 2020", "August 4, 2020", "July 14, 2014", "July 14, 2014", "July 14, 2014", "July 14, 2014", "July 14, 2014", "July 14, 2014", "July 14, 2014", "July 14, 2014", "July 14, 2014", "July 14, 2014", "July 14, 2014", "July 14, 2014", "July 14, 2014", "July 14, 2014", "July 14, 2014", "July 14, 2014", "July 14, 2014", "July 14, 2014"]}}
