When Charles meets a beautiful American named Carrie (Andie MacDowell) at a wedding, he thinks his luck may have changed. But, after one magical night, Carrie returns to the States, ending what might have been. As Charles and Carrie's paths continue to cross -- over a handful of nuptials and one funeral -- he comes to believe they are meant to be together, even if their timing always seems to be off.", "rating": "96", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "Mike Newell", "studio": "PolyGramFilmedEntertainment,ChannelFourFilms,WorkingTitleFilms", "theater_date": "Mar 9, 1994", "dvd_date": "Nov 29, 2016", "box_office": "$49.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A likable, heartwarming bit of entertainment that propelled Grant's career and proved to be box office gold.", "It doesn't matter how many times you see it, you're always going to smile.", "In a sense, these young, moneyed, unattached, attractive folks could just as easily exist in the universe of a Whit Stillman film. Yet Curtis and Newell ultimately have hearts too soft to deny them, or us, at least a bit of \"true love\" sentimentality.", "Richard Curtis's screenplay is a celebration, and the film's success is that we end up celebrating with it.", "It's rare to see in a British film: a dramatic point that doesn't hinge on dialogue. Four Weddings and a Funeral is a lightweight affair, but this is one of several fine touches that make it, on the whole, a cause for celebration rather than for mourning.", "Although the film is basically a light romantic comedy, it couldn't be more psychologically astute in its portrait of a man who defines himself by his bachelorhood, which empowers him to get past his fear of commitment.", "Deftly written by Richard Curtis and directed by the versatile Mike Newell, Four Weddings is as good as its word, breezily following a small circle of friends through every one of the events the title promises.", "Four Weddings and a Funeral is one of those rare films that have you smiling from the get-go, and keep you that way -- with a few well-earned poignant interludes (including, of all things, a reading of W.H. Auden) -- right to the end.", "Most of the acting is first-rate, with special credit going to Grant as the hero and Simon Callow in a memorable supporting role.", "The pitch-perfect profanity, bumbling romanticism and Hugh Grant's floppy-fringed charm remain enduringly, endearingly funny.", "Four Weddings and a Funeral is a rare movie commodity, an adult comedy that takes a mostly smart, mordant approach to such topics as sex and romance.", "Hugh Grant's body English captures every nuance of his character's confusion precisely and hilariously.", "If anyone asks if you want to see Four Weddings and a Funeral, just say \"I do.\"", "Neatly structured and full of genuine warmth for its characters, Richard Curtis's Oscar-nominated screenplay is superbly observed and well served by Mike Newell's deft direction.", "As directed with a light touch by Mike Newell, there's little doubt as to where it is going or how it will be resolved. That's all right, since getting there is so much fun.", "The setup is too arch to support the movie's detour into poignance, though John Hannah does give a moving reading of W. H. Auden's \"Funeral Blues.\"", "The movie dazzles with its slick lines, but there's a situational intelligence at play too.", "Conveys everything that is hilariously and poignantly true about the ceremonies we use to tie the knot and bid loved ones farewell.", "Not everything works out neatly for everyone, but life seems a little better by the end of two hours' struggle, for the characters and for the audience.
