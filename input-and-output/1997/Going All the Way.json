{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Korean War--era veterans and ex-classmates \"Gunner\" Casselman (Ben Affleck) and \"Sonny\" Burns (Jeremy Davies) reunite upon their return home. Gunner, who spent the war years abroad, is trying to convince his mother that his gal Marty (Rachel Weisz) is good enough for him, while Sonny, who was stationed stateside, is torn between loyal Buddy (Amy Locane) and tempting Gale Ann (Rose McGowan). As they commiserate, the men realize that they're outgrowing the lives they lived before the war.", "rating": "68", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 50m", "director": "Mark Pellington", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$86.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Wakefield's trenchant coming-of-age tale uses a classic pairing of utterly contrasting types to ground his exploration of innocence and experience, of complacency and the thirst for adventure...", "The leading men never quite show us the essence of their unlikely friendship.", "", "", "This funny, oddly moving little film is distinguished by some fine acting.", "Ultimately it's goofy and a little bit confusing, but a few of its insights are worthwhile, if far from unique in this genre.", "", "", "", "Davies and Affleck, though actors of different styles, share a genuine rapport, and their scenes together seem honest and compassionate.", "[A] myopic male gauntlet of shrews and Jews.", "Wakefield, Pellington and company have much to be proud of here. Hopefully, their work will show other filmmakers that classic books can become winning films, when talented artists respect the integrity of the source.", "The only thing that sets it apart from so many forgettable period piece coming-of-age stories is that it has been put together with a degree of care and skill.", "Even if it's too self-conscious, Going All the Way, set in 1950s Indianapolis, nevertheless has a mix of the sweet and the forlorn that somehow works.", "I'm a decade younger than the characters in this movie, but I grew up in a time and place not far from the film's psychic setting.
