{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A gadget salesman is looking for a special gift for his son and finds one at a store in Chinatown. The shopkeeper is reluctant to sell him the \"mogwai\" but sells it to him with the warning to never expose him to bright light, water, or to feed him after midnight. All of this happens and the result is a gang of gremlins that decide to tear up the town on Christmas Eve.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Comedy/Horror/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Joe Dante", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,AmblinEntertainment", "theater_date": "Jun 8, 1984", "dvd_date": "Jun 2, 2014", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...a genuine classic that holds up remarkably well all these years later.", "A thrilling anti-Christmas product, effectively mocking other no-nonsense evil alien endeavors to become a staple of the horror comedy subgenre.", "GREMLINS  is definitely a product of its time, but it's got a lot of heart.", "Joe Dante's Gremlins quickly fixes itself as a rare Christmas horror movie classic", "A film that knows how to masterfully combine terror with humor, family spirit and countless winks to moviegoers, without ever spoiling the mix. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Unlike the fabrication of the gremlins, the rest of the movie, with its terrible first part, is clumsier. [Full Review in Spanish]", "As a black comedy, a satirical look at consumerism, and a movie bursting with Christmas cheer, no matter the descriptor- Joe Dante's Gremlins is a classic.", "Benefits from one of the most underappreciated musical scores of the 1980s.", "It is a wacky, satirical spectacle of chaos.", "The visual effects are imaginative, yet the jokey tone too often throws the entire film off.", "If you grew up in the '80's and remember a simpler time without cell phones or you want to introduce your kids to the \"magic\" of 1980's films then Gremlins is a great place to start.", "The film showcases Dante's two cinematic loves: 1950's era sci-fi/horror and The Looney Tunes. The two forms merge together to create a cautionary tale of Christmas gifts gone awry.", "Spoof horror doesn't horrify, it sickens. Spoof comedy doesn't amuse, it annoys. Spoof comic horror is for the stuffed birds.", "There is satire here: a sense of silly but thoughtful consideration on the Christmas traditions and how easily all the relatable facades crumble as a consequence of simple illusions being so easily shattered.", "An entertaining and original horror film with top notch effects, a great villain, and a brilliant score...", "Dante thrives in the spaces between comfort and terror: that mischievous place where you're never quite sure if the monsters are kidding or not.", "A wildly original roller-coaster ride of hilarious mischief.", "Here's the season's most delicious and unexpected surprise. Despite the horror-flick title, Gremlins is a movie of wicked wit and startling invention, and it has a heart that's at least a match for the special effects.", "Think of A Christmas Carol visited by The Birds. Think of The Muppet Movie run amok.
