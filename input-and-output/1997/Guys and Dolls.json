{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Gambler Nathan Detroit (Frank Sinatra) has few options for the location of his big craps game. Needing $1,000 to pay a garage owner to host the game, Nathan bets Sky Masterson (Marlon Brando) that Sky cannot get virtuous Sarah Brown (Jean Simmons) out on a date. Despite some resistance, Sky negotiates a date with her in exchange for bringing people into her mission. Meanwhile, Nathan's longtime fianc\u00e9e, Adelaide (Vivian Blaine), wants him to go legit and marry her.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "2h 30m", "director": "Joseph L.

It's over-long at two and a half hours but liberally loaded with laughter and sentiment in the appropriate Damon Runyon tradition.", "The script is perhaps even better than most of the musical numbers, crackling with the Damon Runyon-style dialogue and with the colour of the stories on which Ben Hecht based his screenplay.", "The showtunes are weapons-grade: especially Sit Down You're Rockin' the Boat, which never fails to get any audience on its feet. A must.", "Joseph L Mankiewicz's adaptation of the Frank Loesser Broadway musical, itself adapted from Damon Runyon stories, looks a treat. The wonder of the film is that it combines widescreen colour and opulence with an earthy, street-level humour.", "Brando the singing actor and Sinatra the acting singer make a remarkable pair as sharp-suited gangsters and gamblers, along with their \"dolls\", Vivian Blaine and the English actress Jean Simmons.", "Brando and Sinatra are on top form, but it's Simmons who steals the show.", "A proper CinemaScope delight, with fabulous dialogue, wonderful tunes.", "An escapist, sing-along joy with a winning edge of grown-up wit, making for a perfect festive season night out for anyone fond of a splash of old-school style.", "Ultimate odd couple Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra play charismatic cats in hats and spats on the mean (but very clean) streets of New York.", "Brando wasn't producer Sam Goldwyn's first choice as Sky (that was Gene Kelly) but he acquits himself outstandingly.", "Conceivably the best picture Sam Goldwyn ever produced.", "A great play but just a good movie.", "Though assigned to the wrong director (Mankiewicz), the musical movie still maintains some charm, largely due to the performances of Sinatra and Brando", "Classic Sinatra/Brando musical is a whole lot of fun.", "Guys and Dolls is a bangup filmusical in the topdrawer Goldwyn manner.", "Too talky.", "A musical fairly glittering with intelligence and invention.", "No one's cool enough to blow off a movie starring Marlon Brando and Frank Sinatra.
