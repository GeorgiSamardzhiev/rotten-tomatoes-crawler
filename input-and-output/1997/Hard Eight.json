The whole thing seemed kind of smug to me", "Just a soupcon of livelier drama would have improved the proceedings considerably.", "This first feature by writer-director Paul Thomas Anderson is impressive for its lean and unblemished storytelling, but even more so for its performances.", "The film doesn't rush, it's not self-absorbed in the Tarantino fashion, it just clicks along relentlessly, picking up power, particularly as threats develop to Sid's well-ordered view of the world.", "Despite the somewhat lethargic pace, this is a cool, sharply observed thriller that knows its own strengths and makes the most of them.", "Although it tries to be clever, knowing and gritty, Hard Eight is never more than boring.", "It's done with such intelligence and feeling, and such a brilliant cast, that it grips our attention from first shuffle to last bet.", "Hard Eight is endlessly watchable thanks to Anderson's ability to intersect form and content.", "While this crime drama is too down-in-the-mouth for most tastes, it remains a fascinating document of the early days of an incredible talent.", "Hard Eight wouldn't be the compelling story it is without Philip Baker Hall as its center of gravity and values. Anderson wrote the script with Baker in mind, and it's about time somebody did.", "A clever, confident debut from Paul Thomas Anderson and a showcase role for character actor Philip Baker Hall.", "A near-classic in a minor key, and a must-see for fans of later work.", "Gamblers live for the moment - for the next bet, the one that will take them over the top - and this gilt-edged noir contraption is an enjoyable wallow in life-is-a-craps-table existentialism.", "...a low-key yet sporadically fascinating drama...", "This minor Vegas-set drama, about a loser and his older mentor, shows the features that will mark Anderson's better films: love for his characters, taut dialogue at the expense of plot, and fascination with the possibilities of the film medium.", "", "", "", "Estria de Anderson, mostra que o diretor sempre teve talento para contar histrias, embora ainda no tivesse confiana o bastante para criar as belas tomadas e movimentos de cmera que marcam seus trabalhos posteriores."], "rating": ["7/10", "", "2/5", "", "3/4", "3/5", "", "3/4", "", "3.5/5", "", "3/4", "", "B", "3.5/4", "B-", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Rachel Wagner", "Christopher Hemblade", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Stephen Hunter", "Alan Jones", "Total Film Staff", "Michael Wilmington", "Drew Morton", "Leigh Paatsch", "Richard T.
