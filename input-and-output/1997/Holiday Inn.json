{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this Irving Berlin musical, Jim (Bing Crosby) and Lila are members of a performing trio who plan to quit and run a country hotel. When Lila says she has fallen in love with the dancer in the act, Ted (Fred Astaire), Jim leaves town with a broken heart. After turning the inn into a holidays-only live entertainment venue, Jim winds up booking -- and falling for -- Linda (Marjorie Reynolds). But when Ted shows up at the place after being dumped by Lila, he too sets his sights on beautiful Linda.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Musical & Performing Arts/Romance", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Mark Sandrich", "studio": "Paramount", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 7, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Everything here is entertaining and attractive, with magnificent musical numbers and beautiful songs.
