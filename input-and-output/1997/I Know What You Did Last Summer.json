{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A year after running over a fisherman and dumping his body in the water, four friends reconvene when Julie (Jennifer Love Hewitt) receives a frightening letter telling her that their crime was seen. While pursuing who he thinks is responsible for the letter, Barry (Ryan Phillippe) is run over by a man with a meat hook. The bloodletting only increases from there, as the killer with the hook continues to stalk Julie, Helen (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and Ray (Freddie Prinze Jr.).", "rating": "43", "genre": "Horror", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Jim Gillespie", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 27, 2013", "box_office": "$72.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An '80s slasher in a '90s world that prioritizes its characters over gore and it's all the better for it.

It's directed better than a lot of the slasher films in recent years.", "The numerous false alarms, jump scares, frustratingly disbelieving supporting personas, and misdirections are admittedly amusing.", "For all its glaring flaws, I Know What You Did Last Summer has its fun with a loosely adapted story from the novel of the same name by Lois Duncan.", "Wastes more opportunities than it does teenagers.", "The performances by the young actors are engaging.", "A dreadful mad slasher film that works neither as a thriller nor as a comic commentary on the genre.", "All the scary, screaming, sniggering fun continues here, aided by swell performances from Hewitt and Gellar in particular... an appearance from the always groovy Anne Heche, and the crisp, crackerjack direction of Jim Gillespie.", "A poorly conceived 1997 thriller with plenty of empty references.", "A fresh look at the '80s-style slasher film, substituting characterization and suspense for the graphic violence and nudity that marked the earlier genre entries.", "Essentially, there's too much wandering around in search of the truth and not enough he's-behind-you stuff to keep the plot engine ticking, and the ending is a throwaway let-down.", "There are several effective moments... And the epilogue delivers a shock that'll fill your turn-ups with popcorn.", "Tthe frights come fairly regularly, and though the picture neither haunts nor tickles you the way Scream did, it's diverting enough as mindless Saturday-night entertainment.", "I Know What You Did Last Summer is gory enough for the devotees and has story enough for everyone else.", "Scream and the even better Scream 2 have intelligence, humor and an undercurrent of self-knowing satire that shows I Know What You Did... to be a passe bit of Hollywood formula.", "It doesn't live up to the hype it's received, but I Know What You Did Last Summer is still the best Halloween scare out there right now.", "From [Helen's chase scene] through the end, the film is perfection.", "Though efficiently made it's not a good film.", "[Director] Gillespie is there to give fans a poor man's \"Scream\" and he pulls it off.", "The story has more holes than the bodies do, but the shocks are efficient, and Party of Five's Jennifer Love Hewitt knows how to scream with soul."], "rating": ["5/5", "B-", "4/10", "3.5/5", "2/4", "2/4", "1/4", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "3/5", "3/4", "2.5/4", "", "", "C+", "", "B-"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Trace Thurman", "Chris Stuckmann", "Mike Massie", "C.H.
