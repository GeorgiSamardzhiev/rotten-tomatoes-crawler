{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Akira Kurosawa's lauded feudal epic presents the tale of a petty thief (Tatsuya Nakadai) who is recruited to impersonate Shingen (also Nakadai), an aging warlord, in order to avoid attacks by competing clans. When Shingen dies, his generals reluctantly agree to have the impostor take over as the powerful ruler. He soon begins to appreciate life as Shingen, but his commitment to the role is tested when he must lead his troops into battle against the forces of a rival warlord.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Art House & International/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h 40m", "director": "Akira Kurosawa", "studio": "20thCenturyFox", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 17, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Beyond the exquisite visual effects and battles, what is most interesting about the story is its protagonist: a double who turns into the shadow of the warrior Kagemusha.

But Kagemusha quite often switches on a dime to more deep and meaningful textures.", "Kagemusha, much like the similarly overblown but handsomely mounted Lawrence of Arabia, is an epic with a cipher in its point position.", "A fine example of the Kurosawa style...precision of narrative in both scripting and imagistic storytelling...
