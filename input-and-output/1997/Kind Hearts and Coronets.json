{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When his mother eloped with an Italian opera singer, Louis Mazzini (Dennis Price) was cut off from her aristocratic family. After the family refuses to let her be buried in the family mausoleum, Louis avenges his mother's death by attempting to murder every family member (all played by Alec Guinness) who stands between himself and the family fortune. But when he finds himself torn between his longtime love (Joan Greenwood) and the widow of one of his victims (Valerie Hobson), his plans go awry.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Robert Hamer", "studio": "EalingStudios", "theater_date": "Jun 14, 1950", "dvd_date": "Feb 14, 2016", "box_office": "$35.9K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The narration is splendidly wry and full of details, revealing dastardly intentions and acerbic observations.", "Drownings, explosions, and poisonings, their ethical status barely mentioned, let alone chastised, roll by like carriages in the park. The comedy is as black as widow's weeds. Artfulness is all.", "Dennis Price is a polite society murderer, and the sensational Alec Guinness is all eight of the aristocratic targets on his list.", "I keep wondering how the film manages to stay so light in spite of the notional black comedy of its plot. I think it has something to do with the sense of being out of time that I mentioned earlier: not timeless, but resistant to time.", "A diabolically clever comedy.", "As scathing a critique of the British upper classes as the cinema has ever given us, disguised as a light comedy with a charming exterior.", "Even the title, from a poem by Tennyson, is perfect. A bona fide treat.", "A lovely, intelligent and warm comedy about a man who will do anything to reclaim his birthright.", "This is an exceedingly funny film, scintillating with rapid witty dialogue by John Dighton and Robert Hamer, who has also directed with excellent taste.", "A high comedy that is enlivened with cynicism, loaded with dramatic irony and shot through with a suspicion of social satire.", "Shot through with pitch black humour and biting satire on both the moribund upper class and the grasping venality of the suburban middle class.", "Hamer had a particular liking for the late-Victorian/Edwardian world and was a great Francophile.", "Amazingly courageous for its day (1949) in combining bad taste with good comedy.", "", "", "This was Robert Hamer's masterpiece...", "Technically brilliant and savagely funny, serial killing has never looked so much fun.", "At once a witty comedy of manners, a grotesque serial-killer caper and an acerbic satire on the class system.", "Robert Hamer's poised direction chimes perfectly with his Edwardian setting, and the Wildean wit of Price's voice-over is an unfailing delight.", "A comedic gem featuring the incomparable Sir Alec Guinness."], "rating": ["9/10", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "5/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Anthony Lane", "Clyde Gilmour", "Michael Wood", "Matt Brunson", "Matthew Lucas", "Brian Viner", "Rob Aldam", "MFB Critics", "Patrick Gibbs", "Keir Roper-Caldbeck", "Philip French", "Derek Malcolm", "", "Anthony Quinn", "Peter Bradshaw", "Paul M.
