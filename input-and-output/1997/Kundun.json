{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1937, a two-and-a-half year old boy from a simple family in Tibet was recognized as the 14th reincarnation of the Buddha of Compassion, and destined to become the spiritual and political leader of his people. Director Martin Scorsese brings to the screen the true story of the Dalai Lama. Told through the eyes of His Holiness, \"Kundun\" brings to life the account of the Dalai Lama's early life, from childhood through the Chinese invasion of Tibet and his journey into exile.", "rating": "75", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h 14m", "director": "Martin Scorsese", "studio": "RefugeProductionsInc.,TouchstonePictures,DeFina-Cappa,WaltDisneyPictures", "theater_date": "Dec 6, 1997", "dvd_date": "Oct 13, 1998", "box_office": "$5.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Mesmerizing as visual pageantry but anemic when it comes to allowing access to this man or his religion.", "The effect is to make one feel as if one is seeing Tibet's recent history through the Dalai Lama's eyes.", "The film is, in many ways, a remarkable achievement but also a singularly undynamic entry in the director's canon.", "It's not exactly 'Goodfellas.' But it's not every filmmaker who can create works as divergent as 'Goodfellas' and 'Kundun,' either.", "Vigorously directed, sensual and hypnotic, Scorsese's film is a visually extraordinary meditation on ritual, nature and humanity.", "A challenging, thought provoking, mediative film that sits uncomfortably with Scorcese's previous work is helped no end by a superb score by Philip Glass.", "The music ties together all the pretty pictures, gives the narrative some momentum, and helps to induce a kind of alert detachment, so that you're neither especially interested nor especially bored.", "Scorsese has taken the harsh mystery out of Tibetan Buddhism, and out of its oppression, too.", "Scorsese's rich tableau of image and music bears a potent emotional weight.", "Kundun is surely the most gentle and meditative of Scorsese's films, a placid biography with the scope of an epic, the quality of a storybook, and the dramatic stakes of a tragedy.", "Disregarding commercial considerations, Scorsese's haunting meditation on Dalai Lama's early life is a majestic spectacle of images and sounds, but it's bogged down by a routine script that fails to offer fresh insights on Tibet's non-violent culture", "There's no denying the artistry of Kundun. Its heart also appears to be in the right place. But for those like me who don't have a versed history in the modern history of Tibet or Buddhism, the scope is ultimately too big.", "Urged on by Philip Glass's throbbing, blaring score, the director conjures a phenomenal, trance-like climax, owing more to dreams, second sight and the mind's eye than conventional dramatic rhetoric.", "Martin Scorcese has made a meditative, low key historical drama about a truly mystical figure of our modern history, departing from his usual, violence-prone flicks.", "Scorsese skillfully indulges his propensity for obsessive detail. Visually, the direction is varied and exhilarating", "Though a meditative, introspective film, Scorsese's distinctive techniques cause Kundun to pulse with life under its calm surface.", "", "All in all, Kundun is beautifully produced and honestly acted.", "Scorcese has made one of his best and most personal films.", "Kundun is original, moving, inspiring -- and one of the best movies of the year."], "rating": ["2.5/4", "", "3/4", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "C", "3.5/4", "", "B+", "", "", "B+", "3.5/4", "A-", "2.5/4", "4.5/5", "4/5", "4/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Matt Brunson", "Pico Iyer", "Mike Clark", "Jason Bailey", "Sandra Contreras", "", "David Edelstein", "Owen Gleiberman", "Michael Dequina", "Sean Axmaker", "Emanuel Levy", "Ryan Cracknell", "", "Robin Clifford", "Judith Egerton", "Carlo Cavagna", "Jeanne Aufmuth", "John R.
