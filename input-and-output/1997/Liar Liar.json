{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Conniving attorney Fletcher Reede (Jim Carrey) is an ace in the courtroom, but his dishonesty and devotion to work ruin his relationships. His wife, Audrey (Maura Tierney), has left him for a more dependable man, and Fletcher often breaks the commitments he makes to his beloved son, Max (Justin Cooper). When Max wishes his dad would stop lying for 24 hours, Fletcher suddenly finds that he can only speak the truth -- on the day his career-deciding court case has to be won.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 27m", "director": "Tom Shadyac", "studio": "UniversalPictures,ImagineEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 18, 2015", "box_office": "$181.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...a briskly-paced comedy that relies heavily on Carrey's unabashedly (and occasionally overbearingly) broad performance to propel the thin, overly familiar narrative forward...", "Jim Carrey is hilarious in this film", "One of the best comedies of the '90s and one of Carrey's most enduring (and endearing) works.", "Carrey, unique among American stars, doesn't need story or writing to delight. He needs only room, and \"Liar, Liar\" gives him plenty.", "Carrey fans the world over should rejoice at the squidgy-faced one's return to form -- this is quite possibly his best, most consistently funny film yet.", "Carrey's frenzied physical and vocal contortions provide lots of amusing comic moments, as well as a few riotous ones, and the role is not only tailor-made for his rubber-faced antics but also gives him an opportunity to show a more human side.", "Despite being way, way, way (way) over-the-top at times, Liar Liar is vintage Jim Carrey and a nice return to form. Honestly.", "This is essentially a one-joke movie, but it's a nifty joke.", "I would tell you that this is a loud, obvious, one-joke movie, but most of you would run out and pony up the eight bucks to see it anyway.", "Pretty funny, at least during those moments when it doesn't turn into goo.", "Carrey has never been better - that is to say funnier, or more controlled. He's reached a higher performance plateau here, playing a real human being we care about rather than a goon figure.", "Jim Carrey entertains himself mightily, and his enthusiasm is infectious.", "Carrey's mugging glosses over some tough issues.", "A sickly soft-swirl confection of low laughs and smarmy sentiment...", "A lot of fun, especially when Carrey reels off an entire lifetime's worth of driving offences to a nearby cop.", "Close to an ideal jumping-off point for Carrey, who spends the better part of an hour grotesquely physicalizing his scummy lawyer's struggle with being obliged to utter cold, hard facts.", "Pretty rudimentary, but it keeps Carrey's occasional over-exuberance in check and delivers likeable, effective, but decidedly mainstream comedy.", "Carrey truly works his *** off to get a laugh.", "A product that has nothing, zero, zip going for it besides the presence of its star.", "After a while, Jim Carey's character making a fool of himself is becoming annoying and the ultra-sentimental finale doesn't ring a little bit true."], "rating": ["2.5/4", "", "1", "3/4", "", "4/5", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "B", "2/5", "2/4", "", "", "", "3/4", "C-", "2/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Nusair", "Rachel Wagner", "Mike Massie", "Stephen Hunter", "Total Film Staff", "Jason Caro", "Stephen Carty", "Leah Rozen", "Paul Tatara", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Duane Byrge", "Owen Gleiberman", "Sarah Wenk", "Maitland McDonagh", "", "Todd McCarthy", "Geoff Andrew", "Michael Dequina", "Robin Clifford", "Dragan Antulov"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rachel&#39;s Reviews (YouTube)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Eye for Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNN.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieReport.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reeling Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rec.arts.movies.reviews"], "date": ["January 19, 2021", "October 11, 2020", "September 14, 2020", "April 7, 2020", "April 7, 2020", "April 7, 2020", "April 7, 2020", "April 7, 2020", "April 7, 2020", "April 7, 2020", "March 21, 2017", "September 7, 2011", "January 2, 2011", "December 14, 2008", "December 14, 2008", "November 21, 2008", "June 24, 2006", "September 18, 2005", "April 9, 2005", "January 16, 2004"]}}
