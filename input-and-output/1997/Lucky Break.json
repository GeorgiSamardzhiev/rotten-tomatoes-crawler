{"metadata": {"synopsis": "From the director of \"The Full Monty\" comes a comedy about a prison escape with a musical twist. Smalltime crook Jimmy (James Nesbitt) botches a bank robbery, lands in prison and stages a musical that turns out to be Act One of the perfect escape plan. But it's Act Two that's stumped Jimmy. His leading lady has captured his heart, and with one leg already over the wall, he's got to come up with a new ending ... as the curtain falls fast on his freedom.", "rating": "48", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Peter Cattaneo", "studio": "MiramaxFilms,FilmFourProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 1, 2018", "box_office": "$54.6K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "", "", "Well, this is definitely a disappointment.", "If you adored The Full Monty so resoundingly that you're dying to see the same old thing in a tired old setting, then this should keep you reasonably entertained.", "", "Overall, it's good, not great.
