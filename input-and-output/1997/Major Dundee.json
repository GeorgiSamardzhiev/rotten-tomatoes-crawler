{"metadata": {"synopsis": "During the end of the Civil War, Major Dundee guards Confederate prisoners, Union deserters and ordinary hard-bitten criminals in a remote fort. When Apaches attack the fort and make off with three children, Dundee must set up a posse including Confederates, who face a choice between joining up or being shot. The feud between Dundee and Tyreen is also heated up by a sultry Mexican widow.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Drama/Western", "runtime": "2h 4m", "director": "Sam Peckinpah", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 25, 2014", "box_office": "$14.9K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Despite the cuts which thin out the final stages of the story, and despite a flabby performance from Richard Harris which very nearly destroys the balance, the film is a fascinating study in the swing of a pendulum.", "So far these might seem familiar conventions, familiar characters.

This one is worth the return engagement.", "It's one of those flawed, fascinating films that are somehow more intriguing than many a smooth-cheeked blockbuster.", "No true Peckinpah-lover should pass it by.", "Major Dundee, not a great movie but a great star-driven, big budget 1965 studio western, is back in all its fractured glory and confidence.", "They don't make movies or movie directors like this anymore.", "It's richer and more interesting, partly because some motivations have been cleared up, partly because the music isn't a burden and partly because we now can see that this was all leading to the creation of a truly great film four years later.", "The new Dundee plugs some of the story holes but, sadly, it's still a plodding affair that's low on plausible character motivation and compelling action scenes.", "Testosterone Valhalla ... This newly restored version proves to be one of the most purely enjoyable, least thorny examples of [Peckinpah's] work.", "The restored version becomes a near masterpiece--a most powerful but fragmented western of epic proportions.", "Still a mess of great scenes sprinkled among some fairly monotonous action.
