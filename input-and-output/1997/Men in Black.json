{"metadata": {"synopsis": "They are the best-kept secret in the universe. Working for a highly funded yet unofficial government agency, Kay (Tommy Lee Jones) and Jay (Will Smith) are the Men in Black, providers of immigration services and regulators of all things alien on Earth. While investigating a series of unregistered close encounters, the MIB agents uncover the deadly plot of an intergalactic terrorist who is on a mission to assassinate two ambassadors from opposing galaxies currently in residence in New York City.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Barry Sonnenfeld", "studio": "ColumbiaPictures,MacDonald-Parkes,AmblinEntertainment", "theater_date": "Jul 4, 1997", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$250.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Choosing to go the route of puppets and primarily practical effects, the film's look remains striking, even after years of advancing computer graphics.", "The gremlins and the gadgets are the real stars of this show.", "A terrifically entertaining combination of alien conspiracy fears played for laughs and French Connection-meets-Ghostbusters thrills... Men in Black is so much fun one is actually mildly disappointed when it ends after an economically short 98 minutes.", "In addition to being uniquely and necessarily a creature of the second half of the 1990s, quite possibly the best popcorn movie of that half-decade.", "Men in Black is the rare breed of a sci-fi blockbuster that film audiences don't really get the opportunity to see anymore in theaters.", "Men in Black is the wryest, sharpest, most entertaining special effects film in recent memory, a simultaneous participant and mocking parody of the more-bang-for-your-buck behemoth genre.", "[Director Barry Sonnenfeld] establishes the premise in the wildly entertaining first 45 minutes and then glides along for the rest of the film on the strength of a poker-faced comic sensibility.", "What makes this wildly imaginative setup so much fun is the contrast between the deadpan gruffness of Jones and Torn, and the spectacularly strange environment in which they work.", "Men In Black deserves credit for supplementing its special effects with a breezy script and genuinely charismatic performances by Will Smith and Tommy Lee Jones.", "Men in Black, running a breezy 98 minutes, is a showpiece of laconic economy. It's quick, eccentric and deadly funny and for many young movie-goers it's likely to be a close encounter they'll want to see a second and third time.", "A lean, punchy, fast paced, and extremely endearing sci-fi action comedy.", "Its attitude is poised somewhere between the deadpan ghoulishness of the Coen brothers and a Letterman-like sense of the absurdity of life in New York's rich ethnic stew.", "Men in Black is moderately amusing, well-constructed and mercifully short, but it fails to deliver on the zaniness of its first half.", "Great special effects, inventive alien designs and Smith and Jones's hip, hilarious double act make director Barry Sonnenfeld's Lethal Weapon-style buddy picture a fast-paced pleasure.", "The plot, trifling as it is, doesn't much matter. What makes the movie such a hoot are the clever gags, imaginative special effects, and the snappy byplay between the well-matched Jones and Smith.", "There's a playfulness, here, that you don't often find in a special-effect flick.", "[A] hilarious comedy, directed with boisterous wit by Barry Sonnenfeld.", "A smart, funny and hip adventure film in a summer of car wrecks and explosions.", "Offensively bad? No. But it's never been anything more than a promising wasted opportunity.", "...an affable (yet somewhat forgettable) bit of escapist entertainment."], "rating": ["9/10", "3/5", "", "3.5/5", "5/5", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "4/5", "", "2.5/4", "4/5", "", "4/5", "3/4", "3.5/4", "2/4", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Leigh Paatsch", "David Hunter", "Tim Brayton", "Danielle Solzman", "Paul Tatara", "Michael Ollove", "Rod Dreher", "Stephen Thompson", "Dennis King", "", "Dave Kehr", "John Hartl", "Alan Jones", "Leah Rozen", "Jay Boyar", "David Sterritt", "Gene Siskel", "Dustin Putman", "David Nusair"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternate Ending", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Solzy at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNN.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheFilmFile.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews"], "date": ["September 14, 2020", "May 12, 2020", "July 2, 2019", "June 27, 2019", "June 11, 2019", "August 12, 2014", "August 12, 2014", "August 12, 2014", "August 12, 2014", "August 12, 2014", "August 12, 2014", "August 2, 2013", "July 31, 2013", "July 31, 2013", "July 31, 2013", "April 14, 2013", "April 14, 2013", "April 14, 2013", "May 24, 2012", "May 23, 2012"]}}
