{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When a cockroach-spread plague threatens to decimate the child population of New York City, evolutionary biologist Susan Tyler (Mira Sorvino) and her research associates rig up a species of \"Judas\" bugs and introduce them into the environment, where they will mimic the diseased roaches and infiltrate their grubby habitats. So far so good ... until the bugs keep on evolving and learn to mimic their next prey -- humans.", "rating": "64", "genre": "Horror/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Guillermo del Toro", "studio": "MiramaxFilms,DimensionFilms", "theater_date": "Aug 22, 1997", "dvd_date": "Oct 8, 2016", "box_office": "$25.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...a picture revolving around human-sized killer cockroaches should be less of a slog and much more fun than this.", "The atmospheric settings are the most spectacular elements, perfectly utilizing flickering tunnels, moist walkways, noisy air vents, and murky flashlight beams.", "It seems Del Toro was given free rein to rework the film AND share candidly about the process that forced him to compromise so much in his original theatrical version.", "Mimic will have entomophobes in the audience yearning to bug out, and scare-seekers squirming in their seats.", "A dark story that entertains with artistic moments until it fizzles as it becomes derivative of those standard sci-fi horror Big Bug films from the fifties.", "It comes off smarter and creepier than I recall the original, less about scares than a sustained atmosphere of eerie unease and skittery threats.", "Viewers will be forgiven for wanting to rush next door and douse their neighbor with RAID.", "While a visual treat, Mimic is exactly that, a film which mimics other styles and plot elements. In this case Alien and David Cronenberg's The Fly and Videodrome.", "It's clear now that Del Toro's favorite themes and symbols were already in place, with the vast underground setting, machinery, and man's interference in the supernatural order of things -- not to mention a talent for pure terror.", "Mimic: The Director's Cut on Blu-ray is a true gift for fans.", "", "Preposterous, yes, but a lot of fun.", "Fairly lame bug horror. Not del Toro's best, to put it mildly.", "Del Toro does not make Tyler a symbol of science gone out of control or of science for greed, instead he makes her a scientist who in doing good has created a monster and has to live with that guilt.", "Del Toro consegue criar alguns bons momentos de tens\u00e3o e o filme conta com um design de produ\u00e7\u00e3o bastante acima da m\u00e9dia para exemplares do g\u00eanero.
