{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This loosely plotted coming-of-age tale follows the life of 15-year-old Laurent Chevalier (Beno\u00eet Ferreux) as he stumbles his way over the burgeoning swell of adolescence in 1950s France. After having his first sexual experience with a prostitute and dodging the lips of a priest (Michel Lonsdale), Chevalier contracts a case of scarlet fever. When the fever leaves him with a heart murmur, Chevalier is placed in a sanatorium, along with his over-attentive and adulterous mother (L\u00e9a Massari).", "rating": "94", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 58m", "director": "Louis Malle", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 28, 2006", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It casts a fresh, vigorous and unclouded eye on adolescence as it really is rather than as we would like it to be.", "The theme is treated with faultless discretion and taste, without the smallest nod to current sensationalism.", "Malle, as I see it, is saying: to understand today you must appreciate yesterday.
