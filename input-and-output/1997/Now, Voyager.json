{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Boston heiress Charlotte Vale (Bette Davis) is a neurotic mess, largely because of her domineering mother (Gladys Cooper). But after a stint in a sanatorium where she receives the attention of Dr. Jasquith (Claude Rains), Charlotte comes out of her shell and elects to go on a cruise. Aboard ship she meets Jerry (Paul Henreid) and falls in love, despite his being married. They enjoy a brief tryst in Rio before returning to the States, where Charlotte struggles to forget him and find happiness.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 57m", "director": "Irving Rapper", "studio": "WarnerBrothers", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Bette Davis, as the neurotic daughter, Claude Rains, the doctor, and Paul Henreid, combine to make a fine production.", "It may be a standard tale of forbidden romance, but it dwells on an uncommon twosome; these past-their-prime souls aren't the typical fare for a melodramatic love yarn.", "Tender, poignant and lusciously calibrated by Rapper, Now, Voyager is one of the few romantic melodramas which manages a timelessness due to its almost accidental universality.", "...a part that's perfect for Davis, which makes it odd that Now, Voyager feels the need to do so much of the work for her.", "Davis' performance anchors [the story], preventing it from flying off into the realm of camp, turning an outlandish story into one painfully human and universal.", "the emotional resonance of Charlotte and Tina's surrogate mother-daughter connection is so strong that the film's plot contrivances are easy to forgive", "Now, Voyager contains one classic image and one classic line of dialogue. As for the rest? It's soap opera par excellence.", "It's one of the better 'women pictures,' though it got too weepie, mushy and full of itself for me.", "A superlative, juicy mother-daughter melodrama with top notch performance from Bette Davis, at the top of her form, and the rest of the cast.", "Lots of appeal for highly romantic teens.", "If you can resist Bette Davis in fat suit, hideous dress, and monobrow, you're not as gay as you think you are. I guess I kind of liked it.", "It's all far more complicated than it needs to be, but then again, what would you cut?", "Compulsively watchable four-hankie weepie.", "", "", "Classic to the max, and with Davis, Henried, and those two cigarettes.", "Now, Voyager remains a highly narcotic, swoon-inducing romance in the Bette Davis canon.", "...romantic and romanticized, sudsy and sentimental...a throwback to an earlier age in Hollywood when movies didn't have to be loud or vulgar to sell a point.", "", ""], "rating": ["", "1", "4/5", "2.5/4", "9/10", "3/4", "3.5/4", "B", "A-", "5/5", "2.5/4", "3.5/5", "", "4/5", "5/5", "5/5", "3/4", "7/10", "5/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Age Staff", "Mike Massie", "Nicholas Bell", "Josh Larsen", "Nathanael Hood", "James Kendrick", "Matt Brunson", "Dennis Schwartz", "Emanuel Levy", "Nell Minow", "Walter Chaw", "David Cornelius", "Jeffrey M.
