{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The quiet life of small-town gas station owner Jeff Bailey (Robert Mitchum) is interrupted when a figure from his shady past, small-time crook Joe Stephanos (Paul Valentine), recognizes him. Stephanos' boss, crooked gambler Whit Sterling (Kirk Douglas), had hired Jeff to track down Kathie Moffat (Jane Greer), a girlfriend who shot Whit and made off with $40,000 of his. Jeff and Kathie fell in love, but she left him to go back to Sterling, who now wants Jeff to settle a few old scores.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Jacques Tourneur", "studio": "RKORadioPicturesInc.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 1, 2009", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Out of the Past permits the viewer to experience both the immediate drama ... and, at the same time, recognize the presence, which shines through the imagery, of another, even more resonant level of meaning.", "An archetypal film noir featuring bright white lights, extra dark shadows, heavy rain, perpetually lit cigarettes, and a generous portion of flashback storytelling.", "[Jacques] Tourneur's pacing and tempo is flawless, and [Robert] Mitchum in a trench coat and full of taciturn machismo is on par with Bogie, who owned the trademark.", "The players acquit themselves histrionically if not morally. Mitchum, [Kirk] Douglas and the Misses [Jane] Greer and [Rhonda] Fleming are all commendable.", "As an antidote to post-prandial lethargy it will do yeoman service...", "Fairly well played, and very well photographed (by Nicholas Musuraca), the action develops a routine kind of pseudo-tension.", "Essential viewing for the noir fan and the kind of movie that could make a neutral third party into a noir fan in the first place.", "In a genre full of desperate characters scrambling and plotting to grab their slice of the American dream, Jacques Tourneur's Out of the Past (1947) is a hard-boiled tale of betrayal with an unusually haunting quality.", "Out Of The Past is undeniably a film noir, and rightly regarded as one of the genre's best.", "'Maybe we thought the world would end,' Mitchum muses, during a short-lived spell of happiness in Mexico. 'Maybe we thought it was a dream.' A dream? In his trench coat and fedora, he's clearly not a man destined to die quietly in his bed.", "Each change of angle and shift of light evokes an inner disturbance; the actors seem to push through the dense shadow as through water, revealing fast people in slow motion ...", "[VIDEO ESSAY] One of the best-loved '40s era contributions to the film noir genre, Director Jacques Tourneur's \"Out of the Past\" (1947) is a definitive model.", "Few films noir were better than this.", "Jacques Tourneuer's most accomplished film and a great sampler of film noir, sort of a textbook both visually and thematically.", "Out of the Past should be considered a prototypical example of how to do noir the right way--shadowy corners, double crossings aplenty, a luscious femme fatale, and, of course, murders.", "What makes \"Out of the Past\" stand out among the film noir classics is that it has better actors, a better screenplay and it doesn't look like it was made on the cheap.", "Beautiful thriller, with haunting direction.", "Direction by Jacques Tourneur pays close attention to mood development, achieving realistic flavor that is further emphasized by real life settings and topnotch lensing by Nicholas Musuraca.", "The most delicate and nuanced of film noirs, graced with a reflective lyricism that almost lifts it out of the genre.", ""], "rating": ["", "1", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "9/10", "", "5/5", "4/4", "", "A+", "3.5/4", "A-", "8", "A", "", "", "", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Mike Massie", "Tom Meek", "Philip K.
