{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this musical based on the Broadway show, Ben Rumson (Lee Marvin) happens upon a wrecked wagon containing a dead man and his surviving brother, Pardner (Clint Eastwood), in the wilds of California during the Gold Rush. At the burial, they discover gold dust and stake a claim. Soon a mining camp dubbed \"No Name City\" emerges, rife with lonely men starved for female companionship. When a polygamist Mormon arrives looking to sell off a wife (Jean Seberg), a bidding war commences.", "rating": "27", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Musical & Performing Arts/Western/Romance", "runtime": "2h 38m", "director": "Joshua Logan", "studio": "ParamountPictures,MalpasoCompany", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A mess, to be certain, but a happy and unpretentious mess that rambles along with a reckless charm.", "Logan's movie is a flop on many levels, a musical in which America's most macho actors, Clint Eastwood and Lee Marvin, are miscast and required to sing.", "The pic just collapses because there's nothing going on that matters except to watch Marvin's hammy performance.", "This last gasp MGM musical still features enough curiousity to make it worthwhile.", "", "", "", "", "The fact is, Paint Your Wagon doesn't inspire a review.
