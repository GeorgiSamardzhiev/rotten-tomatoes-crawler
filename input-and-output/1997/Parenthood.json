{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Perfectionist Gil Buckman (Steve Martin) struggles with the deficiencies of his children, thinking they reflect poorly on his parenting -- and Gil's siblings only add to the stress of his life. One of his sisters (Dianne Wiest) faces difficulty when her teenage daughter (Martha Plimpton) becomes pregnant. Another (Harley Jane Kozak) clashes with her husband (Rick Moranis) when she asks for more children. Gil's immature brother (Tom Hulce) turns up as well, with a young son he can barely handle.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "2h 4m", "director": "Ron Howard", "studio": "ImageEntertainmentInc.,UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 15, 2012", "box_office": "$99.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Plenty of realistic drama makes its way into the slightly exaggerated scenarios.", "...an engaging and often engrossing picture that benefits substantially from the efforts of a uniformly superb cast...", "The glorification of fatherhood in today's films combined with the portrayal of women in the same movies as little more than breeding machines... is a treason against active motherhood and an attack on women who choose not to have children.", "A feel-good sitcom about three generations of middle-class California suburban dwelling parents trying to deal with their vexing children as they experience growing pains.", "It's hard to imagine a theme more universal and filled with human pitfalls than parenthood. And it's hard to imagine a movie treatment of that theme more humane and filled with gentle sympathy than director Ron Howard's Parenthood.", "Ambitiously probing every anxiety-ridden corner of the suburban mum-and-dad experience, some of its interconnecting story strands work better than others.", "Parenthood gets a lot of emotional mileage out of kiddie antics, but Howard has, thankfully, given us a little more.", "The fulcrum of the film is Martin. It's an adventurous and successful stroke of casting that takes advantage of what the audience expects from him.", "As Parenthood reveals within its charming, two-hour running time, the pitfalls and quandaries of child-rearing are universal -- and the joys and the heartaches remain lifelong concerns.", "This feel-good family ensemble piece from director Ron Howard manages to avoid being oversentimental, and the result is an affectionate, leisurely comedy about the joys (and otherwise) of bringing up children.", "There are good jokes and funny observations about middle-class life. The picture is too long and predictable, though.", "This movie has its share of laughs, but it's also Ron Howard's most personal film, and clearly his most ambitious.", "Here is a comedy that treats the problems and delights of real life with respect, insight, warmth and remarkably sustained wit.", "Parenthood easily could have focused exclusively on yuppie parents and their kids; however, the script by Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel is more sophisticated than that, remembering that every parent is still a child too.", "The remaining cast, young, old and in-between, is lovely.", "With Parenthood, Howard as a director has discovered weight, but not gravity. For all of its admirable seriousness, the film finally floats away.", "There's not a scene in Parenthood that isn't involving: The actors keep reaching into themselves and coming up with gold.", "Poignant family dramedy with lots of adult themes.", "Howard juggles all the characters effortlessly, showcasing troubles left and right without losing the film to gloom. It's nimble work, blessed with a cast that knows exactly what they're reaching for in their performances.", "There is something brave and original about piling up most of our worst parental nightmares in one movie and then daring to make a midsummer comedy out of them. It really shouldn't work, but it does."], "rating": ["7/10", "3.5/4", "", "B-", "5/5", "4/5", "3/4", "3/4", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "2/4", "", "4/5", "B+", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "David Nusair", "Kathi Maio", "Dennis Schwartz", "Dennis King", "Paul M.
