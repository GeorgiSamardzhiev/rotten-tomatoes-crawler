But his secret is exposed when a colleague spots the illness's telltale lesions. Fired shortly afterwards, Beckett resolves to sue for discrimination, teaming up with Joe Miller (Denzel Washington), the only lawyer willing to help. In court, they face one of his ex-employer's top litigators, Belinda Conine (Mary Steenburgen).", "rating": "80", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 5m", "director": "Jonathan Demme", "studio": "ClinicaEstetico,TriStarPictures", "theater_date": "Dec 22, 1993", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$76.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Every actor's contribution to the film is noteworthy, especially when Demme chooses to bestir them with intrusive camera angles and lingering scenes of emotional poignancy.", "Filmmaker Jonathan Demme does an absolutely superlative job of establishing the film's various characters and their urban environs...", "An important film not just from a cinematic perspective, but from a cultural one, bringing the AIDS crisis to the masses in a deeply human way, confronting and dispelling prejudices and misconceptions with major stars.", "Hanks and Washington (in a role that's unexpectedly comic) have rarely been better and use their considerable star power to obscure some of the movie's flaws.", "Philadelphia, apart from having talented actors delivering remarkable performances, is a piece of history that anyone with a heart and a sense of justice can understand.", "Sparks of acting brilliance rescue the cautious, sometimes craven script, as does Demme's inventive direction. Though the plotting reeks of safety-first commercialism, the camerawork has the dangerous intimacy of independent film-making.", "Jonathan Demme's thoughtful human drama was certainly not the first movie to confront the AIDS crisis, but it was, even in the conventional skin of a courtroom drama, the most heartbreaking and passionate undertaking of its kind.", "Philadelphia may not be the film Demme's fans expect--its emotionalism is unfiltered by cool. But it has the power to open more than a few blinkered hearts.", "What remains most striking about Philadelphia may be the...conspicuous emphasis on intense close-ups. They force an inescapable emotional intimacy in relation to issues the mainstream, at least at the time, would rather have looked away from.
