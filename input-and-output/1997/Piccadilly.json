Piccadilly was lavishly praised by the critics. The public looked as though they paid money to see it. I thought it was one of the world's worst.", "It is rare, as here, to wish for more captions, but one would give a great deal for words from [screenwriter Arnold] Bennett which might enliven these waste lands.", "Dupont's stunning evocation of London's roaring twenties would be of cinematic interest even without Wong; but her sultry presence makes this backstage melodrama a must-see.", "Dupont has an original way of employing camera movement to suggest erotic chemistry between characters, and Wong, who even provoked a rave notice from Walter Benjamin, is as memorable and confident as Louise Brooks was in the films of G.W. Pabst.", "Like most English pictures, the drama is crudely shaped and conventionally directed. Anna May Wong does the best acting.", "Music is the usual medley of pop dance stuff, with the cabaret set about the best thing in the production. Camerawork on close-ups is excellent.", "Perhaps the greatest asset of Piccadilly comes from the camera. Mr. Dupont is noted for his unusual touches, and he has not spared them in this production.", "The melodramatic machinations of the plot may be weak, but Dupont's assured direction, Alfred J\u00fcnge's art direction, and Werner Brandes' lighting create an atmosphere so hauntingly evocative as to be satisfying in itself.", "This crime melodrama, atmospherically designed by Alfred Junge, was much admired in its day as a stylish piece of work. Now, though, its old-fashioned acting is more likely to cause giggles.", "", "One of the overlooked great classic silent films.", "It's difficult to imagine a Hollywood production allowing an Asian star to be as commanding as Wong is in Piccadilly.", "Dupont transforms the stuff of melodrama into a compelling tragedy of passion with a theme of racial injustice and exploitation.", "If you need evidence of why Anna May Wong was a star in the boon days of cinema, and should have been an even bigger one, look no further than 1929's Piccadilly", "A drama of sexual and racial politics set against the buzz of jazz-age London culture, Piccadilly is an incredibly modern silent film featuring a career-best performance from Anna May Wong.", "A swinging London club; the breakup of a famous performing couple; a well-known dancer being replaced by one younger and more exotic; a murder. All juicy fodder for plot, and it's a good thing.", "[Wong's] role of Shosho, the red-hot dancing star of London's Piccadilly nightclub, shows her at her dramatic and erotic peak.", "A sophisticated exploration of racial and sexual taboos.", "Wong is the kind of gorgeous that burns right through a camera lens, and the kind of mesmerizing that seems without effort or end.", "[Wong] is not top billed, but her entrance in Piccadilly -- and her general presence -- make her the star."], "rating": ["", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "", "", "2/5", "2/5", "A", "3/4", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "4/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Hugh Castle", "Times (UK) Staff", "Robert Pardi", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "TIME Staff", "Variety Staff", "Mordaunt Hall", "Robert Murphy", "Robin Karney", "Emanuel Levy", "Dennis Schwartz", "Ed Gonzalez", "Kevin Thomas", "Ken Eisner", "Laura Bushell", "Marta Barber", "Michael Wilmington", "James Verniere", "Janice Page", "Jeffrey M.
