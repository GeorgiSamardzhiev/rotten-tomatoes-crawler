{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A young wife comes to believe that her offspring is not of this world. Waifish Rosemary Woodhouse (Mia Farrow) and her struggling actor husband Guy (John Cassavetes) move to a New York City apartment building with an ominous reputation and odd neighbors Roman and Minnie Castavet (Sidney Blackmer, Ruth Gordon).

Involvement is absent; all is surface and it is a smooth one, without the shimmer of the evil that is within.", "Polanski is less interested in terror and shock than in creating a mood of paranoia and instability. He finds the eerie in the mundane...", "One of the best-shot, best-scored, and best-acted supernatural thrillers ever made.", "Right to its bitter end, there is no escaping \"Rosemary's Baby.\" On film Ira Levin's best selling novel is as horribly frightening as it was on paper.", "A Ross Hunter-type gloss cannily deformed by anxiety and the gnomish grins of familiar Hollywood faces", "Rosemary's Baby is suffused with Polanski's style and preoccupations.", "It's one of the most powerful films ever made about Devil worship because Polanski expertly winds up the paranoia with spooky atmospherics and morbid humour.", "A terrifying thriller that is held up by its incredible ensemble cast, and all too logical premise.", "So long as there are men in power who are still fuzzy on the definition of rape, Rosemary's Baby will endure as a cautionary tale.", "Mia Farrow excels as the pretty young thing who suspects she's carrying the spawn of Satan, but it's Polanski who emerges as the real star.", "'Rosemary's Baby' presents the dark and the light and allows for choice: does she or doesn't she?", "A spellbinding horror film from Roman Polanski.", "Four decades later, Polanski's supremely mounted horror thriller holds up extremely well.", "...a bona fide classic of the horror genre...", "Keep children away from this scary classic.", "Even readers of the book who know how Baby comes out are in for a pleasant surprise: the very real acting ability of Mia Farrow."], "rating": ["", "7/10", "", "", "", "", "9/10", "", "", "A", "5/5", "", "4/4", "5/5", "", "4/4", "A", "3.5/4", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "Mike Massie", "Gene Youngblood", "Stephen Farber", "Judith Crist", "Sean Axmaker", "Tim Brayton", "Kathleen Carroll", "Fernando F.
