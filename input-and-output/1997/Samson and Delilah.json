For all its unsparing, quietly condemning look at Australia's treatment of Aborigines today, it ends on a grace note of devotion and tender care.", "Director Warwick Thornton's artistic choices alienated me as viewer and made me pray for the end.", "Spare and beautiful, Samson & Delilah gives viewers a peephole into two characters' struggle in a corner of the earth not visited enough on film.", "This lovely, aching film opts for romance in the face of modern ruin.", "This sterling 2009 debut by Warwick Thornton is harrowing and tragic but has a stoic, stately realism that elevates the material way above victim politics.", "There's little dialogue in Samson and Delilah and the film has a gritty, sun-baked poeticism to it.", "The film may be hard as hell to watch, but it's even harder to look away from.", "Thornton's grip on familiar narrative tropes comes to more and more resemble a choke-hold up until the film's lovely final moments", "Thornton isn't concerned about filling in the lines, requiring viewers to make the connections for themselves. The film is all the more engaging for it.", "A poetic, tender and unflinchingly real love story. Its powerful visuals, music and raw, captivating performances will leave you feeling deeply moved.", "How do you know you're looking at a pretty good piece of filmmaking? When the director and actors can make you care about the central characters even though they exchange almost no dialogue.", "The actors succeed at portraying a couple whose bond is strong enough to not require words.", "Pitched somewhere between City Of God and the Dardenne brothers, Samson And Delilah is unsparing in its brutal vision of the world.", "Thornton's modest little story about two indigenous teens had been hailed as ground zero for a glorious new wave in Australian cinema. For once, the hyperbole seems justified...", "The spiritual here is every bit as powerful as the physical.", "A unstinting look at the social outcasts of Australian society made by a member of aboriginal society, its grim narrative punctuated by off-kilter humor in a minimalist style.", "Director/writer Warwick Thornton makes the mistake that hobbles too many new filmmakers: an overindulgence on arresting visuals but a deficit of compelling storytelling."], "rating": ["3.5/5", "", "", "", "2/5", "", "B+", "", "", "3/4", "2.5/5", "", "9.0/10", "3/4", "3/4", "A-", "4/5", "", "", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Harris", "Kate Rodger", "Sarah Ward", "Brian Gibson", "Adam Ross", "Sarah Sluis", "Tom Long", "Cliff Doerksen", "Beth Accomando", "Michael O&#39;Sullivan", "Chris Cabin", "Annlee Ellingson", "Avi Offer", "Neil Genzlinger", "Ethan Alter", "Sam Adams", "David Fear", "Andrew Schenker", "Louis Proyect", "Phil Hall"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newshub (NZ)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flicks.com.au", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Alberta)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Aristocrat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Journal International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Detroit News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KPBS.org", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmcritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Moving Pictures Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">NYC Movie Guru", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">NYC Film Critic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Village Voice", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rec.arts.movies.reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat"], "date": ["October 29, 2019", "September 7, 2019", "July 29, 2018", "May 6, 2013", "September 29, 2012", "August 15, 2011", "February 25, 2011", "January 4, 2011", "December 10, 2010", "November 19, 2010", "October 21, 2010", "October 19, 2010", "October 18, 2010", "October 15, 2010", "October 14, 2010", "October 14, 2010", "October 13, 2010", "October 12, 2010", "October 11, 2010", "October 10, 2010"]}}
