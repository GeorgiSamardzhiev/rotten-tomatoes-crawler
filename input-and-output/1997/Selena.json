{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this biographical drama, Selena Quintanilla (Jennifer Lopez) is born into a musical Mexican-American family in Texas. Her father, Abraham (Edward James Olmos), realizes that his young daughter is talented and begins performing with her at small venues. She finds success and falls for her guitarist, Chris Perez (Jon Seda), who draws the ire of her father. Seeking mainstream stardom, Selena begins recording an English-language album which, tragically, she would never complete.", "rating": "65", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 7m", "director": "Gregory Nava", "studio": "QFilmProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 1, 2008", "box_office": "$35.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It captures the appeal of Selena singing and Lopez shines in those scenes.", "It's hard to get too cynical about the approach taken by Selena.", "It tries to satisfy too many different groups at once and ends up watering down the art so much it satisfies no one.", "Writer-director Gregory Nava... relates the singer's story on a touchingly human scale, particularly focusing on the father-daughter dynamic.", "Gregory Nava's 1997 biopic about the Mexican-American pop star Selena Quintanilla Perez... is typical of the genre's excesses, but I enjoyed quite a bit of it, in large part because of the energy and charisma of Jennifer Lopez in the title role.", "J-Lo does a phenomenal job...but I want to see the real Selena story, not one written by her parents...", "The last five minutes are amazing...J-Lo looked great, the acting is solid, it's just a bit too long...", "What makes this movie work is Jennifer Lopez's electric performance as Selena, capturing the charismatic aspects of Selena's stage persona and the essence of her maturity as a growing woman.", "When it doesn't, however - when Selena teeters precariously in the direction of hagiography and buckles under the weight of representing all Latinas to all people - then the real young woman herself is hard to find.", "... Lopez's presence and ability made her seem just one role away from stardom, and with \"Selena\" she's seized the opportunity and turned in an incandescent presentation that is especially strong during the film's numerous musical numbers.", "At its best, \"Selena\" suggests why so many people reacted with such great heartbreak to her death.", "Selena surmounts its connect-the-dots approach to its heroine's life to create an appealing, energetic look at a too-briefly soaring musical star.", "Jennifer Lopez ... elevates the film immensely with her radiant and energetic performance.", "A well-meaning but bland and shallow salute to Selena.", "What a biography. And what a screenplay.", "Even in its sappiest moments, Jennifer Lopez's performance and Selena's music shine through.", "In spite of Jennifer Lopez' strong performance, it doesn't save an incomplete story that only covers some of Selena's life.", "In her first major, star-making role, Jennifer Lopez is compelling, but the rest of this showbiz biopic is shallow and excessively melodramatic, like most of Gregory Nava's films.", "Lopez's commanding presence makes up for any of the script's shortcomings.", ""], "rating": ["7/10", "2.5/4", "", "2.5/4", "", "3/5", "4/5", "", "B-", "", "", "", "", "6", "3.5/5", "3/5", "3/5", "C+", "3/4", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Rachel Wagner", "Matt Brunson", "Sarah Kerr", "Dennis King", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Justin Brown", "Brandon Collins", "Duane Byrge", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Kenneth Turan", "Richard Harrington", "Todd McCarthy", "Felix Gonzalez Jr.", "Brian Webster", "Don Willmott", "Felix Gonzalez Jr.", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Emanuel Levy", "Michael Dequina", "Thomas Delapa"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Frenzy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slate", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Medium Popcorn", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Medium Popcorn", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">DVD Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Apollo Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmcritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">DVD Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieReport.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boulder Weekly"], "date": ["January 20, 2021", "June 14, 2020", "February 27, 2020", "February 27, 2020", "February 27, 2020", "September 20, 2018", "September 20, 2018", "March 21, 2017", "September 7, 2011", "July 6, 2010", "July 6, 2010", "March 27, 2009", "September 28, 2007", "September 17, 2007", "September 14, 2007", "September 5, 2007", "July 13, 2007", "February 3, 2007", "September 18, 2005", "May 19, 2005"]}}
