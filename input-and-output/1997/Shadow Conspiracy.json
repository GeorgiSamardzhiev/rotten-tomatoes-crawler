Like a zombie who's spent too much time in the gym, he blunders heavily from one stunt to the next, his pursed lips conveying nothing more than pique.", "", "", "The climactic assassination attempt... is so ridiculous there's only one real danger: that the president (and the audience) will laugh to death.", "", "The story's driven completely by coincidence and baffling lunacy, and you'll be driven... to press eject on your VCR.", "Ridiculous.", "The film is so contemptuous of its audience it doesn't even bother to present a surface resemblance to reality.", "The whole thing is so vague and preposterous and paranoid that it almost goes without saying that Donald Sutherland plays a key role.", "", "Sheen is a handsome and resourceful actor, but not enough so to win in this conspiracy of shadows over substance.", "When Charlie Sheen and Donald Sutherland appear in any movie, you should be wary.
