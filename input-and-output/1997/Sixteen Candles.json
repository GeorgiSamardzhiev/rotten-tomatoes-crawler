{"metadata": {"synopsis": "With the occasion all but overshadowed by her sister's upcoming wedding, angst-ridden Samantha (Molly Ringwald) faces her 16th birthday with typical adolescent dread. Samantha pines for studly older boy Jake (Michael Schoeffling), but worries that her chastity will be a turnoff for the popular senior. Meanwhile, Samantha must constantly rebuff the affections of nerdy Ted (Anthony Michael Hall), the only boy in the school, unfortunately, who seems to take an interest in her.", "rating": "84", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "John Hughes", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 15, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Sixteen Candles is a genuinely funny film with plenty of throwaway gags that betray Hughes' Lampoon origins.", "At times it's laugh-out-loud funny, highlighting the awkwardness of adolescence through alternations of clumsiness, low self-esteem, and misadventures of maturation.", "Meandering and kind of dull and doesn't quite manage to be as sweet as its romantic final scene.", "To try to explain Sixteen Candles as a person who was there for it in first run today is to helplessly shrug and say, 'I don't know, man, it was a different time.'", "Watch with compassion.", "Sixteen Candles is a genuinely funny and touching coming-of-age story.", "High school is high school no matter what the date, and Hughes ensures that the constancies of that age remain unchanged.", "The plotting is crude and haphazard, but the dialogue is amusing and the cast is appealing.", "...a sporadically amusing yet hopelessly uneven endeavor that simply isn't in the same league as Hughes' later classics.", "A high school film just smart enough to be special and bad enough that it could be improved upon.", "Racy, drunken, hilarious '80s high school comedy.", "Candles is a brazenly mischievous, consistently uproarious comedy that christens the devastating Hughes-fu with vivacious results.", "", "", "There's also a darkly handsome high school heartbreak kid (Michael Schoeffling), a merciful brisk pace, some quick humor (visual and verbal), and a solid music track.", "This funny, unpretentious film marked writer John Hughes's first time out as a director.
