But there is a bit too much of Godzilla in the monster when it finally is revealed in all of its ghastly glory.", "A derivative and predictable post-Alien sci-fi horror film.", "A surprisingly entertaining \"monster-on-the-loose\" picture set mostly in halls and private passageways of Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History.", "No doubt the bill for Energizers alone took up a big chunk of this gory clunker's $48-million budget.", "The story comes from a million other movies (mainly Jaws and Alien), and it's completely and totally predictable.", "A slick, witty, and unexpectedly effective little genre throwback.", "Though based on an original and respected novel, Hyams' horror thriller comes across as a pastiche of the genre's conventions as evident in major pictures of the past two decades, such as Jaws and the first two Alien films.", "", "A terrific monster movie with an edge.
