Working in English for the first time, with Francis Coppola as her executive producer, Agnieszka Holland conjures up a fairy-tale world of images...", "The film has charm, without wandering into the realm of magic.", "The result is an instant classic -- rich, dense, resonant, powerful.", "While drawing superb performances from her young leads, Holland has masterfully contrasted the garden -- a place where melodic robins seem almost conversant -- with the dread of Misselthwaite.", "The film retains the gothic atmosphere of the book and looks amazing, thanks to Roger Deakins's scintillating photography. Stealing the show is Maggie Smith as beastly housekeeper Mrs Medlock.", "That`s a more upscale marketing concept than Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but it still doesn't make the movie any good.", "The movie's dark themes, unhurried pace and talkiness make it something of a gamble for many children. But older children -- especially those who have been asking specific questions about death -- may find some nourishment in this garden.", "This enchanted tale vividly shows how love heals and nurtures barren souls, makes them flourish like abundant Edens.", "Rather than a fresh breeze, it's the stale air of gilded calculation, the uncomfortable feeling that things are excessively \"just so,\" that overhangs much that is genuinely appealing about this film.", "Though it can get laborious, and produces the odd unintended chuckle, The Secret Garden is charming and sometimes chillingly authentic.", "Any kids' movie that aims for something richer than the Saturday-matinee escapism of smiling whales and preschool ninjas -- that actually captures some of the mystery of childhood -- ought to be embraced. whatever its peculiarities.", "It's as if the moviemakers were trying to cook up a New Age Yorkshire pudding, without meat drippings -- what's missing is Burnett's robust optimism and animistic energy.", "What magic there is comes from the odd, ritual behaviour of the children in a nice demonstration of the life-enhancing miracle of nature.", "This lavish treatment originated from Coppola's Zoetrope studio and follows their several successful films made for family audiences.", "An intelligently conceived and finely crafted picture with a G rating, a tag normally shunned by ambitious filmmakers because of its association with kiddie cartoons and squeaky-clean dullness.", "Screenwriter Caroline Thompson and director Agnieszka Holland have turned Frances Hodgson Burnett's rather gothic 1911 children's book into an evocative, beautifully realized picture.", "The film is gorgeous to look at, from its period accouterments to its wanderings in explored space (the house is full of secret passageways) to its use of color.", "The movie enchants, with a visual texture that clearly bears the mark of executive producer Francis Ford Coppola and confirms the arrival of Oscar-nominated Polish director Agnieszka Holland.", "Great book, great adaptation.", "Executed to near perfection in all artistic departments, this superior adaptation of the perennial favorite novel will find its core public among girls , but should prove satisfying enough to a range of audiences."], "rating": ["", "", "", "3.5/4", "4/5", "", "3/5", "3.5/4", "", "3/4", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Brian D.
