{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Media mogul Elliot Carver (Jonathan Pryce) wants his news empire to reach every country on the globe, but the Chinese government will not allow him to broadcast there. Carver doesn't take no for an answer and plans to use his media empire to fuel flames of war between the Western world and China. Thankfully, James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is on to the insane news tycoon and travels to China to stop him with the help of Chinese secret agent Wai Lin (Michelle Yeoh).", "rating": "57", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "Roger Spottiswoode", "studio": "UnitedArtists,DanjaqProductions", "theater_date": "Dec 19, 1997", "dvd_date": "Oct 1, 2016", "box_office": "$145.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The action sequences are routinely stupendous, even if the storyline is enormously unmemorable.", "How do you top Goldeneye? Unfortunately not with this effort.", "Tomorrow Never Dies falls more towards the average thanks to a thin plot and an entertaining but extremely plain villain. Not bad, not great, just... fine.", "It's really just a techno-action movie (and a crap one at that) paying lipservice to the conventions of the Bond movie.", "As Bonds go, though, Tomorrow Never Dies is pleasant enough brain candy, although Brosnan's efforts deserve better... maybe next time, Meester Bond.", "[Director Roger] Spottiswoode serves up a glutinous mix of pastiche and parody, without seeming to know whether he's recycling or debunking his cliches.", "Despite the film's faults, David Arnold's score, which layers industrialised sounds over traditional orchestration, can make some sequences seem more exciting than they actually are.", "Brosnan gives it his best and with Yeoh, he's got a capable dance partner, but this 007 edition felt like a retread story that was already old news.", "Tomorrow Never Dies is as overproduced as one of Carver's cable broadcasts -- incredibly noisy, flashy and busy without being terribly exciting.", "Flaws aside, this was at the time the best Bond movie since the heyday of Mr Connery.", "After weeks of media bombardment with Tomorrow Never Dies product tie-in commercials, it's clear that the studio and the film's producers have reinvented movie promotion. Now they need to focus their efforts on reinventing the Bond movies.", "From the carnage of a troubled shoot emerged Brosnan's best Bond, striking the correct balance of menace, thrills and humour, using a chase-movie template to ensure attention never wavers.", "Brosnan cements his reputation as the best James Bond since Sean Connery, and sometimes he even gives the master a run for his money.", "Good news is, Tomorrow Never Dies is highly entertaining. It will thrill novices and delight old-guard Bondphiles.", "In Tomorrow Never Dies, the news is mostly good. And when it comes to movies, there's no news like good news.", "In the latest James Bond, our hero saves the world from brand-name unawareness. Tomorrow Never Dies is a dramatized trade show; imagine Comdex or the Geneva Automobile Salon with a plot.", "Yeoh proves so much Bond's equal that they wind up sharing steering privileges on a death-defying motorcycle, her hand on the clutch and his on the brake, their other arms twined around each other. It's a pairing made in sequel heaven.", "The good news in Tomorrow Never Dies is that Pierce Brosnan fills out James Bond's tux considerably better. In his second go at Bond, he seems tougher and less-lightweight.", "While it seems a good idea to have fresh directors on each new film, veteran Roger Spottiswoode doesn't seem to bring much to the party.", "Does this work? Is it worth the trouble? Not really."], "rating": ["6/10", "2.5/5", "3/5", "1/5", "", "", "3/5", "5/10", "C", "4/5", "2.5/4", "4/5", "3/4", "", "4/5", "", "3/4", "2.5/4", "", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "David Hogan", "PJ Nabarro", "Irish Times Staff", "Matthew Sweet", "Ryan Gilbey", "Jeffrey Lyles", "Gary Thompson", "Adrian Turner", "Steven Rea", "Rob Daniel", "Chris Kaltenbach", "Roger Hurlburt", "Jay Boyar", "Joe Morgenstern", "Jami Bernard", "Matt Soergel", "Andy Klein", "Michael Wilmington"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Confessions From A Geek Mind", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">hoganreviews.co.uk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Irish Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent on Sunday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lyles&#39; Movie Files", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sky Cinema", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Florida Times-Union", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune"], "date": ["September 25, 2020", "July 16, 2020", "January 29, 2020", "October 31, 2019", "March 28, 2019", "March 28, 2019", "March 28, 2019", "November 5, 2015", "November 1, 2015", "November 1, 2015", "November 1, 2015", "November 1, 2015", "November 1, 2015", "November 1, 2015", "November 1, 2015", "November 1, 2015", "November 1, 2015", "November 1, 2015", "November 1, 2015", "November 1, 2015"]}}
