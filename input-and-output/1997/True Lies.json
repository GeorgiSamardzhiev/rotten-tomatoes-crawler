{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Secretly a spy but thought by his family to be a dull salesman, Harry Tasker (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is tracking down nuclear missiles in the possession of Islamic jihadist Aziz (Art Malik). Harry's mission is complicated when he realizes his neglected wife, Helen (Jamie Lee Curtis), is contemplating an affair with Simon (Bill Paxton), a used-car salesman who claims he's a spy. When Aziz kidnaps Harry and Helen, the secret agent must save the world and patch up his marriage at the same time.", "rating": "71", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Mystery & Suspense/Romance", "runtime": "2h 21m", "director": "James Cameron", "studio": "LightstormEntertainment,20thCenturyFox", "theater_date": "Jul 15, 1994", "dvd_date": "Oct 7, 2016", "box_office": "$146.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A lot of the amusement springs from the fact that the bad guys get it real good, as only the likes of the musclebound Schwarzenegger can render.", "True Lies is a good but not great movie. It has phenomenal set pieces and a good cast, but it's tough to totally argue for a movie with such bad things attached to it", "Schwarzenegger's comic confidence and good-guy tenacity are a perfect balance, while Curtis wins our sympathy as his repressed wife, showing some deadpan drollery of her own.", "TRUE LIES should get a remake and benefit from all of the special effects breakthroughs that James Cameron has championed in the last twenty-five years and get rid of the basic racism and sexism that otherwise besmirch a fun, action-packed movie.", "After Harry handily humiliates Simon at every turn, True Lies charges back into its anti-Arab jihad.", "Writer/director James Cameron has made his fair share of groundbreaking, great movies, but pound for pound True Lies is his most flat-out entertaining.", "Proves that throwing everything at the camera sometimes works a treat.", "Far be it from me to say that True Lies isn't a fun lark of an action-comedy, but it could stand to be a lot more fun and a lot more larking.", "James Cameron is able to present his usual high-impact action, pushing the film out of the realm of simple Bond spoofing.", "An affectionate homage to James Bond movies, ratcheted up to meet the action/adventure expectations of today's audiences.", "If the Gulf War gave you an insatiable taste for burning oil and burning Arabs, this extravaganza will tide you over for at least a couple of days.", "Providing its share of fun in stretches, pic ultimately overstays its welcome with a level of mayhem that will simply feel like too much for any marginal fan of the genre.", "See website for more details.", "I've said it before, and I'll go on saying it unless he flips out and does an Edith Wharton adaptation: Nobody does action like James Cameron.", "Though not as irksome and irritating as Schwarzenegger's Last Action Hero, this James Cameron actioner is more of a big technical machine than a story which is senseless.", "Half the time, this hi-tech action movie delivers, in a mindless kind of way: it's fast, crude and has enough explosions and cartoon-style violence to satisfy our baser instincts.", "One of the best mega-budgeted summer blockbusters of the modern era. A deft blend of thrilling action and edgy comedy.", "The comedic bits fall flat - but the action sequences are quite outlandish.", "Awnode's best balanced film...fun spy games.", "Could stand to have about 30 minutes excised -- but the final one-liner is classic."], "rating": ["1", "", "", "5/10", "", "A", "4/5", "6/10", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "7.5/10", "4/5", "C+", "", "8/10", "3/5", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Drew Dietsch", "Duane Byrge", "Alex Maidy", "Malcolm Johnson", "Bill Clark", "Caroline Westbrook", "Tim Brayton", "", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Brian Lowry", "Rory L.
