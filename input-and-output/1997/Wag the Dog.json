In need of outside help to quell the situation, presidential adviser Winifred Ames (Anne Heche) enlists the expertise of spin doctor Conrad Brean (Robert De Niro), who decides a distraction is the best course of action. Brean approaches Hollywood producer Stanley Motss (Dustin Hoffman) to help him fabricate a war in Albania -- and once underway, the duo has the media entirely focused on the war.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Barry Levinson", "studio": "PunchProductions,NewLineCinema,BaltimorePictures,TribecaProductions", "theater_date": "Dec 25, 1997", "dvd_date": "Jul 1, 2008", "box_office": "$43.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Perhaps what's so surprising about 1997's Wag the Dog is how the political satire feels so realistic over twenty years following its theatrical release.", "...a fairly static drama that contains few elements worth connecting to or wholeheartedly embracing...", "If anything, in the years since its release, the worlds of politics, entertainment, and news media have grown even more intertwined in which narratives are carefully controlled and expectations are minimal.", "'Wag the Dog,' a movie that's fun to see more than once, comes across as a bitingly funny satire of politics, the media and show business.", "Entertaining, creepily resonant political comedy.", "Smart political satire from director Barry Levinson.", "Anyone who would be inherently interested in this kind of sendup is unlikely to be surprised by anything in this film -- overall it feels like a trifle, if an entertaining one.", "Hilary Henkin and David Mamet's script is gleefully hyperbolic without ever straying from its political target.", "Twisty and flat-out hilarious.", "Feels tossed-off and casual in the best way.", "Strong performances abound in the film.", "", "I doubt it will age as well as Network, but it is close to that realm of brilliance.", "Lazily assembled by director Levinson, it slides into a series of soft, extended skits on engineering a media war, not helped by several badly handled leaps in the story.", "Beyond a couple of hilarious zingers, its impact feels smug and minor.", "Brilliantly scripted and acted to the point where even Barry Levinson's typically uninspired direction doesn't matter.", "Levinson has created a surprising quickie that satirically strikes out at our political system, the media (easy target) and the whole business of image versus reality.", "It is fun when people with Hollywood clout decide to do something as fast and loose as this...", "It's half a brilliant political satire, half a wacky outrageous comedy of errors.
