Watching Who Framed Roger Rabbit is like spending a weekend locked in a room with the looniest Looney Tunes characters.", "It took many, many years before I fully processed just how impressive a technical feat Who Framed Roger Rabbit actually is.", "For audiences who grew up with cartoons as a natural part of their moviegoing, the shock may not be the mix of live and animated folk--it may come from the truly revolutionary sight of great icons of rival studios cheerfully rubbing shoulders.", "An ingenious blend of hand-drawn animation and live action, spliced with humour that's by turns madcap, surreal and violent, Roger Rabbit demonstrates that it's possible to push the technical boundaries while still cooking up decent characters and plots.", "This whizz-bang breakthrough in mixing live action with cartoon characters won a special achievement Oscar for animator Richard Williams.", "Motion pictures may never be the same again, now that the fascinating and utterly miraculous Who Framed Roger Rabbit has come to the screen.", "Imagine watching cartoon characters and relating to them as if they were flesh-and-blood instead of paint-and-ink.
