{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1970s New York City, Studio 54 is the epicenter of sex, drugs and disco music. It's there that up-and-comer Shane O'Shea (Ryan Phillippe) endeavors to make his big-city dreams come true. After catching the eye of the nightclub's owner, Steve Rubell (Mike Myers), Shane quickly rises from busboy to bartender. While coat-check girl Anita (Salma Hayek) tries to get her big break as a singer, Shane finds himself smitten with soap-opera starlet Julie Black (Neve Campbell).", "rating": "17", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Mark Christopher", "studio": "MiramaxFilms,RedeemableFeatures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 21, 2016", "box_office": "$16.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The studio that released the film Miramax, ordered 40 minutes removed from the film and 30 minutes worth of reshoots. The result not only sanitized the film, but fundamentally changed the characters.", "The director's cut of 54 is a remarkable artefact that tells us as much about the 1990s as it does the 1970s.", "A soapy, fictionalized chronicle of the fast times at 54.", "The most affecting moments are shards of sexual behavior... that existed only on the samizdat VHS, the degraded quality suggesting ghostly remnants of film's scissoring [and] the long-dead behaviors on-screen, debauchery and gaucherie alike.", "[The Director's Cut] is out and proud, not at all shying away from the sexual aggression of Phillippe's character as he calmly removes his clothes for any gender.", "The director's cut still has a pacing that lags during the second act, and now that the film's about the love triangle, the scenes with Julie don't really add anything to the overall story. That being said, it deserves a second chance in its new life.", "...comes off like a high-budget cautionary tale, concerned that if it shows anything attractive about Studio 54, some young and innocent viewer might be corrupted...", "A more critical and resonant Hollywood movie about the glorious disco culture screams to be made.", "A shapeless homage to the glory that was Studio 54 in its decadent heyday...", "Neither a great night out nor a great night in.", "Let me pause for a minute to think of a more boring subject for a movie ... Sorry. I give up.", "Myers shining moment. Too bad nobody saw it.", "Myers exploits every vicious, self-hating line that comes his way.", "Just as disappointing as Whit Stillman's Last Days of Disco, Marc Christopher's 54 suffers from a formulaic script that feels like a reworking of Saturday Night Fever and Boogie Nights, both superior and more entertaining pictures.", "The writer seems helpless in finding a way to wrap up the story beyond the arrest of Rubell.", "A mish-mash of bad writing, poor acting (except Myers), amateur directing and mediocre production credits.", "", "... a wasted opportunity", "The 1970s were great times, but most viewers could hardly come to that conclusion based on this film.", "One can only hope \"54\" will hammer the final nail in disco's coffin.
