{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Predicated on a May-December romance. The difference here is that the woman, attractive widow Cary Scott (Jane Wyman), is considerably older than the man, handsome gardener-landscaper Ron Kirby (Rock Hudson). Throwing conventional behavior to the winds and facing social ostracism, Cary pursues her romance with Ron, who is unjustly perceived as a fortune-hunter by Cary's friends and family -- especially her priggish brother Ned (William Reynolds).", "rating": "90", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 29m", "director": "Douglas Sirk", "studio": "UniversalInternationalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 6, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The glorious gift of All That Heaven Allows is Sirk in top form, one of his shining examples of life's wicked parodies.", "Strongly slanted to ring the bell with soap-opera fans, but otherwise of limited appeal.", "As the camera gradually moves in on Cary's despairing face in reflection, we know the mantra of \"life's parade at your fingertips\" is really a mandate for her own imprisonment", "Works as a straightforward melodrama, but is so meticulously crafted by a visual master that it provides endless material for those who wish to mine for deeper social commentary.", "Proof that there is artistry and glory in a genre that never had to apologise for itself, not when it was this confident, beautiful, and good.", "Sirk benefited immeasurably from the fact that the chief subject of his crazy cinema was postwar America.", "A classic and beautiful film for those who love romantic stories", "Romance novel in narrative this transcends its genre with visual depth and perceptive socio-cultural insights.", "One of Sirk's finest films.", "Hudson is handsome and somewhat wooden. Laconic of speech, and imbued with an angel's patience and understanding, it's at times hard to understand his passion for the widow, what with pretty girls just spoilingfor his attention.", "'Time, if anything, will vindicate Douglas Sirk,' wrote Andrew Sarris in 1968. He was right.", "Solid and sensible drama plainly had to give way to outright emotional bulldozing and a paving of easy clichs.", "Beneath the stunningly lovely visuals -- all expressionist colours, reflections, and frames-within-frames, used to produce a precise symbolism -- lies a kernel of terrifying despair", "When Carey (Jane Wyman) first visits the Andersons, friends of Ron (Rock Hudson), Thoreau's Walden is placed on the table.
