{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Two explorers are racing Lewis and Clark to the Pacific Ocean in 1804. Edwards (Matthew Perry) is a glory-seeking fop who's out of his league, Hunt (Chris Farley) is a slovenly, clumsy tracker with a soft spot for toilet humor. Along with a team of misfits and losers, the duo wreaks havoc on the American frontier.", "rating": "8", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Christopher Guest", "studio": "TurnerPictures,DiNoviPictures", "theater_date": "May 29, 1998", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2008", "box_office": "$6.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Unfortunately, Farley's unintended farewell is hardly memorable.", "All of the guys on the expedition are dumb, and they say and do dumb things in dumb ways, dumbly.", "This 1998 comedy set in the early American west isn't unwatchable, just bad.", "All we're left with is a lame script and dithering direction, a lethal combination.", "Those hallmark Farley situations, when he bursts into apoplexy over some challenge or outrage, seem unconvincing here. As for Perry, he doesn't show nearly enough charm or ego to be of interest.", "The plot isn't merely stupid, but heartless; viewers aren't given a single reason to watch beyond the anticipation of seeing Farley fall off more scenery.", "There's a difference between a stupid movie and a movie populated by stupid characters, and director Christopher Guest shows that distinction with Almost Heroes.", "The gags rely heavily on boogers, bird poo and sheep dung, and Farley falls down with monotonous regularity.", "All in the movie have been encouraged to play up the cartoonish aspects of their characters, and they deliver punch lines like a series of elbows to the rib cage.", "You just wish it were half as funny as it tries to be.", "Farley is as energetically crude as ever, but both Perry and director Christopher Guest, who was behind the classic This Is Spinal Tap, seem uncomfortable with the material.", "Despite his compulsion to trash everything in his midst, including himself, Chris Farley deserved better.", "[A] sorry excuse for a comedy.", "Pacing is too slack for pic to ever achieve a satisfying comic momentum, and the limp ending is a real letdown.", "", "A forgettable farce with no flavor...utterly flaccid and foolish.
