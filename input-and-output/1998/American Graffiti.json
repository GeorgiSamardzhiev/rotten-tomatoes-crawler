{"metadata": {"synopsis": "On the last day of summer vacation in 1962, friends Curt (Richard Dreyfuss), Steve (Ronny Howard), Terry (Charles Martin Smith) and John (Paul Le Mat) cruise the streets of small-town California while a mysterious disc jockey (Wolfman Jack) spins classic rock'n'roll tunes. It's the last night before their grown-up lives begin, and Steve's high-school sweetheart, a hot-to-trot blonde, a bratty adolescent and a disappearing angel in a Thunderbird provide all the excitement they can handle.", "rating": "96", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 50m", "director": "George Lucas", "studio": "UniversalPictures,CoppolaCompany,LucasfilmLtd.", "theater_date": "Aug 11, 1973", "dvd_date": "Aug 13, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["I was, and remain, very tempted to add this film to my Top 100.", "A fun-filled cultural snapshot imbued with classic rock and reminiscence.", "George Lucas has directed with a remarkably firm but unostentatious hand, two virtues equally rare in a young film maker.", "Without unnecessary nudging or underlining, Lucas beautifully establishes his characters as both enslaved to the image of themselves which the media have given them and permanently in need of its company.", "Stop reading this and go out and see it!", "... the music-filled picture still holds up nearly a half-century later.", "...it transports you to 1962, to a moment in American history in which all you had to worry about was your car, your music and your friends... [Full review in Spanish]", "The movie is a comic poem which celebrates the past but also catalogues its textures with telling precision. American Graffiti looks like no other movie, an achievement which is always the best measure of a truly gifted director.", "Maybe the best film about teenagers ever made.", "This superb and singular film catches not only the charm and tribal energy of the teen-age 1950s but also the listlessness and the resignation that underscored it all like an incessant bass line in one of the rock-'n'-roll songs of the period.", "[A] hugely influential docu-drama.", "Wonderfully evoking the feel and spirit of the era, this is one of those rare movies you live through rather than watch.", "Nearly 40 years later it still plays as a loose and vibrant testament to an era that is so distinctly America.", "Anyone who has spent their teenage years cruising up and down Main Street will connect with the film... which is part of the reason I didn't.", "Playfully suggests what life was like for white teenagers in small-town America during the 1950s and early 1960s.", "Brilliant and highly influential.", "American Graffiti is a music-infused tone poem - a fond, delicate trip back to an era often forgotten.", "It's one of the all-time great feel good films, but its sly cultural commentary is what makes it the masterpiece that it is.", "Coming-of-age classic still a must-see for teens.", "A funny-serious movie with gorgeous cars and colours and an amazing feel for the artefacts of an instantly vanished era."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "9/10", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "9/10", "", "5/5", "5/5", "", "2/5", "B+", "A+", "9/10", "5/5", "5/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Mike Massie", "John Simon", "Jan Dawson", "Bernard Drew", "Danielle Solzman", "Sebastian Zavala Kahn", "Alan R.
