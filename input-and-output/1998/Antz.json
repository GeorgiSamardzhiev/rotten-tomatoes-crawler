Apparently we were willing to overlook such issues 22 years ago.", "In a world of cookie-cutter movies at least it tries a bunch of weird stuff.", "Amid all the ingenuity and smartness, the work fails to move and contains little wonderment - ironically appropriating the zealous industry of its on-screen ants.", "It's the noble attempt by the doomed PDI to announce its worthiness to the world", "Great effects, but surprisingly violent. Lacks kid appeal.", "A Engaging and awe-inspiring animation once again elevates Shrek's world to fantastic heights, and the laughs are just as freewheeling as we have come to expect.", "Kids may be puzzled by rebellious worker ants chanting Marxist slogans, but their parental guides may welcome the relief from the prevailing blandness of family films.", "By any standard, the film is a remarkable technical achievement.", "The artwork is spectacular, vocal performances uniformly capable and the jokes appealing to both adults and children.", "Appeals to your daydreams when you were a kid and you wondered about the daily physical hassles of an ant.", "", "Visually striking and dynamically shot, this has strong characters and no shortage of incident.", "Though the story is standard formula kids' fare, the Allen presence brings an adult swing to it, making it more than passable for both.", "Succeeds at pushing the technology as well as and offering intelligent family fare that won't leave adults bored. Great fun.", "A clever, funny, fascinating to watch film that could have been more.", "", "...the message of Antz is this: Freedom of choice is important, but one should use their freedom to be decent, responsible, humble, and helpful.", "A few chuckles here and there, and a semi-interesting story line, but nothing too outstanding.", "Has enough of a story to keep a child engaged and a script clever enough to keep an adult amused.", "exciting, often hilarious and frequently wondrous film...
