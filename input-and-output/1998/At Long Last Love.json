There's no chemistry, and very few Cole Porter songs are performed in such a way that you'd guess would make the old lyricist happy. 'You're the Top'? Not with this group doing the singing.", "This foolish attempt at re-creating the lush musicals of the 1930s offers fabulous art deco sets, memorable Cole Porter songs, and slick production values, yet it goes down like a stricken elephant.", "This Cole Porter coloring book, mounted with great expense and no taste, is one of those grand catastrophes that make audiences either hoot in derisive surprise or look away in embarrassment.", "But as they say, when all you have to recommend in your musical is a hairy chest, you're in trouble.", "A disappointing and embarrassing waste of talent.", "It's an indulgent movie -- Peter and Cybill having a lark with their friends -- but it's also a neat parody of '30s musicals.", "At Long Last Love never quite sinks, but then it never leaves the pier.", "A daring experiment that failed.", "Cole Porter fans, steer clear. Actually, everybody steer clear.", "The movie's no masterpiece, but I can't account for the viciousness of some of the critical attacks against it.", "Burt Reynolds and Cybill Shepherd sing and dance...badly!
