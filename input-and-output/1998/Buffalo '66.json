{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Convict Billy Brown (Vincent Gallo) dreads going home so much upon his release from prison that he tries to get back inside. In desperation, Billy kidnaps Layla (Christina Ricci) from a tap dancing class and pleads with her to impersonate his wife and to accompany him home to visit his parents, Janet (Anjelica Huston) and Jimmy (Ben Gazzara). To Billy's dismay, Layla takes to her role enthusiastically. She breaks through to obsessive Buffalo Bills football fan Janet and the hard-edged Jimmy.", "rating": "76", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 52m", "director": "Vincent Gallo", "studio": "MuseProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 6, 2016", "box_office": "$2.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There is a air of intriguing atavism about the textures and contours of Buffalo '66's visual style and tone.", "Gallo, who also wrote, directed and scored Buffalo '66 , is a smart young filmmaker, not least in his casting.", "Performances are outstanding, particularly those of Gallo and Ricci. It`s so refreshing and invigorating to see a film like this.", "For a study in untrammeled lunacy, the movie is a highly constructed and tightly controlled work.", "Gallo's combination of crudeness and sophistication has a preternatural power.", "The intimate, idiosyncratic and very funny Buffalo '66 --directed by and starring Vincent Gallo, from a semi-autobiographical script co-authored with Alison Bagnall --feels like a projection of Gallo's very psyche.", "Gallo's poor, poor pitiful me routine wears very thin, very fast, but Ricci is incandescent, a softly-glowing dumpling of a dream-girl in powder-blue fishnet tights and sparkly tap shoes.", "Vincent Gallo, gaunt and pop-eyed, with a gaze of sexy, hostile paranoia, has the look of a born sociopath or a born movie star (or both).", "If Martin Scorsese, John Cassavetes, and Abel Ferrara took turns directing scenes of a film written by and starring Jerry Lewis, it might resemble Buffalo '66.", "Actor Vincent Gallo makes a feature directing debut with this bizarre, self-indulgent tale of a troubled guy, played by him in a narcissistic mode, who has never reconciled his unhappy childhood.", "It may not be the masterpiece that its narcissistic writer-director-star Vincent Gallo has claimed to be, but his filmmaking debut is a ceaselessly fascinating piece of work.", "Pic receives an incalculable boost from Ricci.", "Gallo's directorial debut is one of a kind, an eccentric, provocative comedy which laces a poignant love story with both a sombre, washed-out naturalism and surreal musical vignettes.", "Gallo transforma um personagem antiptico e instvel em uma figura comovente, enquanto Ricci, em uma de suas atuaes mais sensuais, quase rouba o filme.", "", "", "Funny and quirky, with a great performance by Ricci.
