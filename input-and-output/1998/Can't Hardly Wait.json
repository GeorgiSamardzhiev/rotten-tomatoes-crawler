{"metadata": {"synopsis": "School's out, and an entire graduating class -- from football stars and cool girls to complete nerds -- gathers at a wealthy classmate's home for a party. There, the artistic Preston (Ethan Embry) hopes to move in on Amanda (Jennifer Love Hewitt), the beauty he has admired from afar for years. Dorky William (Charlie Korsmo) schemes to pay back meathead Mike (Peter Facinelli) for years of bullying, and would-be rapper Kenny (Seth Green) gets locked in a room with snarky Denise (Lauren Ambrose).", "rating": "40", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Deborah Kaplan, Harry Elfont", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation,TallTreesProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$25.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["I really didn't care.

[Full review in Spanish].", "Kaplan and Elfont provide a real public service by showing how underage binge drinking can boost bookish students' social lives.", "Fortunately, some of the appealing young performers -- who include Ethan Embry, Charlie Korsmo, Lauren Ambrose and, especially, Seth Green -- manage to emerge from the film's generic suburban-teen backdrop.", "There are signs that Can't Hardly Wait once had more serious aspirations... But in the final edit, at least, it's the dumb, broad slapstick that prevails, short-circuiting identification with the characters before it can begin.", "The majority of the film is mired in magazine cliches and tired gags. Oh, look, the foreign exchange student only knows how to say he's a sex machine, haw! And the nerd's getting drunk! Hoo!", "This formula teen flick has engaging performances and a few laughs.", "What's best about Wait are the bright turns by its young cast.", "The film deserves credit, both for its breezy pacing and its uncommon tendency to make its characters smarter and geekier than they might have been.", "Flat characters are stuck in underdeveloped situations in this attempt by first-time directors Deborah Kaplan and Harry Elfont to recapture the mood of a John Hughes 1980s teen comedy.", "This charmless and predictable teen comedy is packed with tired, second-hand ideas that render it wholly uninspiring.", "It's mostly broad comedy. Not that there's anything wrong with that, just that it's all been done before.", "Youth may be wasted on the young, but it's a drop in the bucket compared to the time wasted pandering to them.", "Can't Hardly Wait offers nothing that its predecessors hasn't, but has possibly broken new ground in terms of underage drinking and teen sex.", "It's all cutely derivative, occasionally charming and very occasionally clever.", "A high-spirited, synthetically raucous house-party comedy.", "It's not supposed to be a revelation--just a pleasant rendition of a teen-comedy trope.", "John Hughes must be spinning in his grave.", "A decidedly healthy antidote to the hate-driven, ghoulishly cynical bloodlettings of Scream, I Know What You Did Last Summer and the rest of that sick ilk."], "rating": ["1/5", "2/5", "3/4", "2/4", "2.5/4", "2/4", "1/4", "", "", "", "1/5", "", "", "1.5/4", "", "3/4", "B-", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Justin Brown", "Brandon Collins", "Federico Furzan", "Mark Caro", "Carrie Rickey", "Dave Kehr", "Melanie McFarland", "M.
