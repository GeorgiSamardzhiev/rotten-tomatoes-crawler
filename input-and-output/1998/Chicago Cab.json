{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A nameless Chicago cab driver (Paul Dillon) picks up more than 30 different passengers over the course of a typical December day. Many of his fares are rude, from the evangelical Christians who force their small daughter to try to convert him, to the couple who pretend to have sex in the back seat. The driver tries to maintain his calm even as the passengers drive him crazy. As the day progresses, he tries to intervene, wondering how to help some of the mistreated women he picks up.", "rating": "56", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Mary Cybulski, John Tintori", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 26, 2020", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An all-star cast of cameos is a balm for forced cheer.", "The various passengers (played by John Cusack, Julianne Moore and Laurie Metcalf) highlight the funny, scary, and dreary moments that define a typical work day of a Chicago cab driver.", "Running on a flat-tyre throughout.....a trip to the dentist would be more exciting", "", "...pretty much pointless.", "True, the movie seems to be mixing the paint a bit thick -- but would the film improve with the substitution of boring passengers who just want to go to the Wrigley Building, and leave a nice tip?
