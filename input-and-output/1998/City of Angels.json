{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This is the story of Seth (Nicolas Cage), an angel who wanders the Los Angeles area invisible to humans. As the demise of an individual approaches, he spends time near them and becomes visible while acting as their traveling companion during their trip to the great hereafter. His discovery of distraught heart surgeon Maggie (Meg Ryan) inspires him to forego his immortality and exist on earth with her as a feeling and mortal entity.", "rating": "58", "genre": "Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 57m", "director": "Brad Silberling", "studio": "MonarchyEnterprisesB.V.,WarnerBrothers,RegencyEnterprises,AtlasEntertainment", "theater_date": "Apr 10, 1998", "dvd_date": "May 1, 2008", "box_office": "$78.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "Glossy romance as an angel falls for a surgeon.", "", "The movie's eerie, slightly menacing vision of black-clad angels lurking in the shadowy corners of unsuspecting lives is genuinely haunting.", "A good deal better than it has any right to be.", "Strains to achieve the enchantingly sublime, but ends up sinking to the depressingly ridiculous.", "As a remake it's not as poetic as Wenders' masterpiece Wings of Desire, but it's supremely mounted (by ace lenser John Seale) and contains touching performances from Nicolas Cage and Meg Ryan deviating from their respective screen images.", "Funnier than Wenders' version, and it also succeeds in visualising LA as a magical city while dealing intelligently with the themes of mortality, sacrifice, free will, and the mixed blessings of the human condition.", "An emotionally uninvolving flick that attempts to play on the heart strings of the viewer and fails in its effort.", "City of Angels is the sort of compromised movie that could have been almost good, but decided to be a great big hit instead.", "City of Angels raises theological questions, albeit in a somewhat pedestrian manner, and makes them an integral part of its otherwise formulaic plot.", "Superb imagery can't compensate for deficiencies of Dana Steven's script and can't hide the formulaic nature of this film.", "This useless remake lacks the sheer ethereal beauty of the original Wings of Desire.", "Why would anyone remake Wim Wenders' masterpiece, Wings of Desire?
