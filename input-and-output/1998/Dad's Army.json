{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Near the end of World War II, the Walmington-on-Sea Home Guard platoon deals with a female journalist and a German spy.", "rating": "31", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Oliver Parker", "studio": "DJFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 6, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Another mediocre modern remake of a beloved old TV show.", "Borrowing enough from the original series and allowing the new faces to develop the old characters, they've found the balance so often lacking in reboots.", "The comedy is a little too obvious, the plot is razor-thin and the story never takes advantage of its film-length running time, and often it feels like a normal episode stretched to breaking point.", "It's not the Dad's Army we know -- it never could be -- but it's an affectionate and well-crafted homage that builds to a climax that is as funny as it is strangely stirring.", "\"Dad's Army,\" while perfectly pleasant, isn't very funny, fighting to find something grand to do with its WWII setting and cast of quirky characters. Parker isn't asleep here, but he isn't inventive either.", "British WWII comedy with slapstick action won't engage kids.", "A noble effort that ends up more Dunkirk than D-Day.", "Those old enough to remember one of the high points of British comedy will surely not like this one up 'em; those who don't would be best to look away.", "I took my elderly mum to the film, and she enjoyed it well enough, but noted, \"there's not much of a story, is there?\"", "The plot creaks as much as Jones's delivery van but it gets everyone from A to B intact. A modest accomplishment, to be true, but somehow a fitting salute to a show celebrating the British art of muddling through.", "Dad's Army has a lot of heart, and is certainly an amiable piece, but being uncynical is not enough to justify a trip to the cinema, as a film that offers little by way of jokes, or substantial narrative purpose.", "Who do you think you are kidding, fake Dad's Army?", "There really is no reason for the film to exist.", "Sticking doggedly to the tried-and-tested formula of the television comedy, this big-screen return is virtually a carbon copy of the original with the starry cast delivering spot-on imitations of their beloved predecessors.", "It was a sitcom, which is to say habitual - and since it is still frequently broadcast and enjoyed, it is with us as much as it ever was. And we don't enjoy our favourite habits being changed for us.", "Oliver Parker's direction does little to lighten the tone; from the bull-in-a-field opening to the beach-bound battle finale, subtlety is not the film's strong suit.", "The plot is thin and the gags are patchy but the expert timing of some of Britain's finest comedy actors has got our Home Guard heroes marching again.", "The beloved 1970s British sit-com gets the big screen treatment, although there's been very little attempt to do anything clever with it aside from A-list casting.", "While it ticks some nostalgia boxes, Dad's Army simply feels like a missed opportunity.", "Quaint in era of quick-fire, on-message political humour, McColl recognises the strengths and virtues of the original series to deliver a cinematic experience akin to a buttered scone and a nice cup of tea."], "rating": ["2/5", "3/5", "", "4/5", "C", "2/5", "2/5", "2/5", "2/5", "3/5", "2/5", "2/5", "3/5", "3/5", "1/5", "2/5", "3/5", "2/5", "2/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Leigh Paatsch", "Bertie Archer", "Paula Fleri-Soler", "Matthew Bond", "Brian Orndorf", "Renee Schonfeld", "Alan Corr", "Peter Calder", "Paul Casserly", "Jason Best", "Stefan Pape", "Tara Brady", "Henry Fitzherbert", "Allan Hunter", "David Sexton", "Mark Kermode", "Andy Lea", "Rich Cline", "Alex Zane", "Tim Evans"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times of Malta", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Mail on Sunday (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Blu-ray.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">RT\u00c9 (Ireland)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Zealand Herald", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flicks.co.nz", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Talk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">HeyUGuys", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Irish Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Express (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Express (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Observer (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Star (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Contactmusic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Sun (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sky Cinema"], "date": ["May 13, 2020", "April 9, 2019", "February 16, 2019", "October 25, 2017", "January 26, 2017", "January 10, 2017", "July 26, 2016", "April 28, 2016", "March 2, 2016", "February 10, 2016", "February 8, 2016", "February 8, 2016", "February 7, 2016", "February 7, 2016", "February 7, 2016", "February 7, 2016", "February 6, 2016", "February 5, 2016", "February 4, 2016", "February 4, 2016"]}}
