{"metadata": {"synopsis": "College freshmen Josh (Tom Everett Scott) and Cooper (Mark-Paul Gosselaar) are more interested in hitting the bottle than in hitting the books -- and their poor grades are set to get them kicked out of school. Their only hope of passing is to find a roommate who will kill himself. That's because an oddball college code states that a suicide victim's roommates automatically get straight A's. But sharing space with a lineup of lunatics proves enough to drive both boys crazy.", "rating": "15", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Alan Cohn", "studio": "MTVFilms,PacificWestern", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$15.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The jokes are few.

No amount of reworking with a No. 2 pencil will do any good.", "It's amiably played, but Alan Cohn's direction lacks bite.", "Dead Man on Campus is a modestly amusing trifle that merits a passing grade as lightweight entertainment.", "As a satire of new-style collegiate types, this MTV production actually evinces a few germs of rancid wit.
