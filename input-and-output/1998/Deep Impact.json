Grizzled astronaut Spurgeon \"Fish\" Tanner (Robert Duvall) and his team will land on the comet and lay explosives, hopefully deterring the object from its doomsday course.

It was terrible some years ago (as Asteroid), and it's still lost in space as Deep Impact.", "A huge comet is on a collision course with Earth in director Mimi Leder's science-fiction disaster movie, which gains a certain amount of credibility by highlighting the human side of the impending catastrophe.", "Deep Impact isn't especially deep, and the extent of its impact seems limited. But it does turn out to be a fairly involving movie.", "Why isn't it scarier? Maybe its targets are too scattered, its final impact too shallow. Maybe director Mimi Leder couldn't locate the right overall tone. And maybe the two writers simply don't take the story very seriously.", "Neither deep nor impactive, but goes well with popcorn.", "When all is said and done, it is precisely such lackluster imitations of real life that prevent this lightweight melodrama from leaving any deep, or lasting, impact of its own.", "These folks are so blase, you'd think that scientists had predicted pennies from Heaven instead of world's end within the year.", "An effective and entertaining catastrophic drama that sets itself apart by giving its attention to personal stakes. [Full Review in Spanish]", "A three-hankie weeper in disaster-movie drag, and its tear-jerking bull's-eyes are separated by long stretches of tedium.", "If director Mimi Leder is really guilty of anything, it's of wasting three first-rate actors in underdeveloped roles while allowing Leoni's shell-shocked, unconvincing turn to become an embarrassment.", "The film is set up to be a ringing endorsement of the human species under pressure, but what comes across is something far less ennobling.", "Unfortunately Morgan Freeman, the compassionate, helpless U.S. president, and Robert Duvall, an astronaut who finds he hasn't passed his prime, have less time on-screen than Tea Leoni, who's unconvincing as a journalist.", "Director Mimi Leder admirably insisted on making the human relationships count for as much as the cheap thrills in this killer- comet movie.
