{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When the tiny nation of Freedonia goes bankrupt, its wealthy benefactor, Mrs. Teasdale (Margaret Dumont), insists that the wacky Rufus T. Firefly (Groucho Marx) become the country's president. Sensing a weakness in leadership, the bordering nation of Sylvania sends in the spies Pinky (Harpo Marx) and Chicolini (Chico Marx) to set the stage for a revolution. As Firefly clashes with the Sylvanian ambassador (Louis Calhern), plenty of mayhem ensues, and the countries verge on all-out war.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Classics/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 10m", "director": "Leo McCarey", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "Nov 17, 1933", "dvd_date": "Dec 3, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One incidental sequence of slapstick in which Harpo smashes a mirror and then appears opposite Groucho as his reflection, is the funniest thing in any Marx film since The Cocoanuts.", "Babbling absurdity is the main ingredient and chaos is the result, with random jokes, skits, and sketches composing the bulk of the story.", "The Marx Brothers in one of their slighter divertissements.
