{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this bittersweet, classic musical drama, the vibrant and beautiful young Fanny Brice (Barbra Streisand) starts out as a bit player on the New York City vaudeville stage, but works her way up to stardom on Broadway. Valued for her vocal and comedic talents by the renowned theater impresario Florenz Ziegfeld (Walter Pidgeon), Fanny thrives, but her relationship with her suave, imprisoned businessman husband, Nick Arnstein (Omar Sharif), is another story.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "2h 31m", "director": "William Wyler", "studio": "RastarPictures,ColumbiaPictures", "theater_date": "Sep 19, 1968", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$223.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["In Barbra Streisand Funny Girl thumps down an ace.", "It's hard to think of Funny Girl, in fact, apart from Barbra Streisand. She is the life force. Director William Wyler simply drapes the opulent show around her.", "When she is singing--in a marvelous scene on roller skates--when she throws a line away, or shrugs, or looks funny or sad, she has a power, gentleness and intensity that rather knocks all the props and sets and camera angles on their ear.", "William Wyler's adaption of the stage musical is transformative for many millennials. Whether wearing a hijab, sporting a yarmulke, or bareheaded, my students embrace Streisand's Brice and the star/character's professional chutzpah & insecurities.", "In lesser hands this would fall flat because nothing is written to comfort the supporting players. They are extras with names and blurred faces.", "Dazzling musical romance is long but entertaining.", "Legendary diva Streisand won an Oscar for her performance as legendary Ziegfeld girl Fanny Brice... who else but Babs could have portrayed her so well?... Great film it isn't, but it sure is a helluva lot of fun.", "Streisand is stunning, but the film is a trial, particularly when the music disappears somewhere around the 90-minute mark and all that's left is leaden melodrama.", "A fine movie musical and a nice reminder of the time when Streisand was a talent rather than a 'phenomenon'.", "This extended Streisand Special has done absolutely nothing to correct the flaws in the Broadway original.", "Few film debuts in the 1960s were more auspicious than that of Barbra Streisand in Funny Girl.", "Barbra Streisand in her Hollywood debut makes a marked impact.", "I wish William Wyler's direction was more inventive and humurous (it's his first musical), but Streisand gives a meteoric performance, as Fanny Frice and as herself, showing a tremendous charismatic presence that goes beyond physical looks and acting.", "[Streisand gives] a natural, unforced performance, easily one of the three or four best Best Actresses in Oscar history.", "One of the all-time great film musicals with dazzling Streisand.", "You will have made your mind up about Babs one way or the other, but for the rare uninitiated, this is a fine introduction to her talents.", "Well worth watching, even if most later Streisand movies aren't.", "Given how she grew into perhaps the most annoyingly egocentric entertainer in all the world, it's difficult to imagine that Barbra Streisand was once an ingenue.", "", "It is impossible to praise Miss Streisand too highly; hard to find much to praise about the rest of the film."], "rating": ["", "", "", "9/10", "3/4", "4/5", "", "", "3.5/5", "", "4/4", "", "B+", "3.5/5", "5/5", "4/5", "", "2.5/4", "5/5", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Penelope Houston", "Margaret Hinxman", "Renata Adler", "Brandon Judell", "David Keyes", "Renee Schonfeld", "MaryAnn Johanson", "Dave Kehr", "Richard Luck", "", "", "Variety Staff", "Emanuel Levy", "Michael W.
