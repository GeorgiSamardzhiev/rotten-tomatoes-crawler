He enjoys his life of money and luxury, but is oblivious to the horror that he causes. A drug addiction and a few mistakes ultimately unravel his climb to the top.

And he made it accordingly.", "I've never seen a movie with such swagger. When you watch it you feel like you're getting away with something.", "From the soundtrack to the dialogue to the brutal violence, everything is coated in humor - an uncommon but wry style to impart on a movie with such serious themes.", "Henry Hill's love song to his life in a Mafia family.", "It's got a sharp script and good performances all around, which makes it very entertaining.", "\"The movie's morality lies in its form.\"", "Complex, volatile, ironic and disquieting, Scorsese's Goodfellas is a masterly achievement in intense observation.", "It's probably the manic air and the sense that what we're really watching is a black comedy that transmits the most.", "The dialogue is as wonderful as it is profane. The performances are as down-to-earth and familiar as they are superlative achievements in screen acting. The movie is so densely textured, you can almost smell the gravy cooking on the stove in the kitchen.", "Is it a great movie? I don't think so. But it's a triumphant piece of filmmaking-journalism presented with the brio of drama.", "Anti-romantic, it nevertheless sweeps us into the allure of mob glamour -- then slams us with its cost of admission.", "Scorsese's barely fictionalized adaptation of Hill's memoir captures the charge of being a mobster on New York in the sixties and seventies without glorifying the behavior by keying into Hill's willfully self-deluded perspective.", "Robert De Niro is reliably dynamic, and Joe Pesci's portrait of a gangster with a sense of humour is hideously memorable, but there's no doubt that GoodFellas fights a losing battle against numbness.", "The best movie about who gangsters are, and how they came to exert such a magnetic pull on American culture.", "A fascinating, intelligent, and in some ways groundbreaking movie.", "It's a film full of thrilling entertainment: a juicy, wry and relentless account of a garish way of life.", "For its swaggering energy, the heart-in-your-throat pacing and for some of the most memorable, most imitated scenes in mafia movie history, this must rank as one of Scorsese's finest films, if not the best.", "Goodfellas is a terrifying film because, like much of Scorsese's best work, it is about the lives of avuncular psychopaths, and pretty-boy Liotta brilliantly encapsulates that fetid contradiction.", "This is Scorsese at the very height of his powers, orchestrating storytelling with a dynamic urgency and a bravura use of camera, music and outstanding performers.", "Brash and brilliant ..."], "rating": ["5/5", "", "1", "4.0/4", "7.5/10", "4/4", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "4/5", "5/5", "4/5", "5/5", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Rob Gonsalves", "Sean Burns", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Rachel Wagner", "Josh Larsen", "Kirk Honeycutt", "PJ Nabarro", "Rick Chatenever", "Pauline Kael", "Jay Carr", "Sean Axmaker", "Adam Mars-Jones", "Tim Brayton", "Tom Milne", "Edward Porter", "Wendy Ide", "David Jenkins", "Allan Hunter", "Peter Bradshaw"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The ARTery", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Santa Cruz Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Globe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Stream on Demand", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternate Ending", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Monthly Film Bulletin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sunday Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Observer (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Little White Lies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Express (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian"], "date": ["September 18, 2020", "September 15, 2020", "September 14, 2020", "September 9, 2020", "March 12, 2020", "October 11, 2019", "September 19, 2019", "July 17, 2019", "February 26, 2019", "September 6, 2018", "April 27, 2018", "March 2, 2018", "November 13, 2017", "August 30, 2017", "January 27, 2017", "January 23, 2017", "January 22, 2017", "January 20, 2017", "January 19, 2017", "January 19, 2017"]}}
