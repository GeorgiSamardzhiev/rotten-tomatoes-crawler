{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1960s Baltimore, dance-loving teen Tracy Turnblad (Nikki Blonsky) auditions for a spot on \"The Corny Collins Show\" and wins. She becomes an overnight celebrity, a trendsetter in dance, fun and fashion. Perhaps her new status as a teen sensation is enough to topple Corny's reigning dance queen and bring racial integration to the show.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Comedy/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Adam Shankman", "studio": "NewLineCinema", "theater_date": "Jul 20, 2007", "dvd_date": "Feb 1, 2010", "box_office": "$118.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Marc Shaiman and Chris Wittman's score sparkles and the film's production design and appearance remain faithful to Waters' vision of 1960's Baltimore.", "The latest version is just as good, if not better, with an infectious soundtrack and an all-star cast that precisely hits every note. This is easily the most entertaining major studio release of 2007.", "Nikki Blonsky is a complete delight.", "The songs by composer Marc Shaiman and lyricist Scott Whitman are big, bold and deliriously infectious, the kind of music that leaves you wanting to stand up and shout, or at least get up and dance.", "This film leaps at you with such joy and vigour and generosity you cannot reject it.", "If any movie musical could threaten the standing of retro favourite Grease, it's this one.", "Director-choreographer Adam Shankman has come up with one of the purest entertainments of the summer.", "It pays respect to the original while also carving its own image as a truly good musical.", "Much as Hairspray serves as a showcase for the effervescent charms of newcomer Blonsky, its greatest trick is to revitalise the careers of a few old Hollywood faithfuls.", "In alchemy the transmuting of materials between forms distills them to their purest elements. In film, the opposite is true. The more iterations, the more muddled things get. Hairspray is good at what it does but not everything it does is good.", "The script is full of anachronisms, but Hairspray's sense of history delivers a needed spritz in the face.", "Much of the fun comes from director-choreographer Adam Shankman's happy acceptance of musical staples", "Shankman's crassly theatrical attenuation of Hairspray only draws gay culture away from a moment of American history with which it ought to have a great deal in common", "It falls to individual efforts by the cast to keep the eye and ear coming back for more.", "Hairspray is an energetic romp, but as a social statement -- which it pretends to be -- it's cartoonish. And as a playful look back at a time and place, it's simplistic shtik. It's a mountain of whipped cream, with an occasional chocolate sprinkle.", "For a star-studded big-budget musical, Hairspray does a nice job of retaining the funky sweetness of the original.", "I will confess that Travolta totally turned me around. A mountain of a woman in his female fat suit, he commits 150% to the role.", "The most refreshing and enjoyable musical of this century%u2014Hairspray.", "Even if the new Hairspray seems a welcome return to camp for Travolta, his mock seriousness is as frozen as ever.", "The film works best for me when they are making fun of the racial climate of the 1960s."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "", "A", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "6.5/10", "", "", "", "4/5", "2.0/5", "", "7/10", "", "4/10", "7/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Micheal Compton", "Rachel Wagner", "Matthew Lucas", "Deborah Ross", "Alan Jones", "Michael Hastings", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Nick Levine", "Joshua Starnes", "Ken Eisner", "Fernando F.
