{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Jake Shuttleworth (Denzel Washington) has spent the last six years in prison after accidentally killing his wife during a violent domestic dispute, leaving his son, star basketball prospect Jesus Shuttleworth (Ray Allen), to fend for himself. One day, the prison warden (Ned Beatty) approaches Jake with an unusual offer: He'll be given a week of parole to convince Jesus to attend the governor's alma mater, with the promise of a shortened sentence if he succeeds.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 14m", "director": "Spike Lee", "studio": "TouchstonePictures,40Acres&amp;AMuleFilmworks", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 4, 2016", "box_office": "$21.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Spike Lee sports drama has strong language, violence, sex.", "As a director, Lee continues to hone his considerable craft and is unafraid to take creative risks along the way.", "", "A long, boring, meandering, dog of a movie.", "Lee's attack on how big business is not only ruining the game he loves but also playing with people's lives is direct and brave, while his passion, insight and intelligence are evident and admirable.", "Lacking the moral indignation and militant politics of Lee's former work, this vibrantly colorful father-son melodrama is soft at the center, but it's one of the most accessible films Lee has made and Denzel Washington is terrific.", "At the end of Mr. Lee's movie, all you feel is the distraction of Mr. Lee's stylistic exhibitionism, without which, I concede, he might not be regarded as a genius in some quarters.", "[Lee] gets a charming performance from Allen, who, in his acting debut, occupies his pedestal with grace and diffidence.", "Though too long by a good half hour, Lee's latest film packs a genuine emotional punch.", "As usual, Lee tries many kinds of stylistic effects and uses wall-to-wall music (by Aaron Copland and Public Enemy); what's different this time is how personally driven the story feels.", "Most scenes play too long, with a surplus of ideas, textures, tones and characters, and after 134 minutes it's clear Lee's problem with closure hasn't gone away.", "Lee paints intimate characters who are about more than the game. Themes of integrity, honesty, loyalty and familial love are woven through the film resulting in a complex, thought-provoking human drama.", "Shrewdly exposes the underbelly of college recruiting and the pressures exerted on talented high school basketball stars.", "Flawed but powerful.", "It is a wonderful thing to watch two artists work so well together. I am speaking, in this case, of Spike Lee and Denzel Washington.", "The hypocritical misogyny of He Got Game is a fundamental weakness that reviewers so far have been happy to downplay or even to dismiss.", "Lee should have drawn up a tighter game plan but just the same his hoops hoopla still has enough game (mostly in the form of Washington) to win over the audience.", "As brilliant and perplexing as the filmmaker himself.", "Only a director as good as Spike Lee could make a coherent movie out of this messy, jejune set-up ...", "Washington's Jake Shuttlesworth looks tough and hard, an odd but refreshing turn for an actor long associated with handsomely heroic roles."], "rating": ["3/5", "", "B+", "", "", "B", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "B+", "3/4", "6/10", "4/5", "C", "2.5/5", "3/4", "A", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Barbara Shulgasser", "Michael Rechtshaffen", "Owen Gleiberman", "Jon Popick", "", "Emanuel Levy", "Andrew Sarris", "David Edelstein", "Maitland McDonagh", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Derek Adams", "Robin Clifford", "Judith Egerton", "Dragan Antulov", "John R.
