{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Ari (Alex Dimitriades), the son of two Greek immigrants, is an alienated teenager who lives in Melbourne, Australia. He spends his time seeking out cheap thrills, and, over the course of one day, he dives into a bottomless pit of hedonism. He sleeps with a few men he meets, he sleeps with his friend Betty (Elena Mandalis), he takes drugs, he sells drugs and he rages against society. Ari seems numb to life until he and his best friend (Paul Capsis) have a violent run-in with the cops.", "rating": "63", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Ana Kokkinos", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 10, 2017", "box_office": "$378.7K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["... the movie demonstrates just how hard coming out can be, especially for those more at war with themselves than with the culture around them.", "Director Ana Kokkinos has an eye for local color but spends little time developing the supporting characters.", "", "", "", "In a way, the film is a kissing cousin to the 1960s kitchen sink dramas of the British cinema and the working-class angst of German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder.", "", "", "", "Anyone of any generation who has ever felt at odds with his or her environment can identify with the characters in Head On.", "Although Head On has a certain rude power, it's definitely not a date flick.", "A film more easily admired than enjoyed, but there is much to admire in this bold, unsettling film.", "Ari comes off as little more than a self-centered, bigoted layabout, contemptuous of anyone who works for a living and a trial to his family.", "Head On crashes rights into your gay expectations and drags them down into the gutter. Powerful forces are at work here. You won't go home laughing.
