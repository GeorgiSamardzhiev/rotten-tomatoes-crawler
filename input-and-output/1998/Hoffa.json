But the movie is a major disappointment.", "Big and portentous, Hoffa feels like a series of acting exercises inflated to epic proportions. But as a portrait of unionism's most controversial figure, it offers only flickering illumination.", "Danny De Vito's Hoffa is artfully constructed, masterfully played, and travels at speeds beyond the prescriptive norm.", "Hoffa, with its jaundiced script and a director wedded to his rose-tinted spectacles, is a mess, with only the sterling truculence of Nicholson's performance to mitigate it.", "DeVito is blasting away with the audacity of a film student, making Hoffa an effort of extraordinary detail, craftsmanship, and directorial ingenuity.", "", "Nicholson's intense, volcanic performance saves this part-fact, part-fiction biopic that's a little too in awe of its subject.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "An extremely underrated film. Well worth watching, again and again.", "", "A hugely underrated, passionate, powerful biopic.", "", "A decent, but flawed movie. The performance by Nicholson is tremendous, and he really becomes Hoffa, but the rest of the film just isn't on the same level as he is.
