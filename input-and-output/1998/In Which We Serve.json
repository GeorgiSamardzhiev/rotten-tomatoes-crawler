{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Co-directors David Lean and Noel Coward (in his sole filmmaking effort) created this patriotic World War II drama under the auspices of Great Britain's Ministry of Information. After the sinking of the HMS Torrin during the Battle of Crete in 1941, the ship's survivors -- including Captain Kinross (Noel Coward), Chief Petty Officer Hardy (Bernard Miles) and Seaman Blake (John Mills) -- recall their tour of duty in flashback while awaiting rescue in lifeboats being strafed by German airplanes.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "Noel Coward, David Lean", "studio": "BritishLionFilmCorporation,TwoCitiesFilmsLtd.", "theater_date": "Dec 23, 1942", "dvd_date": "Feb 21, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Palpably fraudulent.", "Established Lean as the a director to watch, and foreshadowed his later prowess at focusing on intimate themes against a grand backdrop.", "This is, to my mind, the finest war drama produced yet and because of the strength of its understatement and recognition occasionally of human weakness is propaganda of the very best sort. It should be seen by all.", "... an accomplished, sincere, and moving piece of filmmaking that honors the characters and involves the audience.", "Noel Coward, who also co-directed and wrote the script, brings weight and dignity to the role of Captain Kinross.", "a particularly memorable World War II British propaganda film, having successfully outlived its initial propagandistic value and solidified into a timelessly moving drama of human determination and tenacity", "Though agit-prop and sentimental, this UK WWII drama is superior to Hollywood's patriotic flagwavers, and it's important historically, featuring the directorial debut of David Lean (with Noel Coward), who became a major international figure in the 1950s", "Coward is at his peak in this patriotic, thoughtful WWII British production.", "Noel Coward performed with unexpected brilliance here as co-director, writer, musical composer, and star of this stirring WWII drama.", "No less than half a dozen credits for this film go to Noel Coward. And they're well earned.", "It's dated, but still holds up as one of the better flagwavers.", "Staged with what passed at the time for honest understatement, it now looks impossibly patronising, the epitome of stiff upper lip.", "Coward's tribute to the Royal Navy during World War II is as stirring as it is human. He puts a face on war and those who fight it.", "", "In Which We Serve is not only one of the greatest of all British war movies but also marks the mighty David Lean's first major contribution to cinema.", "One of the most eloquent motion pictures of these or any other times had its American premire at the Capitol Theatre last night.", "Sentimental, to be sure, and a tad too stiff-upper-lipped at times, but it is a moving portrait of a navy destroyer, the men who served on it.", "Perhaps the most honored propaganda film of World War II, in which the survivors of a torpedoed British battleship recall their reasons for fighting through individual flashbacks."], "rating": ["", "4/4", "", "", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "B", "5/5", "3.5/4", "", "B", "", "4/5", "3/5", "5/5", "5/5", "3.5/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Gilbert Seldes", "Matthew Lucas", "MFB Critics", "Sean Axmaker", "Matt Brunson", "James Kendrick", "Emanuel Levy", "Steve Crum", "", "Variety Staff", "Dennis Schwartz", "Tom Milne", "Bob Bloom", "Carol Cling", "Richard Luck", "Bosley Crowther", "Michael W.
