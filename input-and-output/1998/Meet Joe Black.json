However, before he reaches that landmark, he is visited by Death (Brad Pitt), who has taken human form as Joe Black, a young man who recently died. Joe and Bill make a deal: Bill will be given a few extra days of his life, and Joe will spend the same time getting to know what it's like to be human. It seems like a perfect arrangement, until Joe falls in love -- with Bill's daughter.", "rating": "45", "genre": "Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "3h", "director": "Martin Brest", "studio": "UniversalPictures,CityLightsPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 18, 2014", "box_office": "$44.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Not bad, just not as good as it could have been had the editor been allowed to hack an hour or so off the running time.", "A savory, extralong feature whose obvious plotlines unfold with an almost painful slowness that somehow makes them deeper.", "To call the three-hour-long \"Meet Joe Black\" leaden would do an injustice to lead.", "I've never encountered such dramatic flatulence, never heard so many pregnant silences that don't deliver, never watched so many close-ups that graze on actors' faces until every last trace of expression has been devoured.", "Martin Brest's weepie is nicely played but overlong - especially considering the original zipped by in under 80 minutes.", "One tedious, sentimental, drawn out scene gives way to another and death does seem to be having dominion over us.", "Pitt, who is not asked to do much more here than behave alternately like a robot, a bashful boy and a moron, fulfills his modest tasks with aplomb.
