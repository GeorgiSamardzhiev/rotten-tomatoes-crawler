{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Twin thrill-seekers Phil (Paul Walker) and Stew Deedle (Steve Van Wormer) are hip Hawaiian surfers shipped out to Wyoming for summer camp ... before they're expelled from school! But when they get sidetracked to Yellowstone National Park, they fall into jobs as rookie rangers to impress a sexy lieutenant. That kicks off a hilarious wilderness adventure as the Deedles battle prairie dogs, surf roaring rapids, and rescue Old Faithful from a vengeful ex-ranger.", "rating": "7", "genre": "Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Steve Boyum", "studio": "WaltDisneyPictures,PeakProductions,DiCEntertainment", "theater_date": "Mar 27, 1998", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$4.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Teen slacker comedy has some peril, potty humor.", "", "Dumb is one thing, but this sorry attempt at action-comedy from stuntman turned director Steve Boyum is in an intelligence-deprived class all its own.", "If all of this sounds ridiculous, it is.", "Could've spared me the introduction", "", "", "", "", "", "As I have said in the past, I have barely been able to contain my excitement in the recent avalanche of quality Disney fare.
