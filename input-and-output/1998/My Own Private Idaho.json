{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this loose adaptation of Shakespeare's \"Henry IV,\" Mike Waters (River Phoenix) is a gay hustler afflicted with narcolepsy. Scott Favor (Keanu Reeves) is the rebellious son of a mayor. Together, the two travel from Portland, Oregon to Idaho and finally to the coast of Italy in a quest to find Mike's estranged mother. Along the way they turn tricks for money and drugs, eventually attracting the attention of a wealthy benefactor and sexual deviant.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Gus Van Sant", "studio": "NewLineCinema", "theater_date": "Oct 18, 1991", "dvd_date": "Apr 29, 2016", "box_office": "$6.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["My Own Private Idaho may be an operatic arraignment of the class divide that continues to bring shame on America, Van Sant's film gleams brightest when Phoenix, with his wobbly, puppy-dog charisma appears on screen.", "...a great enough idea that it almost doesn't bother me that these stories don't really illuminate one another.", "It misrepresents illness in order to be amusing and Shakespeare in order to seem deep.", "\"My Own Private Idaho\" is both a love story and a tragedy. It remains the high point in Gus Van Sant's career.", "A simultaneously heartbreaking and exhilarating road movie.", "Holding all these elements together is Van Sant's sensibility, such an elusive thing it instinctively squirms away from any attempt to pigeonhole it.", "Although River Phoenix has distinguished himself as an actor ever since his second film, Stand By Me, nothing he has ever done before prepares you for his performance in Private Idaho as the motherless, homeless, loveless piece of human driftwood.", "Cracked and beautiful, stranger than strange, yet in some assuring way so pulsing with life that it embraces you as warmly as Father Knows Best.", "Van Sant proves again that he is masterful at charting the hearts and minds of young people adrift.", "This is a very rich, very sympathetic piece of work.", "[Van Sant] disdain[s] narrative. He got away with Drugstore Cowboy because its band of drugged-out dodoes were engaged in a petty crime spree that almost passed for a plot. But My Own Private Idaho is a different story. Or rather nonstory.", "One of the most original cinematic talents at work in this country, Van Sant has a knack for pulling disparate elements together and twisting them into wildly funny lyrical odysseys of the mind and heart.", "Audacious, controversial, directional, important and totally unique, you'll either love it or hate it. But see it!", "American indie god Gus Van Sant's most iconic moment was this giddily rich revisionist road movie-cum-western.", "The two actors create vivid characters, but they're so unsympathetic and Van Sant drags them through so many tiresome, pretentious scenes that it begins to look as if Phoenix's narcolepsy isn't part of the plot.", "Written and directed by Gus Van Sant, who mingles tremendous visual imagination with a leaning toward off-the-wall situations and sometimes raunchy images.", "Director-writer Gus Van Sant sets up disturbing -- and, often, oddly comic -- situations and then gives his characters (and actors) the freedom to explore them.", "Van Sant takes a lot of chances, and, visually, the movie is so imaginative, so fiercely alive, that it carries us along. But when the over-all design of the picture becomes clear, we feel cheated rather than enlightened.", "The movie weakens every time Mike's story is interrupted by the leaden allusions to Shakespeare.", "It's a very poetic film. That is, it includes images that may mean more to the director than the spectator, but the film is an interesting one."], "rating": ["4/5", "", "", "A+", "", "", "3/4", "3/4", "3/4", "4/4", "", "4/4", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "", "2.5/4", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Jordan M.
