{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Numbers whiz Max Cohen (Sean Gullette) is stunted by psychological delusions of paranoia and debilitating headaches. He lives in a messy Chinatown apartment, where he tinkers with equations and his homemade, super-advanced computer. One day, however, Cohen encounters a mysterious number. Soon after reporting his discovery to his mentor (Mark Margolis) and to a religious friend (Ben Shenkman), he finds himself the target of ill-intentioned Wall Street agents bent on using the number for profit.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Art House & International/Drama/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 25m", "director": "Darren Aronofsky", "studio": "TruthandSoulPictures,ProtozoaPictures,HarvestFilmworks,PlantainFilms", "theater_date": "Jul 10, 1998", "dvd_date": "Oct 12, 2016", "box_office": "$3.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...Aronofsky's taste for including horror in his films is evident from his very first feature...", "Restricted as an up-and-coming filmmaker, Aronofsky didn't conform to convention and instead delivered his art full throttle...", "A workout, no question, and not for everyone, but it has intellectual and spiritual fervor, and even when it stops dead for some mystical exposition, at least it assumes our intelligence (though also our patience).", "A tour-de-force of grainy, high-contrast black-and-white photography and inventive editing and sound design, &#960; at times ventures to the limits of cinematic legibility.", "Pi accomplishes so much more with...its micro-budget than a Hollywood production could.", "a real treat", "", "Both story and style reveal the calculations of an artist so desperate to get noticed that he forgot to cover his id.", "Pi is certainly about the burden of genius, but it very well may also be about mythical powers and faulty dogma in Judaism.", "When the Torah is explained in mathematical terms, it's enough to make you want to take up second year trig - like the movie, a deeply flawed idea.", "Aronofsky, who has parlayed this movie's Sundance success into two Hollywood deals, is that rare indie filmmaker who doesn't want to make hip romantic sitcoms. He's a genuine experimenter with a spooky visual style.", "Disturbing, exhilarating, and sure to send anyone of conservative temperament scuttling from the room.", "We share Max's feelings of imminent psychological disintegration as the film probes our own insecurity in the face of the eternal. Maths meets millennial doom in one of the decade's true originals.", "It's remarkable to what extent Aronofsky has rendered the cerebral kinetically intense. The film's imaginative, diverse images create a mind's-eye urban claustrophobia.", "Clever and creepy as hell.", "...a frustrating and maddeningly confounding piece of work...", "Director Darren Aronofsky creates an eerie Eraserhead-like world that keeps the film compelling.", "An ambitious, stylish and intriguing first effort by Aronofsky and director of photography Matthew Libatique. If you're of a mind for an offbeat but fascinating film, give it a shot.", "Pi is an interesting film. Not a particularly good one, but interesting nonetheless.", "Embora Aronofsky cometa excessos visuais em alguns momentos (tendncia comprovada em seu trabalho seguinte, Rquiem para um Sonho), sua eficiente direo, a tima edio e o inteligente roteiro transformam Pi em um filme singular."], "rating": ["7/10", "4/5", "", "", "A-", "B+", "B", "", "3/4", "B", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "1.5/4", "3/5", "B", "6", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Sarah Boslaugh", "Marisa Mirabal", "Rob Gonsalves", "Gavin Smith", "Christopher Runyon", "John A.
