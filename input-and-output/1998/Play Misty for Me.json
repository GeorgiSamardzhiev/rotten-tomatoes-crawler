{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Popular radio show host Dave Garver (Clint Eastwood) becomes restless in his relationship with his girlfriend (Donna Mills). Impulsively, he goes out and sleeps with a woman (Jessica Walter) he meets at a nightclub. After the fact, he finds out she was not an anonymous hookup, but an obsessive fan who has called in repeatedly to request he play the song \"Misty.\" Garver soon discovers extricating himself from the woman will be no easy feat as she becomes increasingly psychotic.", "rating": "84", "genre": "Mystery & Suspense/Romance", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Clint Eastwood", "studio": "UniversalPictures,MalpasoCompany", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 11, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Misty is a very good thriller, showing that Eastwood had absorbed a great deal from the directors he'd worked for.", "PLAY MISTY FOR ME is a cautionary tale for those who casually choose their lovers; it's a screeching shock to the system", "A crisp and economical picture, this finds Jessica Walter delivering a truly unsettling performance.", "Eastwood and Walter play off each other quite well; he is understated without being dull, while she chews just enough scenery to create a genuine sense of unhinged malice without becoming a cartoon.", "If you're going to film a mystery, once you've got the mystery rolling, you've got to keep it rolling. Play Misty for Me stops and starts and stops and starts so frequently, you get tired of adjusting.", "Eastwood's sideburns and flares lend the movie a period charm today, but its power to grip and chill remains undiminished.", "I was pleasantly surprised.", "Clint Eastwood's first film as a director, and first investigation into the anxiety at the root of the Eastwood persona", "Eastwood displays a vigorous talent for sequences of violence and tension. He has obviously seen Psycho and Repulsion more than once, but those are excellent texts and he has learned his lessons passing well.", "Eastwood's camera is rarely misplaced, and he shows a talent for the thriller genre worthy of a comparison to Hitchcock.", "The star chose to cut his teeth on this small-scale movie, and the result -- although inevitably dated by its terrible clothes and period ambience -- stands up well but only as good late night television viewing.", "Much of the credit must go to Jessica Walter for her outstanding performance which somehow manages to be chilling while at the same time sympathetic.", "For that 80% of the film which constitutes the story, the structure and dialog create a mood of nervous terror which the other 20% nearly blows away.", "Clint Eastwood wisely chose a strong, simple thriller for his first film as a director, and the project is remarkable in its self-effacing dedication to getting the craft right.", "Eastwood's imperfect debut movie is a thiller full of personality and zest.", "Clint's direction is sometimes shaky but usually assured, and he gets a bold performance from Jessica Walter.", "The Man With No Name faces a whole lot of pain in Clint's thrilling directorial debut.", "A highly enjoyable thriller.", "Un suspense qui profita abondamment de la largesse d'esprit du cinma amricain de l'poque, peut-tre mme un peu trop...", ""], "rating": ["", "B+", "3/4", "3/4", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "", "3.5/5", "", "", "3/5", "4/5", "4/5", "", "5/10", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Dennis Harvey", "James Clay", "Matt Brunson", "James Kendrick", "Terry Alan Smith", "Tony Sloman", "Dohoro", "Fernando F.
