{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this tale of how love binds 11 random people from Los Angeles, a married couple (Sean Connery, Gena Rowlands) prepare to renew vows; a widowed mother (Ellen Burstyn) cares for a dying son (Jay Mohr) ; a couple (Madeleine Stowe, Anthony Edwards) have an affair; a theater director (Gillian Anderson) strikes up a relationship with a stranger (Jon Stewart) ; an aspiring actress (Angelina Jolie) pursues a shy young man and a lone man (Dennis Quaid) talks of heartbreak to strangers.", "rating": "60", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 1m", "director": "Willard Carroll", "studio": "MiramaxFilms", "theater_date": "Jan 22, 1999", "dvd_date": "Oct 15, 2016", "box_office": "$4.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Carroll's milieu is resolutely middle class and the crises encountered all too predictable.", "", "Carroll's characters spend so much time talking, albeit intelligently, that the connections they make seem peculiarly synthetic.", "This charming romantic comedy with a Los Angeles setting cuts between seemingly unconnected miniplots the way some Robert Altman movies do.", "All of these characters are more interesting when things are going badly for them than when the tide has turned, and Carroll's determination to make the final reel an extended bout of audience tummy tickling is disappointingly conventional.", "A very slight and inoffensive movie. It's a lot like L.A. itself, all surface, soothing and warm.", "The brightest spot belongs to Angelina Jolie, who is so compelling to watch she has chemistry with the furniture.", "Playing By Heart tries hard and sometimes succeeds -- and Jolie is terrific.", "Nothing more than merely watchable film.", "", "The dozen or so lead characters of Playing By Heart fear silence the way Biblical people feared locusts.", "An underrated, dreamy drama about love, lust and infidelity amongst inter-connected Los Angeleans. Jolie rises to the challenge.", "The lack of time gives the last reel a fakey, tied-up-with-a-bow feeling, but good performances and a good script make this an enjoyable little romance.", "", "An intriguing patchwork of relationships converges into a portrait of modern love in Playing By Heart, a wry, satisfying emotional saga.", "A heavily mixed bag; high points come with Jon Stewart's sweet courtship of Gillian Anderson and a brilliant turn from a young unknown named Angelina Jolie.", "The script's overall artifice, combined with a convenient burst of \"I love yous\" and an all-too-obvious surprise ending, work to undermine an otherwise interesting concept.", "Willard Carroll's cleverly interconnected (sometimes annoyingly so) tale of six different relationships is populated by a horde of big-name stars...", "", "A well-scripted ensemble drama about eleven people in Los Angeles searching for love."], "rating": ["", "C+", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "3/5", "B-", "3/10", "2/4", "D", "4/5", "4.5/5", "2/5", "", "3/5", "", "", "2.5/4", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Lael Loewenstein", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Derek Adams", "Jeffrey M.
