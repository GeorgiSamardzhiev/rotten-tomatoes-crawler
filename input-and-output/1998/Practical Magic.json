{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Sally (Sandra Bullock) and Gillian Owens (Nicole Kidman), born into a magical family, have mostly avoided witchcraft themselves. But when Gillian's vicious boyfriend, Jimmy Angelov (Goran Visnjic), dies unexpectedly, the Owens sisters give themselves a crash course in hard magic. With policeman Gary Hallet (Aidan Quinn) growing suspicious, the girls struggle to resurrect Angelov -- and unwittingly inject his corpse with an evil spirit that threatens to end their family line.", "rating": "22", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Drama/Kids & Family/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Griffin Dunne", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,DiNoviPictures,FortisFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 1, 2009", "box_office": "$46.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["From blood moons to self-stirring spoons and long luscious locks, the Owens women are a magical brood.", "The picture's hopelessly uninvolving feel is especially disappointing given Bullock and Kidman's typically charismatic work...", "It may be quirky, bizarre and in some places very clunky, but Practical Magic deserves a second chance.", "Unfortunately, this is The Witches of Eastwick with its humour and sizzle removed.", "Filming in a golden-syrupy light, Dunne seems to have little ambition beyond making his stars look adorable (not tricky) and hoping we'll have forgotten most of The Witches of Eastwick.", "[An] inane and insipid effort beset by ponderous plotting.", "Essentially a sibling soap-opera with a dash of mumbo-jumbo.", "Practical Magic has its flaws. Some scenes are weak, occasionally lines are a little muddled, and there is some plot underdevelopment. Yet it is daring and fun.", "It doesn't seem as if there was much communication between the three screenwriters who are credited with adapting Alice Hoffman's novel. Perhaps they should have tried ESP.", "Practical Magic, in other words, is anything but magical. The only spell it casts will put you right to sleep.", "Without a consistent tone or any real measure of emotional consistency, Practical Magic occasionally manages to bubble, but it's barely worth the toil and trouble.", "Bullock and Kidman are both wonderful actresses, and watching them for two hours could never be called a chore. But even they seem to have trouble pinning the movie down.", "Practical Magic has little chemistry and less movie magic.", "However many stories the movie tries to tackle from Alice Hoffman's original novel, the moments that have lived beyond Practical Magic's expected expiration date celebrate sisterhood with a fierce heart and love that blazes across cities.", "Though its startling shifts in tone sometimes seem unmotivated, this dark yet syrupy 1998 romance has an adolescent charm.", "It tootles along being cute... but to further its notions of sisterhood and the power of women, it also takes a spin through Thelma And Louise territory, then revisits The Exorcist to up the supernatural content. It's enough to make your head spin.", "Though the tale is not without its charms, its spell is repeatedly broken by the random pace and tone.", "ts flat whimsy, VH1-ready musical montage sequences, and less-than-magic magic realism will probably not be enough to hold the attention of all but the most undiscriminating fans of witches and Stockard Channing.", "As witch movies go -- even lighthearted, supposedly comic witch movies -- Practical Magic is conspicuously lacking in supernatural phenomena.", "Mind-boggling miscalculations strangle this adaptation of Alice Hoffman's popular novel before it can find its feet."], "rating": ["5/5", "2/4", "", "2/5", "", "", "", "2/4", "1/4", "", "2/4", "1.5/4", "C-", "", "", "2/5", "", "", "", "1.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Sez\u00edn Koehler", "David Nusair", "Becky Kukla", "Jo Berry", "Anthony Quinn", "Michael Dwyer", "Xan Brooks", "Garth Stahl", "Jami Bernard", "Jay Boyar", "Dennis King", "Chris Kaltenbach", "Laura Clifford", "Caroline Framke", "Lisa Alspector", "Angie Errigo", "Rita Kempley", "Keith Phipps", "Bill Gallo", "Maitland McDonagh"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Black Girl Nerds", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Inquiry", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Irish Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent on Sunday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reeling Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Vox", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide"], "date": ["May 23, 2020", "March 1, 2020", "June 7, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019"]}}
