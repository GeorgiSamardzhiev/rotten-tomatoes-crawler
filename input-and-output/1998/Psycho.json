My mom, Geraldine Calleri enjoyed seeing Hitchcock's films. You couldn't have found a more appreciative audience.", "It is the ultimate example of how the medium can sway our thought process ... It is the art form operating at its highest capability.", "Psycho  remains one of the ten best horror films ever made. Hitchcock balances comedy, sex, and death at a knife's edge, creating a riveting story from start to finish.", "A supremely thrilling murder mystery that boasts a climax unlike any other.", "Hitchcock's black & white classic is a masterclass in directing, tone and acting performances. Definitely ahead of its time. [Full review in Spanish]", "Psycho is that rarest of beasts - it's both art and entertainment. It's also Hitchcock's best film.", "Even though Psycho isn't as terrifying under today's cinematic standards, the film stands out as one of Alfred Hitchcock's finest achievements.", "Psycho comes nearer to attaining an exhilarating balance between content and style than anything Hitchcock has done in years. Of course, it is a very minor work. But its virtues of tension, surprise, virtuosity and control are all major ones.", "Alfred Hitchcock's latest is not his customary comedy-thriller but a gruesome horror tale with overtones of spiritualism and the padded cell, although as usual the master's tongue is occasionally in his cheek.", "The beauty of Psycho is also that it is an art film masquerading as a genre film; though it is not in any way remote or inaccessible.", "I think the film is a reflection of a most unpleasant mind, a mean, sly, sadistic little mind.", "Hitchcock ingeniously puts himself one step ahead of us. They don't call him the master for nothing: we're just followers, guinea pigs he's tickled to toy with.", "It is one of [Hitchcock's] most brilliantly directed shockers and also his most disagreeable.", "A brilliant technical exercise, an intimate character study, and the ultimate variant on the premise \"boy meets girl.\"", "Psycho continues to be thrilling to this day.", "The film has its authentic moments of visual shock that make you sit up with sheet whistling admiration... I just feel Hitchcock has over-rated what he was up to in Psycho.", "The legendary director's best picture.", "Paramount won't let anyone enter theatres where Psycho is playing after the picture starts. No one will want to leave before it is over.", "The obvious thing to say is that Hitch has done it again; that the suspense of his picture builds up slowly but surely to an almost unbearable pitch of excitement.", "Even now, it's distinctly unnerving."], "rating": ["", "", "4/4", "1", "4.5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "", "", "5/5", "", "", "", "", "A+", "", "4/4", "", "4/4", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Michael Calleri", "Allen Almachar", "Alan French", "Mike Massie", "Fico Cangiano", "Matt Neal", "Danielle Solzman", "Peter John Dyer", "Clyde Gilmour", "PJ Nabarro", "Dwight MacDonald", "C.J.
