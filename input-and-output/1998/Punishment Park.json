{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this fictional documentary, U.S. prisons are at capacity, and President Nixon declares a state of emergency. All new prisoners, most of whom are connected to the antiwar movement, are now given the choice of jail time or spending three days in Punishment Park, where they will be hunted for sport by federal authorities. The prisoners invariably choose the latter option, but learn that, between the desert heat and the brutal police officers, their chances of survival are slim.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Classics/Documentary/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Peter Watkins", "studio": "Chartwell", "theater_date": "Mar 14, 1973", "dvd_date": "Oct 27, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The most offensive of the recent Festival films I have seen to date.", "Punishment Park is seminal political cinema of the highest order.", "Shot in cin\u00e9ma-v\u00e9rit\u00e9 style and presented as pseudo-documentary, its message is all the more powerful, resonating long after the credits have rolled.", "Shot during the post-Kent State \"law and order\" election of 1970, Punishment Park can seem so outrageous as to verge on camp, but few other movies capture so painfully the rhetoric and desperation of the times.", "an extraordinary film - provocative, incendiary and deeply depressing.
