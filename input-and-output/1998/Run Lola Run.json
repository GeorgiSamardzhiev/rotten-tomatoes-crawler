{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this visually and conceptually impressive film, two-bit Berlin criminal Manni (Moritz Bleibtreu) delivers some smuggled loot for his boss, Ronnie (Heino Ferch), but accidentally leaves the 100,000 mark payment in a subway car. Given 20 minutes to come up with the money, he calls his girlfriend, Lola (Franka Potente), who sprints through the streets of the city to try to beg the money out of her bank manager father (Herbert Knaup) and get to Manni before he does something desperate.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Art House & International/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 21m", "director": "Tom Tykwer", "studio": "Arte,WestdeutscherRundfunk,X-FilmeCreativePool", "theater_date": "Jun 18, 1999", "dvd_date": "Aug 23, 2016", "box_office": "$7.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Pure avant-garde filmmaking, wholly succeeding at presenting innovative editing techniques to lure the audience into a plot as nonlinear and sporadic as they come.", "An exercise in sensory overload.", "...a gimmicky thriller that's almost as much miss as it is hit.", "", "Teenagers with a taste for the offbeat may enjoy.", "", "", "Run Lola Run takes a few moments to muse about the nature of time and the purpose of man...
