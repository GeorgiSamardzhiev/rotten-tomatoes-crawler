{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When a beautiful first-grade teacher (Olivia Williams) arrives at a prep school, she soon attracts the attention of an ambitious teenager named Max (Jason Schwartzman), who quickly falls in love with her.

However, the situation soon gets complicated when Max's new friend becomes involved with her, setting the two pals against one another in a war for her attention.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Wes Anderson", "studio": "TouchstonePictures,AmericanEmpiricalPictures", "theater_date": "Feb 5, 1999", "dvd_date": "Aug 30, 2014", "box_office": "$17.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Schwartzman is cautious but stubbornly optimistic, while Murray is possessed by the mania of near-despair... They make the best and most disconcerting odd couple that American movies have produced in a long while.", "Rushmore is an almost indefinable genre of its own. A comedy with a menacing edge? An ironic romance? Hard to call. Anderson, the director and co-writer, and Wilson, co-writer, have a vision like no one else's.", "A quirky, sometimes hilarious and often touching comic fable.", "There's an unshakable confidence about this coming-of-age fable that matches that of its central character, Max Fischer.", "Rushmore offers more than simply a series of high-grade yuks; it's a finely-judged parable on the line between self-delusion and reality.", "If happiness is finding something you love to do and doing it forever, one of my somethings might just be watching this oddly uproarious little flick.", "Anderson fulfills the promise of his inventive Bottle Rocket with this quirky, often hilarious comedy, and Murray gives his most uproarious performance since the groundbreaking Groundhog Day.", "Despite cute moments, nothing about Rushmore begs to be liked, which makes this modest comedy all the more satisfying.", "A gloriously inventive little comedy about the scholastic and romantic woes of a 15-year-old student at a private academy.", "Just when you expect the film to do something normal, it takes off like Murray -- riffing on reality as only he, and filmmaker Anderson, can.", "It's somehow fitting that in this Maxcentric universe, Rushmore exists as a satirical comedy, full of dry wit and adolescent absurdities, and a bittersweet valentine to manipulative misfits who actually find the love they deserve.", "There's a danger of overselling Anderson's sweet-hearted, loony little fantasy, but everything -- from the soundtrack of '60s Brit bands with their jangly anthems of angsty love to Robert Yeoman's slightly hyper-real photography -- fits perfectly.", "An inspired second feature from director Wes Anderson and co-writer Owen Wilson, the picture shares the offbeat rhythms and disarming humor of their overlooked debut, Bottle Rocket.", "The hint of genuine pathos [Murray] brings to Rushmore tempers Schwartzman's brash, sometimes off-putting antics, gracing an already great comedy with surprising depth and heart.", "Bill Murray -- playing a depressed millionaire -- steals every scene in this quirky, edgy and very funny tale of an outsider who just might end up leading all those who laugh at him.", "Rushmore is accurate enough on the teen-angst front to make you wince, yet whimsical enough to make you want Max to win.", "One of the freshest, richest, most original films to come out of Hollywood in a very long time.", "Bill Murray projects a seriocomic intensity here comparable to Charlie Chaplin's classic Little Tramp.", "Rushmore may have shades of J.D. Salinger's writing and Hal Ashby's movies, but Wes Anderson pulls humor from the trickiest of situations and always manages to surprise.", "Probably of more interest to adults than to teens."], "rating": ["", "", "", "4/4", "4/5", "", "4/4", "4/4", "", "3/4", "4.5/5", "4/4", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "4/4", "", "4/4", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Anthony Lane", "Desson Thomson", "Jonathan Foreman", "John Hartl", "Andrew Pulver", "Jay Boyar", "David Sterritt", "Ann Hornaday", "Leah Rozen", "Dan Webster", "Serena Donadoni", "Steven Rea", "Rita Kempley", "Scott Tobias", "Jo Berry", "", "Dave Kehr", "Betty Jo Tucker", "Eric Melin", "Nell Minow"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spokesman-Review (Washington)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro Times (Detroit, MI)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ReelTalk Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Scene-Stealers.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media"], "date": ["March 17, 2014", "March 17, 2014", "March 17, 2014", "March 17, 2014", "March 17, 2014", "March 17, 2014", "March 17, 2014", "March 17, 2014", "March 17, 2014", "March 17, 2014", "March 17, 2014", "March 17, 2014", "March 17, 2014", "March 17, 2014", "March 17, 2014", "March 17, 2014", "March 7, 2014", "April 21, 2012", "December 9, 2011", "December 28, 2010"]}}
