{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When an eclectic group of passengers boards a cruise ship bound for prewar Germany, they form a microcosm of 1930s society. One passenger, a mysterious countess (Simone Signoret), is headed for a German prison camp. The charming Dr. Schumann (Oskar Werner) harbors a debilitating heart condition. Then there's American divorc\u00e9e Mary Treadwell (Vivien Leigh), who vainly attempts to outrun time itself. During their weeks at sea, the group forges bonds and rivalries, and unearths secrets.", "rating": "72", "genre": "Classics/Documentary/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 29m", "director": "Stanley Kramer", "studio": "StanleyKramerProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The result, in both book and movie, is a Ship without buoyancy and with an alarming tendency to wallow in heavy seas.", "This is the worst movie that Mr. Kramer has yet directed, if the verb may be used, loosely, in this context.", "Superb acting in an Abby Mann script that seldom descends into bathos.", "Director-producer Stanley Kramer and scenarist Abby Mann have distilled the essence of Katherine Anne Porter's bulky novel in a film that appeals to the intellect and the emotions.", "Prestigious and literary cinema at its most ponderous, transfer of Porter's novel to the the big screen by Kramer (the wrong director) is crude and pretentious, but some of the performances, particularly Signoret, Leigh and Dunn, are good.", "The black-and-white overlong, dated and uneven film, a less than endearing talk-fest, is rescued from drowning in a sea of words by its fine cast.", "Don't look now, but as you might expect with message-mad Kramer at the helm of this adaptation of Katherine Anne Porter's novel, there's a heavy allegory aboard.", "", "All-star cast in ultimately grim tale.", "", "", "The film's interest lies in the excellent cast.", "", "A powerful, ironic film.", "", "It makes for OK drama all the same, but it's all on the heavy-handed side.
