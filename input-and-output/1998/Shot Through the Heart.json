Vlado is a Muslim and Slavko is a Serb, meaning they are on opposing sides of the conflict. Being an expert sniper, Slavko fires at civilians in Vlado's neighborhood. Consequently, Vlado turns down Slavko's offer to flee the country and instead becomes a freedom fighter. The old friends confront each other and must decide on their true allegiances.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "David Attwood", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 30, 2005", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": [""], "rating": ["2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten"], "critic": ["Philip Martin"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette"], "date": ["July 26, 2002"]}}
