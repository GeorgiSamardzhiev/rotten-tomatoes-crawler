I found it mildly interesting at best.", "It's just an incredibly insightful character drama about true, awkward, beautiful first love, and it's all the better for it. Oh, and that last shot is as cute as it gets.", "It's an awkward, unapologetic, unconventional -- and ultimately winning -- look at first love, one that unabashedly portrays the complications and confusion that result from those first crushes and rushes of attraction and passion.", "High school, small town, teenagers in hormone hell -- or is that heaven?", "The two lead performances by Dahlstroem and Liljeberg are entirely naturalistic.", "...a warm coming-of-age story that happens to be a coming-out story."], "rating": ["", "", "B-", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "4/5", "3/5", "3/4", "4/5", "3.5/4", "5/5", "", "", "3.5/4", "B+", "3/4", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Alyx Vesey", "David Ansen", "Dennis Schwartz", "Ken Fox", "Lisa Alspector", "Jeffrey M.
