{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Simon Birch (Ian Michael Smith) and Joe Wenteworth (Joseph Mazzello) are boys who have a reputation for being oddballs. Joe never knew his father, and his mother, Rebecca (Ashley Judd), is keeping her lips sealed, no matter how much he protests. Simon, meanwhile, is an 11-year-old dwarf whose outsize personality belies his small stature. Indeed, he often assails the local reverend (David Strathairn) with thorny theological questions and joins Joe on his quest to find his biological father.", "rating": "44", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Mark Steven Johnson", "studio": "HollywoodPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$18.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "", "", "Great, overlooked film.", "", "Wonderfully performed and syrupy sweet", "", "", "A rare and wonderful testament to the ardor and resilience of faith.
