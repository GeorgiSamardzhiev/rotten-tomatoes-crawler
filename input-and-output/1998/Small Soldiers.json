Alan gets caught in the middle of the war, as does his neighbor and crush, Christy (Kirsten Dunst).", "rating": "48", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 50m", "director": "Joe Dante", "studio": "UniversalPictures,DreamWorksSKG,AmblinEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 1, 2016", "box_office": "$55.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Small Soldiers deserves to be re-evaluated, which fortunately also means that it can finally be enjoyed, too.", "Works as an adventure film and another fine Joe Dante creature feature...", "", "Smart satirical action-comedy about talking action toys.", "", "An infomercial with the schmaltz that passes for emotion in family-aimed films.", "Typical of Dante's films, Small Soldiers is an unbroken string of pop culture in-jokes.", "", "", "It looks like the movie was edited down from a much meaner version, to our loss.", "...an entertaining romp...", "The animation is excellent, and the voice cast alone is worth the price of admission...", "...this smells like a script slapped together around a toy-product launch.", "", "Though it starts promisingly, the picture ends as a standoff between the affection Dante and company bring to the project and its increasingly frenetic and tiresome emphasis on what special effects can make its little people do.", "", "...wildly entertaining...", "", "", "A charmless and often mean-spirited 'kids' movie' that no kid under eight should be taken to see."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "", "C+", "A-", "2/5", "2.5/4", "3/4", "2/4", "2.5/5", "2/5", "3/4", "3/5", "2/4", "2.5/4", "3/5", "2.5/4", "3/4", "2/5", "3/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Jeffrey M.
