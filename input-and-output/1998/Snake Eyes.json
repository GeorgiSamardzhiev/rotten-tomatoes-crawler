{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Detective Rick Santoro (Nicolas Cage) has never played by the rules. When he attends a high-profile boxing match with his friend Navy Cmdr. Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise), as well as Defense Secretary Kirkland (Joel Fabiani), he witnesses a terrorist assassinate Kirkland. Despite a lockdown on the arena, key witness Julia Costello (Carla Gugino) escapes -- and Santoro begins to suspect Kirkland's death is part of a much larger conspiracy that involves boxing rivals and a beautiful stranger.", "rating": "41", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "Brian De Palma", "studio": "TouchstonePictures,ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$55.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's immediately impossible to mistake Snake Eyes for anything than a vintage De Palma thriller...", "", "De Palma continues perfecting his brilliant visual style within the most blatantly artificial plot scenarios.", "", "Brian De Palma's exercise in flashy paranoia and shallow cynicism comes out of the gate like gangbusters, but falls apart in a flurry of preposterous plotting.", "Wispy threads of dramatic plausibility and character involvement unravel completely by the time of the incredibly silly final reel.", "Aside from a sensational, continuous 20-minute opening take, and an amazing shot that literally swoops over the top of a row of hotel rooms, there's little of interest here.", "Never loses its bearings as it hovers between preposterous paranoia and a Billy-Wilder-like moral fable about a deeply flawed hero who draws a line in the sand beyond which he cannot go.", "Snake Eyes is about multiple perceptions of one major event, their relationship to each other and to the audience.", "The first 20 minutes of Snake Eyes are among the most imaginative and energetic minutes of film I've seen in a while.", "The film echoes the technical wizardry and complex plotting of De Palma's best film, Blow Out.", "A moderately suspenseful thriller that seems somewhat conventional compared to De Palma's earlier envelope-pushing efforts. Intriguing, but the mystery villain is rather obvious from the start.", "Unfortunately, the material that De Palma chooses to hang his flair on feels like a paltry version of No Way Out as if penned by Crichton or Grisham.", "I give De Palma and company credit for not succumbing to the usual bloat we see in big-budget Hollywood films.", "", "The mundane plot of Snake Eyes is disguised with lots of camera razzle-dazzle.", "Promises to be a masterpiece, only to succumb to Hollywood mediocrity -- just like its director.", "Instantly forgettable, but good fun while it lasts.", "A dazzling piece of entertainment -- a mystery so cleverly constructed you find yourself wanting to see it again before it's over.", "DePalma, a director who chooses his projects carefully, has scored again."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "D", "", "3/4", "2/4", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "3/4", "3/5", "B-", "1/5", "1.5/4", "4/10", "B", "3.5/4", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Nusair", "Owen Gleiberman", "Rob Nelson", "Susan Stark", "Maitland McDonagh", "Todd McCarthy", "", "Andrew Sarris", "Paul Schrodt", "Jeffrey M.
