World doesn't stop spinning long enough to answer.", "This film barely manages to tell a story at all.", "\"What's the plot?\" you may be asking. Well so am I.", "A promotional tool that establishes its superfluousness simply by existing, this clumsy, smirking movie has a bitter soul.", "Full of silly, swirling fantasy sequences and breezy backstage glimpses into their ``lives'' - not to mention an album's worth of new tunes - Spice World offers a fanciful view of fame and female camaraderie in the fabulous '90s.", "Spice World is a smart vehicle for the Girls, a cheerful and occasionally witty self-parody that does for the Spices what Help! and A Hard Day's Night did for the Beatles.", "Spiers makes what was conceived by the Fullers as an album plug play as an actual movie. Though it will doubtless pain many a critic to say so, Spice World is a kick.", "The first (and as it transpired only) feature film to exploit the enormous success of pop quintet the Spice Girls, this is an attempt to capture the comedic style of the Beatles films, and not nearly as bad as it might have been.", "A movie about four months too late to endure in the pop-culture annals and about four stars too short to be a four-star movie.", "As an example of pop-culture debris, Spice World is absolutely perfect. Without, of course, being any good.", "The result is tiresome and a blown opportunity to launch the group to an entirely new audience. And I suspect those who already are fans will learn nothing new about their \"Girl Power\" heroes.", "Spice World is about as awful and shamelessly pandering as a fanzine movie could dare to be.", "Loony mockumentary captures Spice Girl fever.", "This movie wasn't so much written as dripped. It's a fine waste of time for nine-year-olds.", "I actually prayed for the songs. The singing scenes were far less vapid than the ones where the acting was trying to happen.", "Spice World will delight the Fab Five's pre-pubescent fans, recall fond memories of the '60s to those who actually lived through them, and be forgotten within six months.", "Probably a coin-toss victory against a Spice Babies Saturday morning cartoon."], "rating": ["2/10", "2/5", "2.5/4", "1.5/4", "2/10", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "2/5", "", "", "1/4", "", "3/5", "D", "", "", "2.5/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "PJ Nabarro", "David Nusair", "Mike Clark", "Jim Judy", "Paul Tatara", "Lisa Alspector", "Steven Rea", "Jami Bernard", "Sean Piccoli", "Andrew Collins", "David Kronke", "Jay Boyar", "Gene Siskel", "Desson Thomson", "Heather Boerner", "Cole Smithey", "Jon Popick", "Derek Elley", "Jesse Hassenger"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">USA Today", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen It!", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNN.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rec.arts.movies.reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmcritic.com"], "date": ["September 24, 2020", "November 4, 2018", "January 24, 2018", "January 9, 2018", "August 23, 2017", "June 21, 2016", "June 21, 2016", "June 21, 2016", "June 21, 2016", "June 21, 2016", "June 21, 2016", "June 21, 2016", "June 21, 2016", "June 21, 2016", "June 21, 2016", "December 18, 2010", "May 19, 2009", "January 7, 2009", "July 22, 2008", "October 17, 2007"]}}
