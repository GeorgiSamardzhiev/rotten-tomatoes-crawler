{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Three years after divorcing Jackie (Susan Sarandon), the mother of his children, Luke Harrison (Ed Harris) decides to take the next step with his significantly younger girlfriend, fashion photographer Isabel Kelly (Julia Roberts). But, when the flaky Kelly meets Harrison's children for the first time, their fierce allegiance to their mother is obvious. Try as she might, Kelly fails to endear herself to her young charges -- and to Jackie -- until a looming family crisis changes everything.", "rating": "46", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 4m", "director": "Chris Columbus", "studio": "TriStarPictures,1492Pictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$91.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It earns its tears with great performances and good writing", "If you're going to make children say such terrible things, you should at least back it up with a movie about divorce and death that is sincere and penetrating. In other words, the type of film that Chris Columbus wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole.", "It's a lovely daydream, made lovelier by the fiercely maternal performance of Sarandon as a lioness protecting her cubs, and Julia Roberts as a mass of insecurity trying to measure up to impossible standards.", "Stepmom is a piece of formulaic Hollywood product that's barely redeemed by its three fine leads and top notch production values. It suffers in comparison to the similar, but far better, One True Thing.", "Were it not for the stellar acting of Sarandon (the most infectious weeper this side of Brenda Blethyn) and Julia Roberts (irresistible as ever) the whole predictable enterprise would be too mawkish for words.", "Stepmom is highly effective filmmaking, eliciting its fair share of laughter and sobs, even though the least gullible moviegoers will be able to see all the melodramatic machinery cranking and groaning behind the curtains.", "Though Stepmom has its ups and downs, it shows Columbus as a director who has graduated to adulthood after his two Home Alone hits without losing sight of the struggles of children.", "The critic feels cheated, but all around him the audience is happily weeping.", "Well, if unearned pathos is your cup of tea, drink up.", "Under Chris Columbus' direction, they make a pretty but utterly misleading picture in which cheap sentiment is used to supply easy, false resolutions to agonizing issues.", "Roberts holds her own with a very attractive performance, admittedly given that hers is the character who is likeable, good-humoured and too good to be true.", "The result is a cartoonish two-hour-plus soap opera of little distinction, played by actors who deserve better and should have known better.", "A disjointed hybrid of domestic comedy and mortal illness that might have been written by a support group of lobotomy survivors.", "Despite its unappealing title, this is an incredibly touching and sophisticated film about life after divorce that examines the tricky issue of bringing a new partner into the family set-up.", "It is hard to credit that it took five credited writers to assemble this slender, contrived and heavily padded concoction, directed with unremitting blandness by Chris Columbus.", "Much of Stepmom's success is due to its three appealing lead players, all of whom lend class and intelligence to the enterprise.", "Chris Columbus directs as if he's handling a moral diagram: Stepmom is so full of understanding it made me want to throw up.", "It's a film about a woman who lives for other people and who wears the requisite hunted expression. If this woman wasn't Sarandon, then Stepmom would be altogether hopeless.", "[Stepmom] offers some useful insights into how feelings of jealousy and betrayal can limit the potential of family relationships. But these ideas are more or less undermined by the movie's maddeningly typical glamorizing of illness.", "Stepmom plays just this side of icky, pulling at the heartstrings as if hitched to a Mack truck."], "rating": ["7.5/10", "1/5", "3/4", "C", "", "2.5/4", "3/4", "", "", "", "3/5", "2/4", "", "4/5", "", "3/4", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Rachel Wagner", "Daniel Barnes", "Jami Bernard", "Laura Clifford", "Todd Anthony", "Dennis King", "Malcolm Johnson", "Brian D.
