{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A pierced and tattooed sadist, Captain Howdy (Dee Snider), trolls the Internet for naive teens, luring them to his home to torture and defile them. When Howdy kidnaps and tortures the daughter of police Detective Mike Gage (Kevin Gage), he is caught. Deemed insane, he is sent to an asylum but is released soon after, seemingly better. However, Gage knows it is only a matter of time before Howdy strikes again, and he's ready to unleash his own form of retribution when the time comes.", "rating": "6", "genre": "Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 26m", "director": "John Pieplow", "studio": "ArtisanEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 8, 2016", "box_office": "$631.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "This terrible horror film pretends to tell a moral about internet chat rooms, but really it's a cheap C grade slasher flick.", "a little too messy for me", "", "Snider's Captain Howdy is an appropriately scary creation, but the movie mostly lets him down.", "", "", "After the agonizing torture that was endured I can safely make the statement that Strangeland is now and will be the worst film of 1998.", "", "", "It's a disturbing, hopeless, irredeemable series of images that will scar you if you wander into it unprepared.", "Painful to endure even by modern primitive standards, it's a freaky, funless wreck, intolerable in the extreme.", "Entry into the realm of disappointing horror videos.", "Perhaps if I hadn't expected it to be so bad I might have approved of it less.", "The kind of movie where you want to take a bath after watching.", "Twisted Sister's Dee Snider makes a movie -- a must-see, right?
