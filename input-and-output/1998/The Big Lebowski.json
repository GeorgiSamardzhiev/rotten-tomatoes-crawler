Jeff Bridges and John Goodman standout in the stoner comedy film to rule them all. [Full review in Spanish]", "The dialogue is riddled with moody, witty cursing and unequalled wordplay - and all sorts of sarcastic nonsense.", "A frantic mish-mash of comedy, mystery, and cinematic trickery that, while it can be overwhelming at first glance, is one of the most unique and entertaining films in a generation.", "I could tell you how much I love this movie but that's just, like, my opinion, man.", "If The Dude is the representative figure of early 1990s America - a lazy white guy constantly breaking the law with impunity - it's no wonder his story remains relevant even now that the film is old enough to order its own White Russian.", "The comedy largely centers itself on Bridges, whose blissfully nonplussed reaction shots always provide a grounding effect for the rest of the movie.", "For those of you who forgot how good Bridges was in The Fisher King, here is a reminder. As the gung-ho Nam veteran, Goodman's tenacious, tightly coiled demeanor is smartly explosive and very funny.", "What made Fargo work, aside from the regional kitsch, was a solid story and believable characters worth caring about. The Big Lebowski has neither.", "The Big Lebowski (1998) is a dark, idiosyncratic and quirky comedy/crime caper-thriller involving an intriguing complex case of mistaken identity, deception, double-crosses, and a mysterious kidnapping. It came from the inventive, cultish...", "\"The Big Lebowski\" is easy to love and rewarding to obsess over, but for me, it's more than just a fun movie to quote; it's a comforting memory generator, and when I watch it, if I squint, I can kind of see my dad again.", "Already a pessimistic take on the American Dream and the ideal of the self-made man, the model of the film-noir detective is ridiculed in The Big Lebowski.", "Lebowski's virtuosity serves a sense of modesty.", "One of a kind.", "If one were to examine the entire cinematic resume of the Coen Brothers, The Big Lebowskiwould assuredly rest within the top five spots.", "I'll just say this: The Big Lebowksi is an excellent movie - and damn funny.", "A return to form... where large men scream very loudly and jokes are pounded into the ground with vigor and brio. Goodman's Walter is a bullet-headed, barely contained titan of rage, running on the fumes of cracked beliefs and fierce garble-gabble.", "The Big Lebowski is a noir send-up, so call it L.A. Inconsequential.", "Hilarious, well-written, and well-performed by both Bridges and Goodman, The Big Lebowski blows other more recent slacker comedies out the water and proves that Bridges can do any role.", "It's like, you know, pretty groovy, man."], "rating": ["", "3/5", "1", "A", "A+", "3/5", "4.5/5", "", "", "A+", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "4/4", "9/10", "3/4", "B+", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jonah Koslofsky", "Fico Cangiano", "Mike Massie", "Brent McKnight", "Brian Gill", "Sez\u00edn Koehler", "Tim Brayton", "Duane Byrge", "Brian D.
