{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Rising teen boxer and Belfast native Danny Flynn (Daniel Day-Lewis) was imprisoned for 14 years after getting involved with the Irish Republican Army. Newly freed from jail in his early 30s, Danny returns home and attempts to put his life back together. Reopening his neighborhood gym and reconnecting with his lost love, Maggie (Emily Watson), now a single mother while her husband is in prison, Danny battles against his former IRA compadres, including the militant Harry (Gerard McSorley).", "rating": "80", "genre": "Drama/Sports & Fitness", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Jim Sheridan", "studio": "UniversalPictures,Hell&#39;sKitchenFilms", "theater_date": "Dec 19, 1997", "dvd_date": "Mar 5, 2016", "box_office": "$5.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It is well acted and directed... It's just the script that could have been a little more memorable.", "In each film he makes, Day-Lewis seems to adopt a new persona.", "What makes The Boxer as potent as it is are the performances, especially Daniel Day-Lewis' contained powerhouse. His Danny is a closed-off man, shadowboxing with his private demons, who comes painfully, but gloriously, back to life.", "An intelligent, provocative piece of cinema, with something quite bold to say in the Irish context.", "A knock-out performance by Daniel Day-Lewis is the highlight of this admirable if rather conventional drama.", "We never figure out, though, what drives Day-Lewis' Danny. We just take it on faith that he's stubborn and sick of violence. The filmmakers don't help much, offering just a twist on the star-crossed lovers story, mixed with standard boxing melodrama.", "The art-house dream-team pairing of Daniel Day-Lewis and Emily Watson amounts to more of a soft jab than a knockout punch.", "Day-Lewis has the ability to make the will to nonviolence look positively volcanic. And Watson, with her 200-watt incandescence, makes longing look radiant.", "In this dull film, poignant characters caught up in histrionics flail with one glove, while much emotional shadowboxing is done with the other.", "If The Boxer doesn't quite score a knockout, that's because of such flaws as the too-sketchy development of the character of Maggie's son, who turns out to be pivotal. But the movie carries the day by aiming its strongest punches straight at the heart.", "It still packs a knockout punch thanks to Day-Lewis' typically gutsy performance.", "With Watson and Day-Lewis you can almost feel the heat, and their situation never feels contrived or artificial.", "One of Sheridan's best.", "The critic dutifully tabulated each blunt plot point, each refried cliche.. And yet, when Danny's nemesis did something monstrously rotten, the critic was so enraged by the dastardly act that he had to stop himself from spitting his candy.", "Though we've seen this unquiet terrain before, this new film about boxing, star-crossed lovers and the Irish Republican Army temporarily gives us fresh eyes.", "The Boxer is very observant about the ways in which women are enlisted in the IRA cause.", "The screenplay of The Boxer spends too much time and energy setting up the basic situations of its plot, then does a spotty job of blending the material's personal and political aspects.", "This is acting that stands apart from fashionable styles.", "Despite its strengths, romantic staying power and a surprise ending, The Boxer has begun to lose the fight as the movie ends.", "Sheridan is very good on the ways and means of the IRA."], "rating": ["B-", "", "", "4/5", "3/5", "2.5/4", "B", "3/4", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Rachel Wagner", "Bob Thomas", "Serena Donadoni", "David Stratton", "Tom Hutchinson", "Matt Soergel", "Gary Thompson", "Carrie Rickey", "Roger Hurlburt", "Jay Boyar", "", "Paul Clinton (CNN.com)", "", "Richard Corliss", "Michael Wilmington", "Peter Rainer", "David Sterritt", "Joe Morgenstern", "Desson Thomson", "Stephen Hunter"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro Times (Detroit, MI)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">sbs.com.au", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Florida Times-Union", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNN.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dallas Observer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post"], "date": ["March 12, 2019", "May 14, 2013", "May 14, 2013", "May 14, 2013", "May 14, 2013", "May 14, 2013", "May 14, 2013", "May 14, 2013", "May 14, 2013", "May 14, 2013", "May 14, 2013", "May 14, 2013", "May 14, 2013", "May 14, 2013", "May 14, 2013", "May 14, 2013", "May 14, 2013", "May 14, 2013", "May 14, 2013", "May 14, 2013"]}}
