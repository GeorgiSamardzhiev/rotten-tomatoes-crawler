{"metadata": {"synopsis": "For Micky Ward (Mark Wahlberg), boxing is a family affair. His tough-as-nails mother is his manager. His half-brother, Dicky (Christian Bale), once a promising boxer himself, is his very unreliable trainer. Despite Micky's hard work, he is losing and, when the latest fight nearly kills him, he follows his girlfriend's advice and splits from the family. Then Micky becomes a contender for the world title and he -- and his family -- earns a shot at redemption.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Drama/Sports & Fitness", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "David O.

At times it can be kind of a mess, where you're not entirely sure what the real story is, but the strength of the acting carries you through the rough patches.", "A great entry into sports cinema with fantastic and honest performances. [Full review in Spanish].", "Based on a true story, The Fighter runneth over with raw energy, crazy action, and the highly seductive, brainless gallop of people dashing toward the brick wall of their own vanities and fears. It couldn't be more fun.", "Boxing fans, yes, there are plenty of wonderful boxing scenes in the movie, and for those not so interested in boxing, the movie is filled with so much more. It is full of family drama and emotional turmoil, with a touch of a love story.", "The performances from Christian Bale, Melissa Leo, and Amy Adams in The Fighter are the very definition of a masterclass in acting.", "It's pretty obvious which is more interesting.", "Russell has taken something tired and familiar and made it rich and exciting once again.", "Bale is the real star of The Fighter -- giving a career performance as a man still living off past glory.", "This is Bale's movie. The film is at its very best when the Russell's camera is trained upon his hyperactive, ego centric muse.", "The Fighter is, if not a champion film for all time, a very good, poignant, and commendable expression of its era-postindustrial working-class urban America, bereft of history as it is bereft of jobs, strong unions, pride in one's work.", "There's something powerful and real about The Fighter.", "Overall The Fighter is a touching, soulful knockout of a movie.", "The Fighter feels like it's barreling toward full-on Greek tragedy, and it has its painful patches, but ultimately-forgive me-the film pulls a lot of punches.", "But while this was amusing in a comedic or satiric context, it backfires in a dramatic narrative in which the protagonist should warrant our sympathies.", "Russell walks a narrow line between laughing with the family and laughing at them, but the film never crosses over into parody.", "Blue-collar Bostonian has replaced Southern redneck as Hollywood's white-trash signifier of choice.", "Superb performances and a well told story make The Fighter one of the year's best films.", "Driven by great performances and great characters, this drama is a must-see."], "rating": ["7/10", "3.5/4", "B+", "3/4", "", "3/4", "5/5", "3.8/5", "3/4", "A-", "3/5", "", "", "A", "", "", "B", "", "9/10", "4.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Brent McKnight", "Federico Furzan", "Felicia Feaster", "Sarah Knight Adamson", "Danielle Solzman", "David Harris", "Matthew Lucas", "Micheal Compton", "Daniel Green", "Joyce Carol Oates", "A.S.
