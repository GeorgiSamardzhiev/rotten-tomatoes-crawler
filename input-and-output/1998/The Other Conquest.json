The lack of money shows on-screen but is cleverly hidden by the director's genius for making us care about his story so much that we forgive all else.", "Caught between efforts to redress Eurocentric accounts of the conquest of Mexico and a tendency to slide into old-movie melodramatics, Carrasco's film is often gorgeous, never less than entertaining and occasionally moving.", "Carrasco delivers his message with all the grace of Corts.", "This is a film that dares to look at faith from a fresh perspective. The fact that the film is back in theaters at all is a near-miracle.", "A marvelous vision: at once spectacle, history lesson, and potent psychological drama.", "A dizzying intellectual experience that dares to tread where few films have in terms of religion, war and the curious contradictions that ensue when one group of humans conquers another.", "The drama doesn't work, and the film ends up feeling more like a history museum display.", "An impressive, beautifully visual film.", "Gran muestra de que en Mxico se puede realizar cine de alta calidad tanto en el aspecto tcnico como en el esttico y actoral"], "rating": ["4/4", "3/4", "", "", "4.5/5", "2.5/4", "2/4", "3/4", "3.5/5", "B+", "2/5", "3.5/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Eric Rosenberg", "David Elliott", "Kevin Thomas", "Ron Stringer", "Richard Nilsen", "Maitland McDonagh", "Phil Villarreal", "Larry Ratliff", "Marjorie Baumgarten", "Donald Munro", "Rich Cline", "Luisa F.
