{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this update of a 1961 film, twins Annie and Hallie (Lindsay Lohan) are strangers until happenstance unites them. The preteen girls' divorced parents, Nick (Dennis Quaid) and Elizabeth (Natasha Richardson), are living on opposite sides of the Atlantic, each with one child. After meeting at camp, American Hallie and British-raised Annie engineer an identity swap, giving both the chance to spend time with the parent they've missed. If the scheme works, it might just make the family whole again.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "2h 7m", "director": "Nancy Meyers", "studio": "WaltDisneyPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 7, 2016", "box_office": "$66.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Quite a decent facsimile of that excellent 1961 comedy of errors.", "Romance, comedy, adventure and charm come through loud and clear in this highly entertaining remake.", "", "The technology for twinning a single young actress is considerably more seamless than it was in 1961, and Lohan is a perky charmer.", "This 1998 romantic comedy mostly bores with its cumbersome exposition and close-ups of trivial objects scattered throughout lackluster montage sequences.", "The whole thing is pleasant enough -- provided you can suspend your disbelief for long enough to accept that all English people talk in plummy accents, swan around Kensington and have butlers.", "Delightful remake is great for the whole family.", "New pic is slick, sentimental and exceptionally well cast, with enough cross-generational appeal to suggest strong commercial potential.", "The light comedy is sweetly timed, the direction smart and assured, and the visuals bright, colourful, unobtrusive and faultless.", "Even if you've seen and enjoyed the original Parent Trap, this 1998 update should make you happy all over again.", "", "Agreeable remake of the 60s Disney hit.", "A light-hearted Disney remake...Lohan makes an impressive debut.", "...exactly the sort of easy-going, endlessly engaging family film that seems to have become an unusually rare breed in this day and age.", "", "Lohan is cute and charming, as would be expected, but she also brings a street-savvy quality to both her roles, and distinguishes them well enough for us to tell the difference, even if no one in the movie can.", "", "", "The Parent Trap is a nice, old-fashioned movie.", "You probably won't be missing out if you don't see this film but if you do, you'll spend a pleasant time."], "rating": ["3/5", "", "B-", "3/4", "", "3/5", "4/5", "", "", "7/10", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3.5/4", "3/4", "4/5", "2/5", "3/5", "2.5/4", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Leigh Paatsch", "Betty Jo Tucker", "Emanuel Levy", "Maitland McDonagh", "Lisa Alspector", "", "Nell Minow", "Joe Leydon", "Wally Hammond", "John J.
