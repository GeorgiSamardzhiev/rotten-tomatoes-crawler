And what could have been formula trash turns out to be fairly classy trash, after all.", "... hasn't the credentials of Dog Day Afternoon or The French Connection but this ingenious crime caper / hostage drama is one of the great New York crime films of the 1970s.", "This exceptional thriller is filled with colorful characters and crackling dialogue -- and always has one more surprise up its sleeve.", "A work of substance and an exciting experience.", "One of the decade's great defenses of New York", "Smart, tense, and funny, Joseph Sargent's thriller is a product of its times, reflecting New York in the 1970s and part of a cycle of urban paranoia movie, such as French Connection and Dog Day Afternoon.", "Surly humor powers the movie as much as the ticking-clock premise does.", "This is gritty, entertaining 1970s filmmaking at its finest.", "The original version of The Taking of Pelham One Two Three was made 35 years ago, yet it retains a quality of cool that will remain long after people have forgotten the current version.", "An archeological specimen from nearly two decades before the advent of the Metrocard", "...a quintessential 1970s New York picture, full of prickly characters and urban tension.", "", "Director Sargent piles on the tension expertly, proving that sometimes the simplest plots are the most effective.
