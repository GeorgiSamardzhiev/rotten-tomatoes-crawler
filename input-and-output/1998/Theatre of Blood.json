{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Edward Lionheart (Vincent Price) is incensed that his last season of performances in Shakespearean plays did not win him a prestigious acting award from critics. After an unsuccessful attempt at suicide, Lionheart is rescued by a group of drug-addicted bums. He then sets out to murder all of his critics, each with a different style of death taken from a Shakespeare play. When Lionheart faces head critic Peregrine Devlin (Ian Hendry), he offers Devlin a second chance to bestow the award.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Horror", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Douglas Hickox", "studio": "UnitedArtists", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 19, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Many actors would kill for the opportunity to perform Shakespeare on screen -- here, Vincent Price gets to have his soliloquy and devour it, too.", "Memorable for its lurid set-pieces (notably Robert Morley being forced to eat his own poodles), it also remains a favourite among critics; suggesting, perhaps, a certain guilty conscience. Punish us!", "For anyone who's ever wished ill on a pundit (we know you're out there), Price's merciless antics should strike a gleeful chord.", "The magnum opus of Vincent Price's film career, this stylish, witty comedy horror boasts an irresistible premise, an inspired ensemble cast, fabulous music and first-rate production values.", "Ferocious gore-satire", "One of the highlight's of Vincent Price's later career, a film that fused his reputation as a horror star with his penchant for self-parody.", "Theatre of Blood is black comedy played for chills and mood and emerges a macabre piece of wild melodramatics.", "Theater of Blood reprises the multiple-revenge theme of the Phibes films, but injects new life into the concept with a superior script and stellar cast.", "Now we don't normally take to the idea that someone should go around murdering critics, since more than one disc producer is after our own head, but the movie is always a treat when it shows up on late night television.", "Most easily described as 'deliciously nasty,' though some moments are far from delicious.", "Wholly entertaining and memorable, Theatre of Blood is ripe camp, an excellent film, and a lasting tribute to the career of one of the most important actors in the genre.", "Gory, imaginative, wildly melodramatic -- good fun.", "Superbly Vincent Price!", "You can't help but like a film with as much verve, wit and (of course) gore as this one.
