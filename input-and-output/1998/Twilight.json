{"metadata": {"synopsis": "High-school student Bella Swan (Kristen Stewart), always a bit of a misfit, doesn't expect life to change much when she moves from sunny Arizona to rainy Washington state. Then she meets Edward Cullen (Robert Pattinson), a handsome but mysterious teen whose eyes seem to peer directly into her soul. Edward is a vampire whose family does not drink blood, and Bella, far from being frightened, enters into a dangerous romance with her immortal soulmate.", "rating": "49", "genre": "Horror/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Romance", "runtime": "2h 1m", "director": "Catherine Hardwicke", "studio": "TempleHill", "theater_date": "Nov 21, 2008", "dvd_date": "Nov 21, 2015", "box_office": "$191.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The fact that it's not completely appalling is perhaps its greatest achievement.", "It's critic proof.", "For hopeful adolescents and hopeless romantics alike, this bizarrely quaint love story (adapted from the first of a best-selling series of books by Stephenie Meyer) will play the heartstrings like a harp.", "It's a recognizable coming of age story with a fiendish twist.", "Anyone who has not read the book may find themselves bewildered, or at least a little confused, without some of the nuances of the book to fill it out.", "Like most great psychological lessons in the hands of novices, this is a story far more interested in dancing to rhythms than understanding melody.", "Ten years after its release, Twilight stands as a powerful, darkly stylish depiction of teen female desire.", "Twilight is an earnest fantasy set on the cusp of adulthood, just as the way the light falls on everything in your life is changing. I don't blame anyone who wants to linger there for a moment. Even with sparkle vampires.", "The orthodox blood-drinking vampires...are about as frightening as snitty runway models, and are only there to threaten Bella's maidenly Type O so Edward can rescue her for the seven-hundredth time.", "Die-hard fans of the vampire romance novel Twilight will be happy to know that the film follows the book nearly to the letter. For everyone else, however, this isn't good news.", "In accordance with the adage about the rubbishy book making for the better movie, Twilight the film is great.", "Without descending into camp, Pattinson undercuts earnest intensity with a deft, self-conscious wit.", "The sequels became increasingly silly and overwrought but the original Twilight (2008) is actually kind of interesting even if you are not a devotee of the fan fic-turned-bestseller series.", "Stewart and Pattinson have convincing chemistry as the star-crossed lovers.", "You've been warned.", "Unless you're a 14-year-old girl who gets all giddy at the thought of cute boys and first love, steer clear of Thirteen director Catherine Hardwicke's anemic adaptation.", "Yes, it's strongly geared to the teen audience, but don't hold it against the filmmakers and go in with any preconceived notions and you'll find it a fun opening chapter of a new franchise.", "It's not the stunts and derring-do which excite the senses as much as the quiet chemistry between Stewart and Pattinson; that is guaranteed to get your blood up.", "My hope is that the sequels are actual attempts at movies. The world doesn't need any more toothless cinema.", "A deeply sincere, outright goofy vampire romance for the hot-not-to-trot abstinence set."], "rating": ["4/10", "2.5/4", "2.5/5", "", "2/4", "1.5/4", "", "2/4", "", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "0.5/5", "1/5", "6.5/10", "3/5", "C-", "2.5/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Leigh Paatsch", "Kathi Maio", "Matthew Lucas", "David Keyes", "Anne Cohen", "Bryant Frazer", "Eileen Jones", "Megan Basham", "Jenny Turner", "Brian D.
