{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A university is beset by a rash of gruesome murders that resemble old urban legends. When her friend Michelle (Natasha Gregson Wagner) is killed by someone hiding in her car, Natalie (Alicia Witt) begins to notice the pattern.

Soon the quiet college campus is transformed into hunting grounds for a maniac, and Natalie struggles to find the killer and stop the bloodshed before she becomes the next victim.", "rating": "21", "genre": "Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Jamie Blanks", "studio": "OriginalFilm,PhoenixPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 11, 2017", "box_office": "$38.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Like many unmemorable college-set slashers, the film becomes all about how the deaths might one-up each other in gruesomeness.", "It may have that '90s stank on it (obnoxious and moronic characters), but the filmmaking artistry is commendable, especially in its handling of the killing sequences.", "Thankfully Natalie is offset by Urban Legend's greatest asset and the source of the vast majority of its historical goodwill: Gayheart's balls-to-the-wall performance in the climax.", "The jokey demeanor following the ultimate reveal destroys any and all momentum.", "Urban Legend starts off very clever, then gets a little less clever the longer it goes on.", "There isn't much real wit, or suspense, in this parade of slayings.", "The concept is sound, but it's gruesomely marred in the execution.", "The makers of Urban Legend stock their film with so many one-dimensional, cookie-cutter stereotypes that its potential for exploiting deep-seated fears gets numbed.", "It's surely not the worst slasher film ever made, but it wastes the hint of creativity it promises from the outset.", "", "This is just another post-SCREAM fest desperately in need of a gimmick to distinguish [itself].", "Watchable...[but] a time-waster, with an insulting ending that unfortunately takes it down a few pegs.
