{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1956, Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers landed a doo-wop hit with \"Why Do Fools Fall in Love?\" Fame turned to tragedy as lead singer Lymon (Larenz Tate) descended into substance abuse that eventually claimed his life at age 25. But Lymon didn't just leave his fans bereft -- he also left behind three women, and each believes she's owed his song royalties: Platters singer Zola Taylor (Halle Berry), prostitute Elizabeth Waters (Vivica A. Fox) and schoolteacher Emira Eagle (Lela Rochon).", "rating": "52", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts/Romance", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Gregory Nava", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,RhinoFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 1, 2008", "box_office": "$12.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Drug use brings down teen idol; sex, violence, cursing.", "Why Do Fools Fall in Love, in its own glossy, entertaining way, is a deeper examination of how an individual can use numerous masks to conceal himself, even from the ones he loves.", "Why Do Fools Fall In Love never really conveys the essence of its subject.", "\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love\" is a misfire in several ways, but the key problem is that the writers have a clunky, concrete Christmas tree, not something thematic that can be used to devise scenes of various shades and colors.", "Too ill defined to emerge from the pack of box office also-rans.", "This biopic is soulless, underwritten, over-acted and, worse, just plain dull.", "", "Larenz Tate is terrific recreating the excitement of Frankie's stage presence.", "Worth it for the music -- but only barely.", "", "", "", "The biggest problem is the man at the center.", "A celebration of pop fantasies, a boyish rascal with a helium voice, and three pretty fools who fell in love with him.", "", "A fresh, enlightening example of how to take a tragic American show-business story and make it funny, warm and terrifically entertaining.", "Though Nava's soapy directing style makes Fools watchable enough in a campy way, the film's unsophisticated nature undermines its better qualities.", "Writer Tina Andrews' 15-year effort to bring this story of an extraordinary individual with a humpty-dumpty-life to the screen pays off big time.
