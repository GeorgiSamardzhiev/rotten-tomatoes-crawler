{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Documentary filmmaker Barbara Kopple follows Woody Allen as he tours 18 European cities with his jazz band. Indulging his first love, Allen ably plays the clarinet alongside a group of pros, as audiences revel in both the music and their proximity to the prolific director. As Allen loses his way in hotel corridors and kvetches about being unworthy of adulation, the film depicts his younger wife, Soon-Yi Previn, as the sensible household decision-maker.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Documentary/Musical & Performing Arts/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Barbara Kopple", "studio": "SweetlandFilms,JeanDoumanianProductions,CabinCreek", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$526.4K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "The subject is Woody Allen, but anyone interested in his career as a writer, stand-up comedian, actor or filmmaker will learn little from Barbara Kopple's new documentary.", "Kopple's discreet, quietly revelatory style creates a fine balance between public and private personae that veers more pointedly toward the personal in an incongruous but fascinating coda.", "There's only one certain conclusion: Woody Allen finds it terrifically uncomfortable being Woody Allen.", "It provides some generous insights into his psychic background when his unsupportive parents greet him back in New York at the end.", "It's hardly a revelation, but Allen emerges as genuinely neurotic. He's also funny.", "Not quite the type of political punchiness one would expect from Kopple, but it does answer a lot of questions about Allen who obviously had a strong hand in the film's compilation.", "", "", "", "", "Craftsmanship and wit are as present here as in [director Barbara Kopple's] more socially-minded, dramatic work.", "Wonderful documentary, a rare look at the real Woody.", "An interesting documentary covering a tour of Woody Allen's New Orleans Jazz band. If you enjoy the music, or are a fan of all things Woody, then you should give this one a rental. Others probably wouldn't enjoy it.", "", "This is a very fine film, especially for film buffs and fans of Woody Allen.", "[Kopple's] made a greatly enjoyable film, but you can't help wondering if she's fallen under her subject's spell.", "If you'd like to see what 90 minutes of Woody's neurotic home life is like, punctuated by some clarinet blowing, this is the movie for you.", "Whatever one thinks about Woody Allen, you'll probably find it in here, except why Americans don't much turn out to see his movies.", "Thoroughly fascinating and is must-see viewing for any Woody Allen fan. Barbara Kopple, on the other hand, should get back to pointing her lens at more significant social phenomena."], "rating": ["4/5", "2.5/4", "", "", "", "", "3.5/5", "3/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "B+", "4/5", "2/5", "3/4", "8/10", "3/4", "3/5", "", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Cole Smithey", "Maitland McDonagh", "David Rooney", "Film4 Staff", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "", "Tom Meek", "Emanuel Levy", "Daniel M.
