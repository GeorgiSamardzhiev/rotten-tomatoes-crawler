{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When teen debutante Kelly (Denise Richards) fails to attract the attention of her hunky guidance counselor, Sam (Matt Dillon), she cries rape, igniting a scandal that results in his arrest. Sam appeals to Ken (Bill Murray), a hack personal-injury lawyer who has never handled a case that couldn't be helped by a prop neck brace. Soon, a second victim, Suzie (Neve Campbell), comes forward, and Detective Duquette (Kevin Bacon) discovers that the unfolding case is far from what it seems.", "rating": "62", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "John McNaughton", "studio": "MandalayPictures", "theater_date": "Mar 20, 1998", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$29.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's difficult to dismiss the notoriety - and silliness - of the much-talked-about threesome scene (short and incomplete as it may be), which overshadows the plot.", "Absolutely ridiculous.
