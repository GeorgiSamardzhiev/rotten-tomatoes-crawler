{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Before Steve Prefontaine (Billy Crudup) makes it to the 1972 Olympics in Munich, he is an unlikely track star at the University of Oregon. At school, after Steve initially clashes with coach Bill Bowerman (Donald Sutherland) over his style of front-running -- running the race at maximum speed from beginning to end -- he develops a strong bond with the man. Steve also has a profound effect on a beautiful co-ed named Mary (Monica Potter), who becomes the object of his affection.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Documentary/Drama", "runtime": "1h 57m", "director": "Robert Towne", "studio": "Cruise-WagnerProductions", "theater_date": "Sep 11, 1998", "dvd_date": "Oct 24, 2008", "box_office": "$777.4K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Dazzling, violent, star-driven thrill rides are routine.
