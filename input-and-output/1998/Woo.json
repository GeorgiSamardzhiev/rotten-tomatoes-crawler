{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Woo (Jada Pinkett Smith) is a woman in control of her world. She is smart, self-confident, sophisticated and snarky. And she doesn't have any trouble attracting members of the opposite sex. But for some reason no one ever sticks around. Woo meets Tim (Tommy Davidson), a paralegal who is her complete opposite. They shouldn't click. However, Woo and Tim begin to bond when a series of weird and stressful calamities hits them while they are on their first date.", "rating": "10", "genre": "Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 24m", "director": "Daisy von Scherler Mayer", "studio": "NewDealProductions,GothamEntertainmentGroup", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 21, 2016", "box_office": "$8.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Pinkett Smith, who was so good in her supporting role in The Nutty Professor, is here little more than a mannequin for skimpy clothes.", "A romantic comedy that strains for the screwball heights of Bringing Up Baby but mainly seems unfunny and unpleasant.", "Woo disappoints on so many levels, lacking in wit and intelligence, characters with any sense of dimension and a coherent story line.", "A painfully graceless comedy that reworks After Midnight, Blind Date and Booty Call into something monstrous and untoward.", "Pinkett Smith does just fine. She's sexy, funny and ironic and carries Woo as it ambles all over a Brooklyn night that's one long party.", "The whole thing is rude and pathetic, more like a lengthy episode of a bad sitcom than a movie, chock full of the kind of sexual innuendoes that are guaranteed to please horny eighth-graders or people who laugh at those Playboy party jokes.", "It would all be easier to take if the title character were presented with an ounce of charm. Woo is much too selfish, insensitive and narcissistic for audiences to want to buy her, and Smith is still much too self-conscious an actress to sell her.", "[A] truly awful disaster.", "Initially, Woo seems every bit the fun dating film that's guaranteed to give urban 20-somethings their six bucks of fulfillment. Unsurprisingly, it's no more than that, although at times its tenuous jokes add up to a bit less.", "A romantic comedy, it's such a sloppy mess that polishing it with all the Pledge in the world couldn't help brighten it up.", "Woo is proof that you can take a tired retread of a plot -- a blind date from hell -- and infuse it with just the right amount of freshness, style and vivacity to make it new again.", "As the film plods on, Woo's initial, slightly mysterious charm wilts from overexposure; the frantic antics fall flat and the whole contrived mess begins to feel increasingly obvious and boring.", "This Manhattan-based romantic comedy might be fun if it didn't hit you over the head with a sledgehammer every few minutes.", "A graceless and gratingly unfunny comedy that brings out the worst in just about everybody involved.", "Equally unengaging are hero Tim (Davidson), the wimpish buppie who loves her, and his male buddies, who provide the requisite quota of chauvinism.", "", "", "Thank goodness Jada Pinkett Smith and Tommy Davidson are so much fun to watch. Without them, Woo would be another half-baked comedy bound for the oblivion bin.", "", "What characterization there is consists of weak, stupid men empowered by dominant, predatory women, encased in witless, tasteless commercial rubbish."], "rating": ["0.5/4", "1/4", "1.5/4", "", "", "", "1.5/4", "1/5", "2.5/5", "", "", "2/4", "", "", "", "2/5", "2/5", "2.5/4", "2/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Monica Eng", "Dave Kehr", "Melanie McFarland", "John Anderson", "Matt Soergel", "Paul Tatara", "Ann Hornaday", "Jo Berry", "Forrest Green III", "Leah Rozen", "Laura Kelly", "Sandra Contreras", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Joe Leydon", "Charlotte O&#39;Sullivan", "Emanuel Levy", "Daniel M.
