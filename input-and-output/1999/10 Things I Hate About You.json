{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Kat Stratford (Julia Stiles) is beautiful, smart and quite abrasive to most of her fellow teens, meaning that she doesn't attract many boys. Unfortunately for her younger sister, Bianca (Larisa Oleynik), house rules say that she can't date until Kat has a boyfriend, so strings are pulled to set the dour damsel up for a romance. Soon Kat crosses paths with handsome new arrival Patrick Verona (Heath Ledger). Will Kat let her guard down enough to fall for the effortlessly charming Patrick?", "rating": "69", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Gil Junger", "studio": "TouchstonePictures,MadChance", "theater_date": "Mar 31, 1999", "dvd_date": "Oct 2, 2014", "box_office": "$38.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The script is funny and mostly charming. Really the whole thing is a fractal: I had every reason to hate this movie, and yet I found myself loving it against my will...", "The humor doesn't always work for me but it is extremely well cast with a clever concept", "10 Things I Hate About You is a sweet romantic comedy. But it is also a treatise about how young people navigate, negotiate, and balance all of the social, cultural, and personal expectations that swarm around them from all sides.", "[Stiles] is quite successful in the role and well-matched with Ledger.", "10 Things I Hate About You captures a moment of teen drama, fear, and exploration in a perfect time capsule.", "Solid performances from an ensemble cast make 10 Things I Hate About You a solid teen comedy classic.", "It's absolutely magical, much like Heath Ledger's face.", "Quirky, inventive, and brimming over with clever visual gags and colorful supporting characters, 10 Things uses Shakespeare as a jumping-off point to playfully send up a society that doesn't know what to do with a strong woman.", "A movie that looks outward, that leads you elsewhere, out of the self, toward literature and life.", "A witty reworking of Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew in the form of a modern-day screwball teen comedy, Gil Junger's 10 Things I Hate about You actually owes very little to the original beyond basic plot points and a handful of names.", "10 Things is smarter than most adolescent fluff, but it never cuts loose with the unexpected daft zing of Clueless or transcends its pre-cap-and-gown concerns.", "It's a fun movie, and I will consider Patrick Verona my first movie love until the day I die. I miss Heath Ledger.", "10 Things I Hate About You can and should be viewed as the ultimate teen movie, bursting through the hellish decade to say a little more about the empowering potential of those defining years.", "10 Things is a bright little romantic comedy, nicely and sharply written, which wears its learning winningly and lightly.", "With the finest source material around given a modern zing, this teen comedy is somehow tried and true, but fresh all at the same time.", "Junger spins hilariously written scenes with split-second timing, although the story sags during its long middle portion.", "Smartly paced, fun and funny, this is just as enjoyable for adults as it is for its intended teenage market.", "One of the delightful things about this film is its detail. Each non- speaking character has a purpose, whether explored through their dress or the roll of an eye.", "One of the absolute best teen-driven romantic comedies.", "Steeped in a smartness and sincerity becoming of its Shakespearean roots."], "rating": ["", "", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "2.5/4", "4/5", "", "7/10", "B+"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Eve Tushnet", "Rachel Wagner", "Sez\u00edn Koehler", "David Hunter", "Joelle Monique", "Danielle Solzman", "Andrew Gruttadaro", "Scott Tobias", "Stephen Hunter", "Stephen Dalton", "Leah Rozen", "Genevieve Burgess", "Caitlin Quinlan", "Peter Bradshaw", "Caroline Westbrook", "David Sterritt", "Jo Berry", "Antonia Quirke", "Tim Brayton", "Rob Humanick"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patheos", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rachel&#39;s Reviews (YouTube)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Black Girl Nerds", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Pajiba", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Solzy at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Ringer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Pajiba", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Little White Lies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent on Sunday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Projection Booth"], "date": ["August 14, 2020", "June 10, 2020", "May 24, 2020", "April 8, 2019", "April 2, 2019", "April 1, 2019", "March 26, 2019", "January 28, 2019", "January 28, 2019", "January 28, 2019", "January 28, 2019", "January 28, 2019", "January 28, 2019", "January 28, 2019", "January 28, 2019", "January 28, 2019", "January 28, 2019", "November 28, 2017", "November 27, 2014", "January 15, 2012"]}}
