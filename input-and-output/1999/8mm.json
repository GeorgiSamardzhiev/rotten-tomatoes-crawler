[Full review in Spanish].", "By the end, the overwrought dialogue provokes unintended laughs, and even Cage -- aided by memorable work from Phoenix, Peter Stormare and James Gandolfini -- can't save it.", "Mr. Cage has become such a wet-eyed purveyor of moral anguish that he makes Mr. Pitt look calm, cool and collected.", "8MM is technically proficient and strongly acted, but when it comes to staking out any moral or intellectual claims, it clearly isn't up to snuff.", "It deals with subject matter that holds your attention, even if it never frays your nerves as much as it could have.", "Poorly developed, 8mm is anything but a pretty picture.", "I can't say I warmed to the results, but I was solidly held for the film's two hours.", "A movie that keeps jumping the gate and finally unravels all over the floor.", "Sets a new record for gross stupidity.", "Director Joel Schumacher aims for a psychological depth that the script can't sustain.", "There's no faulting Cage's committed, intense performance, but his slide from professional, internalised concern into personal, self-righteous rage still leaves a nasty aftertaste.", "Walker at least has a solid premise here. Too bad the script didn't find its way to another David Fincher who could understand it.", "Want to know what happens when an A-list director and A-list movie star attach themselves to a direct-to-cable screenplay?
