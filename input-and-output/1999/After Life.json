{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this acclaimed Japanese film, a group of people who have recently died find themselves in a limbo realm resembling a relatively mundane building. Counselors, including Takashi (Arata) and Shiori (Erika Oda), are on hand to help new arrivals pick one memory from their lives to bring with them into eternity. Once the memories are chosen, the staff makes a short film representing each one, and the films make up a collage of thoughtful cinematic moments.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 58m", "director": "Hirokazu Koreeda", "studio": "EngineFilmInc.,TVManUnion", "theater_date": "May 12, 1998", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$802.0K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A quiet and contemplative meditation on the importance of memory and the meaning of death.", "It is, quite simply, a stunning and meta-cinematically deft ode to the enduring properties of memories and sensations.", "A wild daydream about what might happen to human souls after they die... mostly interested in the most basic, everyday kind of thoughts and feelings.", "To its own amateur band, this film's whimsical dance of death zeroes in on what is wonderful in life and the people who live it and, in death, stay on in memory.", "The film's strength lies in the way these interviews inevitably trigger our own thoughts on the matter.", "An affecting and unpredictable film that lingers on one's mind long after viewing.", "", "How people remember, how they fictionalize their memories, and the nature of memory itself are all part of the fascination of After Life.", "", "When his instincts are just right Kore-eda has both the perfect technique and the perfect touch for suggesting (without explicitly defining) the immanence of human experience.", "With its meditative, humanistic tone, After Life is the cinematic reminiscence of limbo itself, this transitional space of contemplation and nostalgia.", "This is a very special movie, unlike anything I've seen in a long time.", "", "", "A true oxymoron, at once endlessly fascinating and terminally dull.", "", "A potentially intriguing concept undone by flawed execution.", "", "", "meaningful, but sleepy."], "rating": ["", "5/5", "4.5/5", "", "4.5/5", "B", "B+", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "2/5", "7/10", "3/5", "", "1.5/4", "B-", "7/10", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Rob Aldam", "PJ Nabarro", "Tim Brayton", "Donald J.
