While visiting her exotic palace, Aladdin stumbles upon a magic oil lamp that unleashes a powerful, wisecracking, larger-than-life genie.

The songs frequently interrupt the flow of the story, creating a stop-and-go feel that sucks some of the film's momentum away.", "When the sand settles, Aladdin is more fun than needs fixing.", "The movie addresses the problematic aspects of the original to make it more modern and relatable.", "A fully computer-animated Abu is the first of many changes that furnish a hint of phoniness in a world that now demands a greater suspension of disbelief.", "Visually, this is a stunning feat along with incredible action stunts and choreography.", "Aladdin is much like its protagonist; flawed, a little clumsy, but ultimately quite winning; a diamond in the rough.", "It is nonsense that tests my patience quota for two eternally boring hours. [Full review in Spanish]", "A nostalgic magic carpet ride that might not be \"a whole new world\" of original filmmaking, but is a welcome familiar world after the depressing downer \"Dumbo\" (2019).", "Ritchie leaves behind his trademark slow downed style of editing in favour of some questionable speeded up dance sequences which look cheap and badly edited in the flamboyancy of imagination clearly taken from Bollywood.", "The production was so focused on making us remember the past that it did little to make the present memorable.", "This is one film that we would watch for the sake of it but come out of the theatre wishing for the good ol' days.", "Sure, it's almost exactly like the animated version, but they gave Jasmine the feminist edge that was sorely lacking in the cartoon.", "This live-action version of the Disney animated classic does a very good job capturing most of what made the original magical ... while expanding on the story and the characters.", "Will Smith puts a fun spin on proceedings. He brings his \"A\" game, which we haven't seen in some of his recent outings.", "Aladdin shows superior technical craftsmanship in so many aspects of the film, but its failure to reckon with a change of medium, bungling of story, and underwhelming characters, means that it is ultimately unsatisfying.", "An unimaginative remake that can be entertaining but feels empty and forgettable.", "There's enough here to make the film stand out on its own. Whether it stands out for the right reasons is up to the viewer.", "An unsubtle, fast-moving film with plenty of jokes and a visual style that would suit a themed Las Vegas hotel, it's certainly not an all-time Disney great, but I can see it being a half-term hit.", "The design is gawdy without the joy of camp.
