{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Bobby (Christian Bale) is a mentally handicapped young man with an affinity for animals. He runs away from home after his stepfather (Daniel Benzali) kills all his pets. While on the road, he meets a peculiar old man who calls himself Mr. Summers (John Hurt), who buries the dead animals he finds on the side of the road. The two outcasts form a bond over their love of animals, but Bobby knows that eventually he'll have to return home and confront his stepfather.", "rating": "65", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 52m", "director": "Jeremy Thomas", "studio": "IsleofManFilm,RecordedPicturesCompany,J&amp;MEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$23.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Bale, with his embarrassed lisp and straight, slim back, is perfectly curious, perfectly amazed, perfectly different. His performance is quite beautiful, and whenever he is on screen, the film is melancholy and innocent.", "", "Based on a 1969 novel by the late Walker Hamilton, this moody film is ravishingly beautiful to look at and refreshingly unlike the glib, movie-centric crime thrillers so popular with younger first-time directors.", "Given his uncompromising work with the likes of Roeg, Bertolucci and Cronenberg, Thomas' directorial debut is surprisingly bland.", "Bale nimbly walks a fine line between Bobby's handicap and an increasingly mature comprehension of what he must do to survive.", "", "A brave effort, certainly different, but all too emphatically an allegory.", "Christian Bale is utterly sympathetic and engaging as Bobby. He convincingly communicates both the simplicity and chaos of his character's personality and gives the film a strong emotional core.", "", "Odd and banal.", "Click to read the article.", "", "", "It moves from a Cinderella fairytale with Rain Man pathos to the good-versus-evil realm of daytime soap operas (minus the sexual content).", "The ingredients all seem to be there for a rich, emotionally engrossing movie experience, but the storytelling flair and directorial touch are not.", "Interesting despite its hipster crypticism and an imperfect finale. Is Christian Bale in every film Lions Gate has made?", "Would seem hokey if it didn't have powerful, extraordinary central performances and cinematography that lends the English landscape around Cornwall a mythical cast.", "The screenplay is so lacking in narrative sensibilities, it's difficult to enumerate all its failings.", "Quite the off-kilter, half-baked eco-sermon to begin with, Thomas's movie crumbles in its last quarter or so like a stack of supermarket cans.", "If you can allow for one irrational and unbelievable scene involving Bobby and Summers' trip to London, you're left with a decent, small- scale movie, perhaps more suitable for video than the large screen."], "rating": ["", "B-", "2.5/4", "", "", "4/5", "", "3/5", "3/5", "", "", "3/5", "2/5", "1.5/5", "", "3.5/5", "3/5", "", "", "8/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Antonia Quirke", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Maitland McDonagh", "", "Todd McCarthy", "Cole Smithey", "Geoff Andrew", "Ilana Lindsey", "Emanuel Levy", "Jeff Millar", "Staci Layne Wilson", "Michael Szymanski", "David Poland", "Susan Green", "William Arnold", "Christopher Null", "Stephen Holden", "Maria Garcia", "Michael Atkinson", "Harvey S.
