{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Lester Burnham (Kevin Spacey) is a gainfully employed suburban husband and father. Fed up with his boring, stagnant existence, he quits his job and decides to reinvent himself as a pot-smoking, responsibility-shirking teenager.

Mendes infuses the lush visuals and lyrical script with dramatic panache.", "The writing is acidically amusing without ever trying to conceal the loneliness at the heart, the direction a perfect frame for the characters and the wonderful performances that create them.", "Kevin Spacey is the greatest actor of his generation, hands down, no contest.", "The film is stunningly poignant, and when first time cinema director Mendes turns his hands to the serious aspects of the disintegration of human souls, the funny lurches to the profound with hardly a flicker of disruption.", "Mendes loves his performers, framing their big moments with suburban metaphors and dizzily poetic fantasies.", "With its parade of neurotics, psychotics, bigots and deceivers, American Beauty is an endlessly rewatchable black comedy.", "A truly beautiful, poignant and brilliantly funny film, it doesn't get much better than this."], "rating": ["1", "", "1/4", "A+", "", "4/4", "3/5", "", "4/5", "", "4/4", "", "", "", "4.5/5", "4/4", "5/5", "A+", "5/5", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Tim Stevens", "Josh Larsen", "Tim Dirks", "Steven Hyden", "Dennis King", "PJ Nabarro", "Andy Spletzer", "Israel Paredes", "Paul Clinton (CNN.com)", "Ann Hornaday", "Jeff Strickler", "Bill Gallo", "Ed Potton", "Margaret Pomeranz", "Scott Nash", "Natalie Stone", "Steve Persall", "Marc Lee", "Megan Spencer"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spool", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmsite", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Uproxx", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Stranger (Seattle, WA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sensacine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNN.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Minneapolis Star Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">sbs.com.au", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Three Movie Buffs", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sky Cinema", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tampa Bay Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Triple J"], "date": ["September 9, 2020", "December 19, 2019", "October 16, 2019", "September 27, 2019", "September 16, 2019", "February 21, 2019", "December 2, 2018", "March 2, 2018", "February 27, 2018", "February 22, 2015", "February 22, 2015", "February 22, 2015", "February 22, 2015", "February 22, 2015", "February 22, 2015", "February 22, 2015", "February 22, 2015", "February 22, 2015", "February 22, 2015", "February 22, 2015"]}}
