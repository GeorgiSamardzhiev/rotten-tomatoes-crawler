{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A riotous and raunchy exploration of the most eagerly anticipated -- and most humiliating -- rite of adulthood, known as losing one's virginity. In this hilarious lesson in life, love and libido, a group of friends, fed up with their well-deserved reputations as sexual no-hitters, decide to take action.", "rating": "61", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Paul Weitz", "studio": "SummitEntertainment,UniversalPictures,NewmarketCapitalGroup,Zide-PerryProductions", "theater_date": "Jul 9, 1999", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2015", "box_office": "$101.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The tight writing and direction underpinning this very likeable ensemble chuckler nails every tacky joke and surreal sight gag with considerable aplomb.", "Seann William Scott's great boorish creation, Stifler, provides nice flashes of idiosyncrasy away from the more stereotypical characterisations of the four main friends.", "American Pie has a likable cast, but the actors appear throttled back by a pedestrian script and direction. Consequently, one winds up liking the film more than it deserves because of the gameness of its attractive cast.", "What makes American Pie stand out is its extreme commitment to the bit, its relentlessly sex-positive attitude, and its sneaky ability to be both disgusting and kind of sweet.", "There are some fine comedic moments that still shine, despite \"American Pie\" being pretty forgettable...", "Although it has many familiar elements, this fresh slice of American adolescence isn't baked from the same warmed-over stereotypes and formulaic storylines of the recent batch of teen movies.", "It works as well as it does because the central cast - equal parts male and female, lest we forget - are all so uniformly endearing.", "It may not have invented the genre, but it did bring that genre to a whole new generation.", "A well aimed jab at jock culture full of satisyingly dirty belly laughs.", "Another giggly gross-out comedy for teenagers, this one somewhat better than most by virtue of a more satisfying ending.", "Ultra-raunchy sex comedy is a teen fave -- beware.", "Rest of the rancid jokes, listless performances, and mild sauce mischief bury the basic boner novelty of American Pie alive. Eleven years later, it's still the same insufferable, meaningless hooey it always was.", "American Pie shows us how little boys know about sex going into it, and how little the act really teaches them about it as well. But the true joy, for us in the audience anyway, is the chase. Vulgar and heartwarming!", "The production is amateurish and cheap-looking, but two decent performances are worth mentioning: Chris Klein as a sensitive jock and Alyson Hannigan as a nerdy flute player.", "It has likable characters and infectiously funny situations, and that's about all a comedy like this needs.", "A surprisingly large amount of screen time devoted to the sickly sweet morality tales of the movie which would be fine on TV series...but are way too frothy and take up too much time here.", "A crude piece of work, spottily acted and directed.", "More likely to gross out adults than kids.", "", "More mature audiences, beware, 'cause this ain't your film."], "rating": ["3/5", "3/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "4/5", "", "", "3/5", "D", "4.5/5", "1/5", "4/5", "2.5/4", "", "", "2/4", "C+"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Leigh Paatsch", "PJ Nabarro", "Kirk Honeycutt", "Andrew Gruttadaro", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Serena Donadoni", "Charlie Lyne", "Kevin Carr", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Heather Boerner", "Brian Orndorf", "Karina Montgomery", "Jim Lane", "Rob Gonsalves", "Garth Franklin", "Geoff Andrew", "", "James Verniere", "Robin Clifford"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Ringer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Cinema Girl", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Ultra Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">7M Pictures", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">BrianOrndorf.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinerina", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sacramento News &amp; Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dark Horizons", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Houston Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Herald", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reeling Reviews"], "date": ["June 4, 2020", "August 21, 2019", "July 9, 2019", "March 26, 2019", "January 14, 2017", "October 26, 2012", "April 29, 2012", "April 18, 2012", "November 8, 2011", "November 8, 2011", "December 18, 2010", "April 19, 2010", "December 15, 2009", "August 7, 2008", "July 23, 2007", "December 30, 2006", "June 24, 2006", "July 21, 2005", "July 16, 2005", "April 9, 2005"]}}
