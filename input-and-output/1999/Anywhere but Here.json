{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this adaptation of the Mona Simpson novel, single mother Adele August (Susan Sarandon) is bad with money, and even worse when it comes to making decisions. Her straight-laced daughter, Ann (Natalie Portman), is a successful high school student with Ivy League aspirations. When Adele decides to pack up and move the two of them from the Midwest to Beverly Hills, Calif., to pursue her dreams of Hollywood success, Ann grows frustrated with her mother's irresponsible and impulsive ways.", "rating": "64", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "Wayne Wang", "studio": "Fox2000Pictures,20thCenturyFox", "theater_date": "Oct 12, 1999", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$18.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "Solid story of independence for teens.", "Portman is excellent, balancing wisdom and petulance, loyalty and imposition...", "As a depiction of a loving-turbulent relationship between a single mom (Susan Sarandon) and her rebellious teenage daughter (Natalie Portman), Wang's meller is nicely crafted but old-fashioned like Hollywood's weepies of yesteryear.", "Director Wayne Wang has delivered a solid entertainment, particularly for women, with Anywhere But Here.", "Adele and Ann are not easy screen characters to like, but they are easy to believe in -- especially in the skins of Sarandon and Portman.", "A subtle and unexpected pleasure, all nuanced performance and character detail.", "", "Natalie Portman is my new hero.", "The title might very well be an appropriate description of what more impatient filmgoers may be feeling after sitting through this frustratingly mediocre dramedy.", "In its eagerness to give voice to the overshadowed daughter, the film never allows the mother to live.", "The movie drops in on a crucial part of their lives, follows it for a few minutes and then jettisons to another episode. It's like watching 10 short stories.", "Inspired pairing of Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman as an outrageous mother and her more practical daughter.", "The movie doesn't feel authentic, it's relationships are drawn in erratic, TV movie-like strokes.", "Wang keeps a precise balance, necessary to blend a high-octane performance from Sarandon with an understated one from Portman.", "The delicate, devastating pas de deux between Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman demonstrates that great actresses are still available, even if Hollywood doesn't want to use them.", "Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman put on an acting clinic that's a treat to watch, but, no matter how accomplished, a clinic is not a movie. They do a lot with a little, yet it's far from enough.", "A heartfelt drama about a mother and daughter having trouble connecting.", "Without a strong central narrative ... the film loses momentum and ends as one more tired treatise on family dysfunction.", "This is a mother/daughter film.
