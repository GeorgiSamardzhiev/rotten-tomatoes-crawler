{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this quirky cult-favorite comedy, unemployed New York City puppeteer Craig Schwartz (John Cusack) reluctantly takes a temp job as a filing clerk for the eccentric Dr. Lester (Orson Bean). While at work, Craig discovers a portal that leads into the mind of renowned actor John Malkovich. When he lets his attractive co-worker Maxine (Catherine Keener) in on the secret, they begin both an unusual business scheme and an odd relationship that involves Craig's restless wife, Lotte (Cameron Diaz).", "rating": "93", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 52m", "director": "Spike Jonze", "studio": "GramercyPictures,SingleCellPictures,PropagandaFilms", "theater_date": "Oct 29, 1999", "dvd_date": "Jun 15, 2012", "box_office": "$22.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The very meta tale stars and is about thespian and sometime Cambridge resident John Malkovich and the puppeteer (John Cusack) who discovers a portal into his brain.", "The intense invention and creativity at work in this extraordinary movie is overwhelming.", "Kaufman and Jonze steer us through a truly twisted psychological and existential swamp.", "Outlandish, hilarious and exceedingly clever.", "For two hours, it works like the best music videos: making high-concept philosophies graspable, marvelous and fun.", "What could have developed into a one-gag film becomes a gender-bending extravaganza with a crazy network of love triangles... The real magic of Being John Malkovich is that it never fails to surprise.", "Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman's hallucinatory meditation on human embodiment, celebrity, and, uh, John Malkovich remains the ultimate marriage of '90s music-video aesthetics and absurdist narrative storytelling.", "Accept that even Jonze and Kaufman will most likely never provide a worthy substitute to Being John Malkovich themselves. It's awfully hard, even 20 years later, to find a movie even half as bizarre that was also even half as successful.", "Fabulously funny and delightfully disturbed, \"Being John Malkovich'' is the ultimate voyeur movie, a dark and at times malevolent take on what it's like to be in someone else's skull, looking out.", "The beauty of the film is the way it elevates John Malkovich from an actor to an axiom.", "It's a film, indeed, of such jaw-dropping originality that its flaws -- and it definitely has some -- count for far less than they otherwise would.", "Though Being John Malkovich was deliciously original and delivers an underrated performance by John Cusack, the ending was a bit disappointing.", "There's something fantastically proto-Internet about this romantic-dramedy of flop-sweat desperation, role-playing, simulation and eccentric, niche-culture behaviour-a world of virtual-reality escapes, alter egos, sexual fetishes and rabbit-hole trips.", "an essential existentialist text.", "An incredibly rich and entertaining (not to say, laudably malevolent) film that far transcends its already way-out title premise ...", "Playing by its own rules every step of the way, Being John Malkovich is clearly the sort of movie that needs to be made more often.", "", "[VIDEO ESSAY] Corollaries of desire break through dead-end walls only to be reinvented on the other side in a supernatural spectrum of practical existence.
