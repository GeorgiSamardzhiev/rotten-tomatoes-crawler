{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Adam Webber (Brendan Fraser) has lived his entire life in confinement in a fallout shelter in Pasadena, Calif. When the Webber family's rations of food and supplies grow thin, Adam's eccentric father, Calvin (Christopher Walken), sends him on a dangerous restocking mission. When Adam emerges from the Webber family's subterranean refuge for the first time, he finds that rumors of a nuclear apocalypse were totally false -- and meets gorgeous Eve Rustikov (Alicia Silverstone).", "rating": "58", "genre": "Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Hugh Wilson", "studio": "NewLineCinema", "theater_date": "Feb 12, 1999", "dvd_date": "Jan 23, 2009", "box_office": "$26.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...an irresistible premise that's generally employed to entertaining (if somewhat erratic) effect...", "Blast is finally a squandered opportunity, a lot of situation with very little comedy.", "Blast From the Past saves its best for first.", "Fraser is the sweet, goofy engine that drives this movie. The script doesn't do enough with his reactions to a world that bears little relation to the Cold War planet Adam has been told about, but Fraser still manages to suggest volumes.", "Garish and not funny enough, Wilson's shapeless satire plods on, squandering its nice premise and its appealing actors. Miraculously, Fraser has a force field around him and manages to radiate energy in this comic black hole.", "Thanks to a clever script, tight direction, a first-rate cast and the dynamite combination of Brendan Fraser and Alicia Silverstone, Blast from the Past blows away the recent crop of romantic comedies.", "That's a relatively clever set-up for what's become a familiar genre: the time-displacement comedy, in which we get a kick out of viewing our era through another era's eyes. But this movie's eyes, Adam's, are awfully twinkly and not too focused.", "Despite its faintly mechanical construction, Blast From The Past is very classy, and the improbable comic duo of Spacek and Walken provide the manic edge. Silverstone is good, engagingly grouchy but Fraser is indeed a blast.", "Unfortunately Mr. Fraser comes off as a forlorn, outsize Pee Wee Herman.", "The 40-minute setup is deliciously nutty, with eccentric turns from Walken and Spacek. But the longer Adam remains above ground, the more plodding and predictable the scenario becomes.", "[A] bizarre hybrid of romantic comedy cliches and less-than-subtle social commentary.", "Despite its original concept, the movie loses much of its socially satiric edge once Fraser emerges from his underground bunker and starts wooing Silverstone.", "Blast From the Past doesn't overtax Fraser's abilities -- the film is only a sweet comic confection -- but director and co-writer Hugh Wilson does rely on a rare quality that Fraser has in spades: charm.", "A stretched-out anecdote.", "Once the movie decides the air is clear and Fraser begins walking the earth, Blast becomes much spottier at hitting its comic targets and suffers from a bad case of the cutes.", "Any movie with a rhyming title should be treated with suspicion. And Blast From The Past -- two films inconveniently rolled into one creaking rom-com -- is as bad as it gets.", "Blast From the Past has a sweet, joyful spirit and some fun performances.", "There's something a little bit creepy and Dole-like about the notion that 35 years ago, everything was good and pure and right (except for that whole Cold War mess), while today, everything has become debased and confusing.", "This fresh idea delivers some scintillating humor.", "It's pleasant enough, with Fraser's goofy charm particularly winning."], "rating": ["3/4", "2.5/4", "", "2.5/4", "2/4", "", "1.5/4", "", "", "", "2/4", "2.5/4", "", "", "", "2/5", "", "", "3/4", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Nusair", "Jack Mathews", "Desson Thomson", "John Hartl", "Carrie Rickey", "Jonathan Foreman", "Mark Caro", "Jonathan Romney", "Joe Morgenstern", "Rita Kempley", "Maitland McDonagh", "Robert Dominguez", "Peter Travers", "Lisa Alspector", "Leah Rozen", "Yael Shuv", "Jay Boyar", "Keith Phipps", "Laura Danese", "Alan Jones"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rolling Stone", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times"], "date": ["June 7, 2020", "January 3, 2018", "March 21, 2014", "March 21, 2014", "March 21, 2014", "March 21, 2014", "March 21, 2014", "March 21, 2014", "March 21, 2014", "March 21, 2014", "March 21, 2014", "March 21, 2014", "March 21, 2014", "March 21, 2014", "March 21, 2014", "March 21, 2014", "March 21, 2014", "March 21, 2014", "March 21, 2014", "March 21, 2014"]}}
