{"metadata": {"synopsis": "On the verge of bankruptcy and desperate for his big break, aspiring filmmaker Bobby Bowfinger (Steve Martin) concocts a crazy plan to make his ultimate dream movie. Rallying a ragtag team that includes a starry-eyed ingenue (Heather Graham), a has-been diva (Christine Baranski) and a film studio gofer (Jamie Kennedy), he sets out to shoot a blockbuster featuring the biggest star in Hollywood, Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) -- only without letting Ramsey know he's in the picture.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Frank Oz", "studio": "ImagineEntertainment,UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "Aug 13, 1999", "dvd_date": "Jan 26, 2016", "box_office": "$66.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The minor characters are also great - most notably, Heather Graham..., Christine Baranski as a deluded stage veteran, and Eddie Murphy again in a second, surprise role that caps off the mayhem with just the right dash of stupidity.", "Directed by Frank Oz and written by Steve Martin...", "Bowfinger (1999), Steve Martin's tribute to shoestring filmmaking and big-screen dreams, is a loving lampoon that gamely straddles the chasm between cynical con-artistry and benign innocence.", "Entertaining, great actors but not a home run.", "The best thing about Bowfinger is the way the script by Steve Martin is tooled to his own and Murphy's comic strengths.", "Hugely funny film that mixes knowing satire with winning stupidity, and has Martin and Murphy in form they have rarely managed in recent years.", "This is enjoyable but thin, which is no doubt what was intended.", "A showcase for wit.", "Mr. Murphy chews the scenery every chance he gets and it recalls what made him such a star in the first place.", "Murphy is wonderful ... The plot is mechanical, clunky and boring.", "Preposterous and utterly self-absorbed, this has la-la land down to a tee.", "Just watch two of the still funniest guys in the country do what they do best, without a bad script to get in the way.", "You'll laugh 'til you stop!", "This all has the potential to become a sidesplitting caper. ... Unfortunately, only a few of the manic scenes work.", "[An] entertaining little comedy that should be forgiven for not living to its potential.", "It's lively and frequently funny -- but why does it leave such a sour aftertaste?", "Lest the movie get too saccharine (and it never does), Eddie Murphy is on hand to juice things up.", "Hilarious.", "The movie reaches giddy, cartoonish heights, even while it carefully dodges any chance to move beyond skin-deep.", "A wicked satire of the absurdity of the Los Angeles lifestyle."], "rating": ["3.5/5", "3/4", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "5/5", "2.5/4", "7", "", "4/5", "B+", "C+", "5/10", "2.5/4", "3.5/4", "4.5/5", "3/4", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Leigh Paatsch", "David Nusair", "Sean Axmaker", "Nell Minow", "Richard Schickel", "Mark Morris", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Rob Gonsalves", "Joe Lozito", "Philip Martin", "", "Ron Wells", "Robin Clifford", "Jeffrey Overstreet", "Dragan Antulov", "James Sanford", "Leonard Schwarz", "John R.
