{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Megan (Natasha Lyonne) considers herself a typical American girl. She excels in school and cheerleading, and she has a handsome football-playing boyfriend, even though she isn't that crazy about him. So she's stunned when her parents decide she's gay and send her to True Directions, a boot camp meant to alter her sexual orientation. While there, Megan meets a rebellious and unashamed teen lesbian, Graham (Clea DuVall). Though Megan still feels confused, she starts to have feelings for Graham.", "rating": "41", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 21m", "director": "Jamie Babbit", "studio": "IgniteEntertainment,Kushner-LockeInternational,HKMFilms,CheerleaderLLC", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$2.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Quirky, funny and full of quotable lines.", "There is no groundbreaking comedy, yet the film is consistently funny.", "An intentionally artificial romantic-comedy with a touch of memoir.", "I liked it well enough when I first saw it but remembered the actual humor as being predictable and insufficiently incisive. I thought more highly of it this time around.", "[But I'm a Cheerleader looks] like John Waters directing a hybrid of Private Benjamin and Girl Interrupted", "But I'm a Cheerleader is a smug little comedy that tries to mock other people's self-righteousness while ignoring its own.", "Lyonne makes the most of the material and But I'm A Cheerleader is a flawed-but-fun romp.", "I would have preferred to know more in documentary terms about the actual reality of these terrible camps, rather than sit through this heavy-handed and oddly lenient comedy.", "But I'm a Cheerleader often leans too hard on stereotypes in reaching for its laughs, but Lyonne and DuVall, who plays the tomboy Lyonne falls for, give nervy, on-target performances.", "First-time feature director Jamie Babbit's pink-drenched comedy is amusing and good-natured, but necessarily thin.", "It's hard to decide whether this is funny, offensive, satirical or all three.", "Lyonne blends hyperbole and sincerity in perfect proportions.", "But I'm a Cheerleader fizzles out of fresh ideas early on.", "As it happens, I couldn't agree more with the point of view of But I'm a Cheerleader, but I couldn't like the movie less.", "But I'm a Cheerleader, tries to be outrageous and inflammatory but falls pitifully flat.", "Brian Wayne Peterson's script is watered-downed John Waters -- a grotesque burlesque of a gay chick-flick.", "Both stylistic subversive and defiantly upbeat-it's one of the few prominent gay films of its era with a happy ending-it's a masterpiece of LGBT cinema. I suppose the 90s just weren't ready for it.", "What makes But I'm A Cheerleader so emotionally affecting is that despite the cotton-candy exterior, the film never lets its audience forget that these are people undergoing a traumatic experience.", "Director Jamie Babbit and screenwriter Brian Wayne Peterson haven't attacked their target as effectively as they might, but as mild as it may be, Cheerleader underscores the fact that gender roles are ideological in nature.", "Gay love satire for mature older teens and up."], "rating": ["", "3.0/4", "4/5", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "2.5/4", "3/5", "", "2/4", "", "", "", "9/10", "", "", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Bianca Garner", "Richard Propes", "Michael J.
