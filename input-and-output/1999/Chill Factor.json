{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A decade after chemical weapon \"Elvis\" kills 18 soldiers during a test, military scapegoat Andrew (Peter Firth) gets out of jail and tracks down scientist Richard (David Paymer) in Montana -- who shoots him. Andrew manages to tell his friend Tim (Skeet Ulrich) to get Elvis to safety at a fort 90 miles away. However, if exposed to a temperature higher than 50 degrees, the weapon will go off, so Andrew forces ice-cream-truck driver Arlo (Cuba Gooding Jr.) to help him transport the device.", "rating": "10", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Hugh Johnson", "studio": "MorganCreekProductions", "theater_date": "Sep 1, 1999", "dvd_date": "Dec 2, 2017", "box_office": "$11.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This dull and uninspiring mess has very little to offer other than an unoriginal idea in an under-utilised setting.", "This is a cookie-cutter buddy movie, as predictable as they come.", "Surprise, surprise -- as Identikit film-making goes, this is glossy, sharp and alarmingly enjoyable stuff.", "As an unintentional send-up of the predictability and wretchedness of modern action-comedies, Chill Factor is hilarious.
