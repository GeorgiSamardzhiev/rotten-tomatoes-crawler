{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After learning that her aunt, an elderly Mississippi widow (Patricia Neal), has taken her own life, Camille (Glenn Close) hatches an unusual postmortem plan. With her sister (Julianne Moore) in tow, Camille hides evidence that points to suicide, deciding instead to make the death look like a murder. Her scheme, fueled by vanity and greed, is not victimless, as it appears that a local handyman (Charles S. Dutton) might take the fall for a crime that never occurred.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 58m", "director": "Robert Altman", "studio": "MoonstoneEntertainment,Sandcastle5Productions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 1, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This is black comedy light, but you'll catch the undercurrent of ingrained racism in the hands of Glenn Close's villainess character Camille Dixon.", "This serio comedy about an eccentric Southern family is a minor work in Altman's oeuvre, but it's well acted and enjoyable.", "Despite several silly twists near the end, the acting is quite charming.", "This isn't great Altman but it's fun Altman.", "Despite some lovely performances (though, sad to say, Patricia Neal's isn't one of them) and charming moments, this meandering ensemble piece and its Tennessee Williams-ish finale is oddly out of character.", "Most of what transpires is low-key, affectionate comedy and a fair amount of fun.", "Cookie's Fortune is a wittily diagrammed portrait of a small town shaken to its roots by this deceptive calamity. The movie, though, never really becomes more than a diagram.", "The deceptively modest Cookie's Fortune may or not be Robert Altman's best film in years, but it is certainly his most pleasurable.", "[An] earthy, gently comic tale of death and family dysfunction.", "", "Legendary director Robert Altman gives us a crime movie that somehow makes an old story seem fresh and funny.", "What's so distinctively charming is the easygoing tone, which manages to turn black comedy into a strangely gentle, touching and delicate affair.", "The perfect melding of story, characters, actors and behind the camera talent, all under the expert control of Altman.", "", "Everyone loves a good murder mystery.
