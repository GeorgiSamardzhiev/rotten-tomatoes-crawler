{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Because of his eccentric habits and bafflingly strange films, director Ed Wood (Johnny Depp) is a Hollywood outcast. Nevertheless, with the help of the formerly famous Bela Lugosi and a devoted cast and crew of show-business misfits who believe in Ed's off-kilter vision, the filmmaker is able to bring his oversize dreams to cinematic life. Despite a lack of critical or commercial success, Ed and his friends manage to create an oddly endearing series of extremely low-budget films.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 4m", "director": "Tim Burton", "studio": "TouchstonePictures", "theater_date": "Sep 28, 1994", "dvd_date": "Oct 11, 2016", "box_office": "$5.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Burton has managed to make something altogether unique - a compassionate farce - that can be enjoyed even by people who have never heard of Wood, who would never willingly submit themselves to a Wood work.", "Landau is simply brilliant.", "A good story about the (out) of the star system in Hollywood in 1950's.
