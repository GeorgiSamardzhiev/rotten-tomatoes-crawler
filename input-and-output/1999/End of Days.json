[Blu-Ray]", "Peter Hyams's lurid, FX-happy thriller slams pieces of a dozen other movies into a noxious new compound. It has to be seen to be believed, but who'd want to?", "Never rises to the realm of exciting.", "Part of the degraded charm of End of Days is its buffet-table derivative approach.", "Starts by stealing bad ideas from other movies, then it putsthem together in the wrong order and casts the wrong actors to play the parts. In other words, it's one of the worst movies I've seen this year.", "", "", "End of Days isn't complete waste of time but all those who watch it would probably agree that this film's days were numbered long time ago.", "Sort of like listening to that old Toto album tucked away somewhere in your music collection. You remember thinking you used to like this kind of stuff, but you can't quite recall why.", "", "", "A lot of fun, but not a great movie.", "Idiotic beyond the point of redemption, this sinfully stupid farrago manages to insult audiences and critics, Christians and Satanists alike, reducing 2000 years of fertile mythology to the level of an incoherent pop video.", "Loud, lurid, bloody and ridiculously entertaining.", "Um filme de ao incessante que traz Arnold Schwarzenegger em uma das piores atuaes de sua carreira.", "Displaying precisely the imagination that gave the world such epic achievements as The Star Chamber and The Relic, Hyams dusts off America's designated import and goes with Arnie Schwarzenegger his own self."], "rating": ["", "", "2/5", "C+", "1.5/4", "", "2.5/4", "4/5", "", "2.5/5", "D+", "3/10", "", "1/4", "3.5/5", "2.5/5", "", "2.5/4", "3/5", "1.5/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Kathi Maio", "Paul Tatara", "Nell Minow", "Christopher Smith", "Peter Canavese", "David Ansen", "Michael Dequina", "Rob Gonsalves", "Jeffrey M.
