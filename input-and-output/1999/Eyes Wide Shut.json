Its depiction of honesty within a high class marriage and the consequences, is as valid as it is dangerous. [Full review in Spanish].", "Eyes Wide Shut (1999) is legendary director Stanley Kubrick's highly-anticipated, last completed film. It was titled 'Eyes Wide Shut' to imply self-contradictory opposites: at first being exposed or tempted, and then reflexively turning away...", "Eyes Wide Shut has gotten better with age. It was, in Nietzsche's word, untimely; its first audiences failed to understand it, while its real contemporaries had to bide their time.", "Eyes Wide Shut reveals new truths with each viewing.", "A film so willing to explore the limitations of masculinity, the limitations of heterosexuality, and the limitations of what fantasy looks like for a man who has none, is a decidedly interesting, and queer, work with which to end one's filmmaking career.", "This is not the steamy sexual extravaganza we have been promised, but it is provocative. In its own tormented way, Eyes Wide Shut is a valentine to monogamy.", "It was a knockout in the first round. Kubrick's fluid camerawork lulled them.", "This is, one might argue, what the audience has paid to see and what they've always wanted to see: the then-most famous couple in the world, at home in both the literal and figurative sense, unguarded and au naturel.", "In Eyes Wide Shut nothing works.", "Kubrick's final film is unique in his oeuvre for concluding on a note of apparent affirmation.", "A delicious, deadpan farce about the fragile masculine ego.", "This is finally a film that is better at mood than substance, that has its strongest hold on you when it's making the least amount of sense.", "It's empty of ideas, which is fine, but it's also empty of heat.", "At least Fellini pulled out the stops from the first minute when he wanted to get surreal. Here, realism fades into surrealism, then into outright foolishness. Morbidly paced foolishness.", "Cruise in particular lays himself open in that fiercely committed way that he tries everything as an actor.", "It's as rich and strange and riveting as any journey he's taken us on, yet it's also familiar in a disquieting way.", "The film does have that advertised haunting quality, and at least one performance from Kidman, in a supporting, but vital role that's as good as any we're likely to see this year.", "The price of Kubrick and Raphael's stubborn fidelity to the content if not the form of the novella is deadly.", "Maybe we should suspend the reductive question, \"Is it any good or not?\" and acknowledge that it's a fascinating, tantalising film that will continue to be argued about."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "A+", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "4/4", "3/4", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Craig Schroeder", "Federico Furzan", "Tim Dirks", "Cosmo Bjorkenheim", "Sean Fennessey", "Juan Barquin", "Sara Voorhees", "A.S.
