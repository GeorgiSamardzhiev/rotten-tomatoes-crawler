Oops, not only did I describe the story, I just gave the entire story away. Sorry.", "", "", "Pretty much a bad excuse to work in stand-up material courtesy of Griffin, scenes with Andrew Dice Clay, and buxom, naked chicks.", "It's probably more reasonable to evaluate it as an Eddie Griffin concert film.", "The film loses complete credibility when the audiences at the comedy clubs where Foolish works go wild with delight, way out of proportion to the hilarity of the material. And Foolish is just a little too smug about his artistic integrity.", "What would inspire someone who cannot write or act to pen and star in a movie?", "The whole thing has an off-puttingly thrown-together air.", "Balancing comedy with drama is tough for the best writers and even tougher for newcomers.", "", ""], "rating": ["C-", "", "1.5/4", "", "2/5", "0/4", "2/5", "1/5", "1.5/5", "1/5", "2/5", "1.5/4", "", "5", "1/4", "C-"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Owen Gleiberman", "Scott Tobias", "Maitland McDonagh", "", "Mark Halverson", "Michael Dequina", "Emanuel Levy", "Philip Martin", "Christopher Null", "Russell Smith", "Anita Gates", "Eugene Novikov", "Maitland McDonagh", "Cheryl DeWolfe", "Susan Stark", ""], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sacramento News &amp; Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieReport.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmcritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Austin Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Blather", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Journal International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Apollo Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Detroit News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly"], "date": ["September 7, 2011", "August 3, 2009", "August 3, 2009", "August 3, 2009", "August 7, 2008", "January 20, 2007", "September 7, 2005", "July 31, 2002", "April 10, 2001", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "April 9, 1999"]}}
