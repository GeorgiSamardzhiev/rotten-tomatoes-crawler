{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Forty-year-old pitcher Billy Chapel (Kevin Costner) is practically a dinosaur by professional baseball standards, fast approaching the end of his career. But, as Chapel stands on the mound pitching the game of his life, his thoughts don't turn to his prized history in sports, but rather return again and again to his tumultuous relationship with Jane Aubrey (Kelly Preston), a single mom who has stood at his side through the good and the bad but is now on the verge of leaving him.", "rating": "46", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 17m", "director": "Sam Raimi", "studio": "BeaconCommunications,TigProductions,UniversalPictures,MirageEnterprises", "theater_date": "Sep 17, 1999", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$35.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["\"Bull Durham\" is a more powerful movie than \"For Love of the Game,\" so Kevin Costner might be better as a savvy minor league catcher than a hall-of-fame major league pitcher, but the fact is, Costner is simply and utterly baseballic. He's baseballerific.", "Every scene away from the ballpark is in foul territory.", "For Love of the Game asks whether the same qualities that make an athlete a champion don't also destroy his happiness. The answer, unfortunately, is long-winded and redundant... But some of the baseball scenes are good.", "This is no perfect -- or even half-perfect -- game. It's another movie where conventions are subbed for life lessons, where the emotions are cued by golden oldies and where the motivation (at least on the studio's part) isn't love of the game but money.", "Here are two things that definitely don't go together: baseball and piano music.", "The baseball sequences are fabulous, not least because Costner looks and moves like a real player a rarity for actors in sports movies... But the love story, a five-year off-and-on affair, is little more than a sop to Costner's romantic faithful.", "On the field, Costner is consistent, but his exploration of Billy's romantic dilemma is superficial and often wooden.", "Those flashbacks will drive you nuts. As if baseball didn't drag on long enough, almost every inning or out of that Yankees game is punctuated by a memory.", "For love of the God, what is wrong with the once-likable Kevin Costner?", "I'm all for romance, you understand. But what makes this a drawback is that these people are all wrong for each other and that the filmmakers don't seem to know it.", "The rhythms of the game feel right; the rhythms of the romance feel embarrassingly Harlequin, and the picture drags on for over two hours.", "Kevin Costner is back starring in his third baseball movie, and after those two box office home runs, Mighty Kevin has struck out.", "Vanity is one thing, but Costner's act is beginning to feel like a particularly self-righteous -- and tiresome -- form of pathology. Someone should tell him that an actor's job is to disappear into his characters, not vice-versa.", "Not a frame reflects the distinctively edgy touch that director Sam Raimi brought to films as diverse as The Evil Dead and A Simple Plan.", "For Love Of The Game seems lost, as one overlong melodramatic interlude follows another, each more predictable than the entirely predictable game itself.", "For Love of the Game's earnestness seems itself like a desperate cry for attention.", "Far more horrifying than Evil Dead, Sam Raimi's attempt at making a sports-oriented romance strikes out, forfeits and loses three times before its two hours and 10 minutes are up.", "This guy is earnest, tireless, noble in his devotion to America's pastime and mostly dull as branch water.", "Under the confident direction of Sam Raimi, Mr. Costner gives a restrained but emotionally accessible performance.", "Like Billy this movie is good on the field, but not so much once off it."], "rating": ["4/5", "C", "", "2/4", "", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "", "", "", "", "", "1/4", "", "", "", "1/5", "", "", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mark Jackson", "Dennis Schwartz", "Michael Sragow", "Michael Wilmington", "Stephen Hunter", "Jack Mathews", "Desmond Ryan", "Desson Thomson", "Rod Dreher", "Jay Boyar", "David Edelstein", "Tom Sander", "Ann Hornaday", "Peter Travers", "Keith Phipps", "Theresa Everline", "Norene Cashen", "Joe Morgenstern", "Rex Reed", "Scott Nash"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Epoch Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slate", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rolling Stone", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro Times (Detroit, MI)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Observer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Three Movie Buffs"], "date": ["June 10, 2020", "April 13, 2017", "May 8, 2014", "May 8, 2014", "May 8, 2014", "May 8, 2014", "May 8, 2014", "May 8, 2014", "May 8, 2014", "May 8, 2014", "May 8, 2014", "May 8, 2014", "May 8, 2014", "May 8, 2014", "May 8, 2014", "May 8, 2014", "May 8, 2014", "May 8, 2014", "May 8, 2014", "March 29, 2011"]}}
