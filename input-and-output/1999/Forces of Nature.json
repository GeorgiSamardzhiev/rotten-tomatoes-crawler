{"metadata": {"synopsis": "All Ben Holmes (Ben Affleck) wants to do is make it from New York to Savannah, Ga., in time for his wedding. When a seagull and a hurricane ruin any chance he has of flying there, Holmes reluctantly joins the quirky Sarah Lewis (Sandra Bullock) in a rental car for a road trip back to his waiting bride-to-be, Bridget Cahill (Maura Tierney). But nature seems to conspire against his every attempt at a timely return -- and in the meantime, he finds himself growing closer to Sarah.", "rating": "45", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Bronwen Hughes", "studio": "DreamWorksSKG,Roth-ArnoldProductions", "theater_date": "Mar 19, 1999", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$52.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Over-the-top rom-com about marriage has dark, mature themes.", "", "", "Make no mistake: This slackly paced picture doesn't gel.

I am, so I liked it.", "A bumbling and typically charmless latter-day studio screwball comedy.", "", "It has all been done before, and better.", "For the most part this film is not particularly funny or entertaining. The plot is, of course, predictable.", "", "", "", "As soon as the co-stars become unlikely companions on a two-day trip to the South, a major problem crops up: no screen chemistry.
