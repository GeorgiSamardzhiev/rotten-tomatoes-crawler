{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Set in the changing world of the late 1960s, \"Girl, Interrupted\" is the searing true story of Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder), a young woman who finds herself at a renowned mental institution for troubled young women, where she must choose between the world of people who belong on the inside -- like the seductive and dangerous Lisa (Angelina Jolie) -- or the often difficult world of reality on the outside.", "rating": "53", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 7m", "director": "James Mangold", "studio": "ColumbiaPictures,RedWagonProductions,3ArtsEntertainment", "theater_date": "Jan 14, 2000", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Girl, Interrupted is well-performed but hollow - and ultimately unsatisfying.", "The film is entirely disposable. Watching a group of teenagers \"tongue their meds\" (which does not mean doing something rude with a junior doctor) and sobbing out of windows is boring.", "It's an interesting story, based on actual events.", "Powerful look at mental illness; ages 16+.", "Meaty roles for an eager young female ensemble. On that level, and on several others, the movie triumphs.", "Does it matter that every time Jolie's offscreen the film wilts a little? Ryder should be perfect as the bright spark; her lines are sharp as a knife. There's a gap, however, between what we hear and what we see.", "We end up getting thin supporters as seen through the eyes of a main character that doesn't do anything.", "Sounding like the scribblings from a teenager's diary, the 28-year-old Ryder lapses into self-parody.", "The two leads play to their strengths.", "The screenplay, by helmer Mangold, is by the numbers.", "", "The acting by Ryder, Jolie, and Goldberg is excellent enough to forgive the problems inherent in the script.", "", "Jolie enlivens every scene she's in --- so much so that whenever she's not on screen, many viewers go into a state of suspended animation waiting for her to come back.", "Girl, Interrupted\" is Hollywood's latest simple-minded treatment of mental illness.", "A muddled production that misses the jarring tone of the autobiographical book by Susanna Kaysen on which it is based. The film is entertaining, but not very powerful.", "A listless showcase of Hollywood clichs about crazy people, the '60s, and women, a reactionary, distaff Cuckoo's Nest.", "", "[Jolie's] rantings and ravings are so studied and predictable that her work here is truly one of the worst performances of all time.", "The drama makes the point that society still doesn't know how to deal with the multiple yearnings of women who don't want to follow in their mothers' path."], "rating": ["5/10", "", "A", "3/5", "4/5", "", "2/4", "2/5", "3.5/5", "C+", "3.5/4", "4.5/5", "4/4", "", "2/4", "2/4", "", "3/4", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Grant Watson", "Antonia Quirke", "Candice Frederick", "Hollis Griffin", "Rob Gonsalves", "Charlotte O&#39;Sullivan", "Jeffrey M.
