But this is a ferociously entertaining spectacle, with thrilling action sequences, eye-popping art direction and uniformly powerful performances.", "Ridley Scott takes an age-old formula and utilises it remarkably well, enhancing but never over-doing it with digital effects that help raise the ruins of the Colosseum and capture the magnificence and casual brutality of the culture.", "Gladiator certainly feels like it was written by committee and template.", "Russell Crowe solidly anchors this epic-scale gladiator movie - the first in nearly four decades - by using his burly frame and expressive face to give dimension to what might otherwise have been comic book heroics.", "It is monumental movie-making: visually thrilling, technically astonishing, and emotionally engaging.", "The film presents itself as worthy, but it's ultimately boring.
