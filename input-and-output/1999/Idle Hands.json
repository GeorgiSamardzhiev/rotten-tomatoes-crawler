{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When slacker teen Anton Tobias (Devon Sawa) has his right hand possessed by a demonic force, he finds that his life gets a lot more interesting. While Anton himself is an amiable guy, his hand proves to be an appendage of death, killing his two best buddies, Pnub (Elden Henson) and Mick (Seth Green), who return to life as wisecracking zombies. In addition to murdering those closest to him, Anton's evil hand significantly hinders his chances with lovely neighbor Molly (Jessica Alba).", "rating": "15", "genre": "Comedy/Horror", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Rodman Flender", "studio": "ColumbiaPictures,TriStarPictures,TeamTodd", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$4.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Anyone with the mental capacity to make it to high school will be embarrassed by the ineptness on display here.", "Offers some great splatter along with hilarious dialogue that will keep Sam Raimi buffs anxious for more.", "Too precariously straddles the line between fun and cheese, often going a bit too far over the top.", "", "Ganha pontos pelo perverso senso de humor, mas acaba soando demais como uma cpia de \"Evil Dead 2\" para merecer uma recomendao.", "Were you expecting a teen remake of The Hands of Orlac?
