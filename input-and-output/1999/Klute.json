{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This acclaimed thriller stars Jane Fonda as Bree Daniel, a New York City call girl who becomes enmeshed in an investigation into the disappearance of a business executive.

When it becomes clear that Daniel is being targeted, it's up to her and Klute to figure out who is after her before it's too late.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Mystery & Suspense/Romance", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "Alan J.

An essential watch.", "As close to a classic as anything New Hollywood produced.", "Persuasive script by Andy and Dave Lewis; elegantly muted Technicolor; high in its class.", "What lifts it above its B-picture origins (and the pastiche is certainly conscious) is the style -- crisp, elliptical, only moderately arty -- of Alan J. Pakula's direction.", "This is done with remarkably little dialogue but with a tremendous sense of tension and atmosphere.", "But Klute feels vibrantly alive in a way that betrays its subdued chilliness.", "While the plot mechanics work along the well-worn gears of any number of mystery-thrillers, the film catches and holds us because Bree is such a fascinating, enigmatic character.", "Klute is a cool film about a cool customer, but it's all a fa\u00e7ade... [I]t's more of a character study in thriller garb, and Bree's cool affect is mostly a well-honed act.", "There was no shortage of superb performances by lead actresses in the 1970s -- Diane Keaton in Annie Hall and Sally Field in Norma Rae are two that immediately come to mind -- but Jane Fonda's turn in Klute was not only great but also groundbreaking.", "A movie resolutely of its moment that still surges with third-rail electricity ...", "Playing a complex, sharpy written part, Jane Fonda won the Best Actress Oscar for her strongest dramatic performance in Alan Pakula's well mounted drmataic thriller", "Produced handsomely in New York, but directed tediously by Alan J. Pakula, the film is a suspenser without much suspense.", "One of the most important and influential movies of the early 1970s.", "[Fonda] makes all the right choices, from the mechanics of her walk and her voice inflection to the penetration of the girl's raging psyche. It is a rare performance.", "Sutherland is either an excellent sounding board for this nuanced portrait or he's a big zero, probably both. Fonda, however, transcends her limitations, making the most of her often forced quality as an actress.", "Fonda is simply a revelation, beautiful, sassy and streetwise, and yet hauntingly vulnerable. She deserved her Oscar in a role she has never bettered.", "For once, a genuinely psychological thriller."], "rating": ["", "3.5/5", "", "4.5/5", "", "", "", "", "7/10", "3/4", "", "3.5/4", "", "A-", "", "9/10", "", "4/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Piers Marchant", "Nicholas Bell", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Patrick McDonald", "Dave Kehr", "Dilys Powell", "David Robinson", "Derek Malcolm", "Nathanael Hood", "James Kendrick", "Kathy Fennessy", "Matt Brunson", "Melissa Anderson", "Emanuel Levy", "Variety Staff", "Tim Brayton", "Jay Cocks", "TV Guide Staff", "Film4 Staff", "Paul Taylor"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WBGR-FM (93.7 FM - Monroe, WI)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sunday Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Financial Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Retro Set", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Q Network Film Desk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Film Blog", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Frenzy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Village Voice", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out"], "date": ["December 11, 2020", "August 11, 2020", "May 12, 2020", "April 9, 2020", "February 18, 2020", "February 12, 2020", "February 12, 2020", "February 12, 2020", "January 9, 2020", "September 26, 2019", "August 26, 2019", "July 27, 2019", "November 24, 2015", "January 3, 2011", "July 7, 2010", "September 15, 2009", "August 30, 2009", "August 30, 2009", "August 30, 2009", "February 9, 2006"]}}
