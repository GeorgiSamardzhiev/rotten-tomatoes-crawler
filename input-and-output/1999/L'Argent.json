{"metadata": {"synopsis": "While collecting payment from a Paris photography shop, hard-working fuel delivery man Yvon Targe (Christian Patey) is purposefully given counterfeit money without his knowledge. When Yvon innocently uses the bills to pay for his lunch later that day at a local caf\u00e9, he narrowly avoids arrest but loses his job. To support his family, Yvon takes a new job with a criminal element, but his life continues nevertheless to spiral downward into the depths of violence and despair.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 24m", "director": "Robert Bresson", "studio": "France3Cin\u00e9ma,Marion&#39;sFilms,E\u00f4sFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 12, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Bresson's icy stare shows a life sunken into despair and misanthropy, suggesting L'Argent is only funny in a rich man's world.", "L'Argent has moments of great visual beauty.

It's also one of the better films.", "Bresson, working his sound track as assiduously as his visuals, once again makes us realize how little use most films make of the resources of the cinema. A masterpiece.", "A harrowing scour of ideological cinema.", "Compelling morality tale that works on multiple layers.", "Bresson -- who was eighty-two years old when the film came out, and clearly in no mood for mellowing -- frames the acts of wickedness, both great and small, with a terrifying calm.", "Harrowing crime film about the persecution of a working class man by the rich.", "...we can see Bresson's influence on Polish director Krzysztof Kieslowski, Yvon's curtly procedural trial and subsequent acts a precursor to \"A Short Film About Killing.\"", "This is a return to the extremes of crime and punishment that Bresson last used in Pickpocket; and as in that film, crime is a model of redemption and prison a metaphor for the soul.", "Bresson is not often noted for his engagement with social issues, but in fact his films consistently address the physical and spiritual effects of poverty and crime.", "", "blank in style and bleak in message... Yet like money itself, the value of L'Argent is no more or less than what one is willing to give it.", "Robert Bresson's film hits with the effect not so much reflecting a cleansing of the soul, but rather a ransacking.", "The ending, most of all, shows Bresson's ability to find an alternate route to grace, given the circumstances.", "L'Argent showcases the filmmaker at the height of his formal ingenuity, particularly his use of narrative ellipses and fragmented space (close-ups of legs, hands, objects).", "It's cold and clinical, and more than a little depressing.", "As others have pointed out, it does not feel like the work of a man in his 80s."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "B+", "", "", "5/5", "", "4/4", "", "", "3/5", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "Diego Gal\u00e1n", "Josh Larsen", "Paul Attanasio", "Witney Seibold", "Dave Kehr", "Michael Atkinson", "David Parkinson", "Anthony Lane", "Michael E.
