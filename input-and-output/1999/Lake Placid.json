Also, less than 4 minutes of screen time for the croc in a 78-minute movie? No thank you!", "This may be no more than a squib of a B movie, and it remains about as frightening as a fish tank, but, if you have any poetry in your soul, you will surely thrill to a film that ends with a crocodile sticking its head in a helicopter.", "Everyone is quirky, witty, sarcastic, and unique, cleverly scripted to be an odd fit for a man-eating reptile flick.", "Too many ingredients in this croc pot.", "It might not be the best, but it is notable for giving a spin to the predictable. [Full review in Spanish]", "Stay away unless you enjoy gross- out violence, and stay even farther away if you're an animal lover, since some of the most grisly attacks are aimed at cows who just want to chew their cuds in peace.", "With a pretty decent cast including Bill Pullman, Bridget Fonda, Oliver Platt, Brendan Gleeson, and Betty White, Lake Placid is a goofy time-waster with some serious bite that's entirely more fun than it should be.", "If you fancy something that isn't remotely brain-straining, this perfect popcorn entertainment could be for you.", "Fantastic stuff. Tense and silly and very, very funny, this is easily the best horror comedy for years.", "The lazy finale makes Lake Placid seem more marginal and forgettable than it already was, which is actually something of a feat.", "Miner's thoroughly unimaginative visual style sees to it that \"Lake Placid\" is not the least bit frightening, and the entire undertaking generates maybe one decent laugh. That is, if you don't count Fonda's chronic inability to act.", "Don't try to make it out to be more than a black comedy with a CGI croc on the loose, and you'll enjoy it just fine.", "In short, this is a great example of a late-90s, foul-mouthed monster movie with all kinds of laughs, one or two scares, and a firm grasp on the kind of movie it is. Check it out for sure.", "Lake Placid is an entertaining comedy thriller directed by Steve Miner and scripted by David E Kelley, the man who brought us Ally McBeal.", "A gloriously goofy movie about a 20-metre crocodile in a feeding frenzy on a once-docile inlet.", "A light-hearted monster movie that offers up plenty of laughs, Lake Placid is still a really fun and well-made creature feature that doesn't ever treat its characters- or the audience- like morons.", "You either find the nasty-minded writing amusing or you don't, and there's nothing left for the film to draw on if you don't.", "The whole movie's a giant croc.", "'I'm rooting for the crocodile,' announces Betty White. The line is funny and revealing: The film is smart enough to admit the monsters are usually the most interesting characters in these movies, but it's also smart enough to make the people interesting.", "Well worth the watch if only for its attempts to inject levity in what's just a simple nature run amok horror comedy."], "rating": ["2/5", "", "6/10", "", "3/5", "1/4", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "7/10", "", "", "3/5", "3.5/5", "4/10", "", "3/4", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Trace Thurman", "Anthony Lane", "Mike Massie", "Leah Rozen", "Fotogramas Staff", "CSM Staff", "Matt Donato", "Jo Berry", "Total Film Staff", "Stephen Thompson", "Paul Tatara", "IGN Staff", "Kyle Anderson", "Peter Bradshaw", "Leigh Paatsch", "Heather Wixson", "Tim Brayton", "Joe Morgenstern", "John Beifuss", "Felix Vasquez Jr."], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Horror Queers Podcast", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fotogramas", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">We Got This Covered", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNN.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IGN Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Nerdist", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Dead", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed"], "date": ["December 30, 2020", "November 30, 2020", "September 14, 2020", "July 9, 2019", "July 9, 2019", "July 9, 2019", "July 9, 2019", "July 9, 2019", "July 9, 2019", "July 9, 2019", "July 9, 2019", "July 9, 2019", "July 9, 2019", "July 9, 2019", "August 15, 2018", "January 7, 2016", "July 25, 2015", "December 13, 2014", "October 3, 2014", "July 22, 2014"]}}
