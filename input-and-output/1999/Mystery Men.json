{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Champion City already has a superhero, the appropriately named Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear), but that doesn't deter the city's seven quirky amateur crime-fighters, who use the Captain's capture at the hands of villain Casanova Frankenstein (Geoffrey Rush) as motivation to prove themselves. The only problem is that their strange powers -- silverware hurling, bowling, shovel skills, incompetent invisibility and deadly flatulence -- aren't doing them any favors.", "rating": "61", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h", "director": "Kinka Usher", "studio": "LawrenceGordonProductions,DarkHorseEntertainment", "theater_date": "Aug 6, 1999", "dvd_date": "Sep 10, 2015", "box_office": "$29.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A story that sparkles with emotional warmth, strong jokes and great performances from Hank Azaria, Janeane Garofalo, Lena Olin, Eddie Izzard, Greg Kinnear, William Macy, Geoffrey Rush and Ben Stiller.", "Even with its super cast, the slow-moving 'Mystery Men' falters in its attempt to spoof comic book heroes.", "It is good that the film has charm, for after a certain point it doesn't necessarily have anything else.", "Witty comic-book story is edgy, with lots of potty humor.", "Hugely entertaining -- especially for those with a thing for superheroes.", "The characters have been designed to make fun of themselves, disguising the craft of writer Neil Cuthbert and director Kinka Usher in getting us to laugh at them.", "Fails to come up with worthy gags and one-liners for the able cast.", "An instant cult comedy that doesn't walk or talk like anything else out there.", "How many laughs can you get out of a handful of one-joke characters?
