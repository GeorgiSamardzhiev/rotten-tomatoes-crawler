{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Josie Geller (Drew Barrymore), a baby-faced junior copywriter at the Chicago Sun-Times, must pose as a student at her former high school to research contemporary teenage culture. With the help of her brother, Rob (David Arquette), Josie infiltrates the inner circle of the most popular clique on campus. But she hits a major snag in her investigation -- not to mention her own failed love life -- when she falls for her dreamy English teacher, Sam Coulson (Michael Vartan).", "rating": "55", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Raja Gosnell", "studio": "Fox2000Pictures,FlowerFilms", "theater_date": "Apr 9, 1999", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$55.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Attempts to tap into the sense of missed opportunity that one inevitably leaves high school with.
