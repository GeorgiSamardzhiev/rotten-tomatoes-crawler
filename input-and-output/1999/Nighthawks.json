{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Fresh from mounting a devastating bomb attack in London, an international terrorist arrives in New York and remains intent upon wreaking further havoc.

[Full Review in Spanish]", "A thoroughly entertaining product of what now seems a more innocent time.", "One of Stallone's better efforts. Besides, where else can one find the screen being shared by the who's-who gallery of Rocky Balboa, Lando Calrissian, Roy Batty, the Bionic Woman, and the bald lady from the first Star Trek film?", "Criminally underseen yet solid gold.", "Nighthawks, an aggressively shallow police thriller pitting New York undercover cops against international terrorists.", "Stallone dresses in drag for his first onscreen appearance as a cop. This is one reel bad dude.", "This very effective thriller features a chilling performance by Hauer as the emotionless killing machine. Stallone and Williams are also credible, and the film makes good use of its New York locations.", "Though there's never much doubt how the duel will end, the climax is nonetheless surprising and totally satisfying, topping the energy of the previous pursuit.", "", "A taut urban thriller with a hissable villain and an unforgettable ending. One of Stallone's best films.", "A terrorist hijacking a cable car, even in New York, is a mildly ludicrous idea -- were no 747s handy?
