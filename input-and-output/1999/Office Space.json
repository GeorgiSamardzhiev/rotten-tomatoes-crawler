{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Corporate drone Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) hates his soul-killing job at software company Initech. While undergoing hypnotherapy, Peter is left in a blissful state when his therapist dies in the middle of their session. He refuses to work overtime, plays games at his desk and unintentionally charms two consultants into putting him on the management fast-track. When Peter's friends learn they're about to be downsized, they hatch a revenge plot against the company inspired by \"Superman III.\"", "rating": "80", "genre": "Comedy/Special Interest/Romance", "runtime": "1h 29m", "director": "Mike Judge", "studio": "Cubicle,Inc.", "theater_date": "Feb 19, 1999", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$10.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One of my favorite comedies", "Office Space will move you with its subtle philosophical theme and keep you entertained with jokes that contributed to the internet's age of memes.", "Not only made a satire on office life, but makes comments on white guys listening to gangster rap and inherent racism in the United States.

Still, the performers have a lot of fun getting there.", "With a judiciously executed hip-hop soundtrack and the same anti-conformist spirit that informs Judge's TV cartoons, \"Office Space\" can expect to attract people who aren't even old enough to be stuck in dead-end jobs.", "Imagine a live-action version of Dilbert, or In the Company of Men reconceived as a lighthearted romp, and you get the idea of Office Space, the auspicious live-action debut of Mike Judge.", "Isn't it a shame that people expect certain conventions from their movies -- niggling little things like interesting plots with beginnings, middles and ends, and maybe a little character development thrown in for good measure?", "Office Space, a knowing, somewhat slight, often hilarious sendup of cubicle culture, exploits the yuks in the chronic misery of those routinely exposed to the monotonous gray of corporate minds and company decor.", "This unconventional satire of work relationships and office politics is one of the oddest studio comedies in years.", "The film doesn't make a strong case for Judge to move beyond cartoons to live actors.", "The more you peer beneath the surface humor of Office Space the scarier and more serious its vision of contemporary existence becomes.", "A hilarious knockdown of corporate culture.", "The creator of Beavis and Butt- Head has made a laid-back, even subtle comedy that generally favors mischievous ironies over outlandish jokes.", "", "Office Space feels cramped and underimagined. I think Judge is capable of making an inspired live-action comedy, but next time he'll have to remember to do what he does in his animated ones -- keep the madness popping.", "So good, you should quit work to see it.", "A shapeless comedy of little merit.", "Frequently uproarious.", "A take-this-job-and-shove-it movie about the crushing malevolence of the corporate environment, it's on the verge of being really good."], "rating": ["", "", "3/5", "B+", "", "3/4", "3/4", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "3/4", "B+", "C", "", "2/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Rachel Wagner", "Joseph Dominguez", "Carey-Ann Pawsey", "Zaki Hasan", "Michael Rechtshaffen", "Jami Bernard", "Ann Hornaday", "Todd Anthony", "Rita Kempley", "Jason Caro", "Leah Rozen", "Kevin Thomas", "Michael Sragow", "David Sterritt", "Emanuel Levy", "Owen Gleiberman", "Film4 Staff", "Ian Nathan", "Joe Leydon", "David Edelstein"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rachel&#39;s Reviews (YouTube)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Inquiry", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orca Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Zaki&#39;s Corner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slate"], "date": ["October 19, 2020", "July 6, 2019", "March 17, 2019", "January 29, 2019", "February 20, 2018", "February 19, 2016", "November 4, 2013", "November 4, 2013", "November 2, 2013", "November 2, 2013", "November 2, 2013", "November 2, 2013", "November 2, 2013", "November 2, 2013", "September 9, 2012", "September 7, 2011", "March 12, 2010", "March 12, 2010", "March 12, 2010", "March 12, 2010"]}}
