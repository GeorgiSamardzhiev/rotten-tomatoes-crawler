{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this coming-of-age comedy, Tim Dunphy (Shawn Hatosy) is leading a go-nowhere existence, spending his days smoking pot and hanging out with his best friend, Drugs Delaney (Jon Abrahams). But Tim's lazy days of getting high are jettisoned after a brush with the law convinces his blue-collar dad (Alec Baldwin) to send him to a Connecticut prep school. The one saving grace of the new school is Jane (Amy Smart), a fellow student Tim falls for immediately.", "rating": "51", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Michael Corrente", "studio": "Miramax", "theater_date": "Sep 1, 1999", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$7.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This is a sweet, funny little movie, and with luck it can survive the marketing con job.
