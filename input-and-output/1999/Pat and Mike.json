{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Pat Pemberton (Katharine Hepburn), a college athletics instructor, enters a number of golf matches against female professionals. She holds her own until her well-meaning but condescending fianc\u00e9, Collier Weld (William Ching), turns up at the games and distracts her. Sports manager Mike Conovan (Spencer Tracy) sees her talent and offers to train her. After realizing that Pat stops trying when Collier is around, Mike works to keep them apart -- especially when he begins to develop feeling for her.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "George Cukor", "studio": "MetroGoldwynMayer,Loew&#39;sInc.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's a well-paced, light weight comedy with a facility for changing scene and mood that is thoroughly engaging throughout.", "Pat and Mike may not be as memorable as their other pairings but the romantic sports comedy stands up on its own against their other films.", "Its chief trouble is that it is packed with such long-drawn- out scenes as golfers lining up for crucial putts and carefully tapping a ball that is predestined by the script either to drop in or not to.", "Coming hot on the heels of  Adam's Rib  (1949), one of their most successful comedies, Pat and Mike feels a bit tired, and its lackadaisical pacing feeds into the general sense of ennui.", "The one that contains the classic line utilized in countless Tracy & Hepburn tribute pieces: \"Not much meat on her, but what's there is cherce.\"", "Pat and Mike, even though it was made almost 70 years ago, offers something much more interesting-a view of a man and a woman who find their way to equal partnership, each making the other better in the process.", "Ruth Gordon and Garson Kanin here wrote an engaging screenplay about emotion-without-display for their rare uncut diamonds.", "Original comedy, with a rich look at women's sports - and gender roles.", "The familiarity the two stars communicate goes far beyond the script.", "One of the season's gayest comedies.", "Tracy is given some choice lines in the script and makes much of them in an easy, throwaway style that lifts the comedy punch.", "One of the better Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn comedies -- not so much for the screenplay by Garson Kanin and Ruth Gordon, which lacks the bite and sophistication of Adam's Rib, as for the relaxed and graceful interplay of the stars.", "The best of the Spencer Tracy-Katharine Hepburn cycle.", "Slight sports comedy.", "The film doesn't have much plot but the dialogue is bright, and the roles tailor-made for stars Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn.
