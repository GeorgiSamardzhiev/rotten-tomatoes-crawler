{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this adaptation of Grace Metalious' popular novel, steamy goings-on abound in the small, prim New England community of Peyton Place. Newcomer Michael Rossi (Lee Philips) arrives in town on the eve of World War II and is soon involved with gorgeous but prudish shop owner Constance MacKenzie (Lana Turner), who keeps some secrets from her daughter, Allison. Amidst engagements and school graduations, Michael discovers seething, dark undercurrents that include rape, suicide -- and murder.", "rating": "65", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 37m", "director": "Mark Robson", "studio": "TwentiethCenturyFox", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Astonishingly, Grace Metalious' trashy best-seller novel about the scandalous goings-on in a small town in New England has been turned into quite an interesting movie.", "Once you fall in love with Peyton Place, you may never want to leave.", "Peyton Place, with its myriad plot threads and cast of characters is a rollicking good yarn with obvious melodramatic tensions borne from some very juicy themes.", "This is the kind of hypertensive trash that gives melodrama a bad name, cynically tempering its naughty bits with smug moralizing.", "Under Mark Robson's direction, every one of the performers delivers a topnotch portrayal.", "See it for 1950s' sexual mores if nothing else.", "Mark Robson's Hollywood version is far more enjoyable than the Grace Mattallius's trashy novel it's based upon, a quintessential small-town movie that in morality and other issues is sort of an ideological summation of the entire decade.", "It comes with its full quota of sex, conspiracy and violence, but the story is told in such circumspect fashion that next to nobody was offended.", "Effective melodrama with some satisfying emotional confrontations, particularly from Lana Turner.", "It's by turns gripping and silly.
