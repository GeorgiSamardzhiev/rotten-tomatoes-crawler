{"metadata": {"synopsis": "New York police officer Daniel Ciello (Treat Williams) is not a perfect cop. When Rick Cappalino (Norman Parker) from the U.S. Justice Department approaches him with a personal request to investigate police corruption, Ciello agrees -- provided he is not forced to turn in his fellow crooked cops. But as he delves deeper into the underbelly of drug crime, he realizes that it may be impossible to keep his promises. He will have to bring his friends down, or he'll end up going down himself.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 47m", "director": "Sidney Lumet", "studio": "OrionPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 21, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A model instance of the movie that insists on being a film and proceeds inevitably to assault our common sense with the counterfeit of a moral lesson.", "Williams gives a fine performance, the rest of the cast is also excellent, and director Sidney Lumet's eye for detail is sure throughout this authentic look at the dirtier side of police work.", "One of Sidney Lumet's most complex and detailed New York City dramas about the dark, dirty side of police work, boasting a splendid performance from Treat Williams in the lead.", "Directs another Serpico, but with improvements.", "Director Sidney Lumet is in firm control of the sprawling canvas, showing in spades his ability to harness intense energy and almost uniformly top-rate performances from a cannily-cast stable of solid character actors.", "The movie that should've turned Treat Williams into a huge star. This is one of Sidney Lumet's finest hours.", "", "While there is still much to like in the film...it's a long, winding haul to the finish.", "", "An astonishing in-depth portrait of the interlocking worlds of police and hoodlum results, with no punches pulled and no easy solutions.", "Treat Williams courageously fights police corruption.", "", "", "After the film starts to turn itself over in your mind, it becomes a much deeper piece, a film about how difficult it is to go straight in a crooked world without hurting people you love.", "\"Prince of the City'' begins with the strength and confidence of a great film, and ends merely as a good one. The achievement isn't what it first promises to be, but it's exciting and impressive all the same.", "", "", "It's lengthy (almost three hours), gritty and almost highly involving, while Williams is superb as the man who, despite the honesty of his actions, is made to feel like the bad guy.", "", ""], "rating": ["", "3/4", "A-", "B", "", "3/5", "3/5", "5/10", "4/5", "", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/4", "", "3/5", "4/5", "", "5/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Murray Kempton", "", "Emanuel Levy", "Dennis Schwartz", "Variety Staff", "Caffeinated Clint", "Christopher Null", "John J.
