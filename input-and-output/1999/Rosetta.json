{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Belgian 17-year-old Rosetta (\u00c9milie Dequenne) lives in a dilapidated trailer that has no running water, with only her indigent and alcoholic mother (Anne Yernaux) for company. After losing her job at a food processing plant, the teen struggles to find work in a bid to avoid falling into the same traps as her mother, but is rebuffed at every turn. Only Riquet (Fabrizio Rongione), who works at a nearby waffle stand, seems to care for Rosetta, but even that budding friendship has a price.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Luc Dardenne, Jean-Pierre Dardenne", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 14, 2012", "box_office": "$261.5K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The Dardennes convey so much using so little, the seemingly strung together nature of the film ultimately containing a very specific and carefully plotted structure that brings a gravity to even the most mundane of events.", "A marvelous exposition of the continuing importance of cinema highlighting social barriers and conflict.", "There's something genuinely religious in Rosetta's stark portrayal of unyielding resurrection.", "a small miracle of a film, one that accomplishes so much with seemingly so little and feels all of a piece, not a moment wasted or misused", "The camera follows right behind Rosetta as she stampedes her way through hardship after hardship, determined to get a fair shake. This puts the viewer in the shoes of Rosetta and we experience her pain firsthand.", "Rosetta (is) a perpetual motion machine constantly racing away from a lens that will always catch up to her.", "", "", "'An unflinching portrait of the dehumanizing effects of being forced to live hand-to-mouth with no real hope of escaping.'", "Perhaps some of this would have been nominally interesting if Rosetta were slightly likable.", "", "", "", "Fights and struggles to stay afloat literally and symbolically, just like its heroine.", "The drama vividly conveys the stunted emotional and spiritual life of a teenager who has no time for anything except the struggle to survive.", "Some viewers (including a few who walked out when I saw the movie) are going to find the subject too grim and the production too stark - but that's the idea.", "a careful, painful film, but beautiful in its execution", "The film has an odd subterranean power. It doesn't strive for our sympathy or make any effort to portray Rosetta as colorful, winning or sympathetic. It's a film of economic determinism, the story of a young woman for whom employment equals happiness.", "", ""], "rating": ["3.5/4", "5/5", "4/4", "4/4", "3/4", "9/10", "A", "4/5", "4/4", "1/4", "3/5", "3/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "3/4", "", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Matthew Lucas", "Kaleem Aftab", "Rob Humanick", "James Kendrick", "Eric Melin", "Christopher Long", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Emanuel Levy", "Derek Smith", "Michael Dequina", "Rob Blackwelder", "Shannon J.
