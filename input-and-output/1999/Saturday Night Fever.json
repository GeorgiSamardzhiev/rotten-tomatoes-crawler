{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Tony Manero (John Travolta) doesn't have much going for him during the weekdays. He still lives at home and works as a paint store clerk in his Brooklyn, N.Y., neighborhood. But he lives for the weekends, when he and his friends go to the local disco and dance the night away. When a big dance competition is announced, he wrangles the beautiful and talented Stephanie (Karen Lynn Gorney) to be his partner. As the two train for the big night, they start to fall for each other as well.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "John Badham", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 6, 2014", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["John Travolta is far better than any previous exposure would indicate; his Tony Manero is suitably tough and punkish, but there is also a warmth and vulnerability that make him very appealing.", "Leaving aside any social commentary that the film does not address, this Saturday night is not safe from reproducing well-known cliches.
