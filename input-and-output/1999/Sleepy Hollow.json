{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Set in 1799, \"Sleepy Hollow\" is based on Washington Irving's classic tale \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow.\" Faithful to the dreamy custom-bound world that Irving paints in his story, the film mixes horror, fantasy and romance and features an extraordinary cast of characters that dabble in the supernatural.", "rating": "69", "genre": "Horror/Mystery & Suspense/Romance", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Tim Burton", "studio": "MandalayPictures,ParamountPictures,AmericanZoetrope,ScottRudinProductions", "theater_date": "Nov 19, 1999", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$101.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Sleepy Hollow represents the height, or at least the meridian, of Tim Burton's career as a master of mixing mythology, horror and humor. Oh, to have him back again.", "Pickering's wide, tremulous eyes reflect the film's lurid appeal to youthful terrors.", "There are lots of slasher movies better than this.", "It is a horror film, but it's a Tim Burton horror film. Make no mistake about that.", "Burton piles on the artistic gore for this rendition. He just forgets to add the terror.", "The quirks of this Sleepy Hollow prevent it from ever being truly scary, but what they do make it is a quintessentially Burton film.", "A film which looks great but, in the end, is not the sum of its body parts.", "For about an hour it's a fine, ghoulish carnival sideshow, and that has its charms, but there's a thin desperation about the climax.", "[Burton's] vision of the ominous woods, the shadowy town, and its pale inhabitants give the film texture and bring it to life.", "There's no great messages here, just love and visual mastery. At that Burton succeeds admirably.", "This updated story is a real showcase for Johnny Depp, whose collaborations with Tim Burton represent some of the actor's best work.", "Sleepy Hollow is, above all, beautiful to look at. Instead of using effects to make things look real, Burton makes everything look like a painting.", "Burton, for all his skill, never ranges beyond the thrills of the obvious; he doesn't enlarge the meaning of the horror he shows us, the way a Brian De Palma might.", "Burton's visual sensibilties are always breathtaking.", "often feels akin to the Hammer horror movies made in England during the 1950s and 1960s, the spooky/gory spectacles that broke new ground in presenting on-screen violence.", "", "The Burton trademark special effects are typically fun, but the late release and lackluster performances make Sleepy Hollow feel exactly like its title: sleepy and hollow.", "Gorgeous to watch, but lacking in a sound emotional core.", "Sleepy Hollow is the great, gory family film of the year. Heads will indeed roll.", "No longer a prodigy at age 41, Tim Burton has now become a problem; I still find myself watching his movies with bemused tolerance, thinking surely he'll be a great director when he grows up."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "3.5/4", "2/5", "5/5", "2/5", "3.5/4", "2.5/4", "", "", "", "B+", "B-", "", "B", "3/4", "2/4", "3/5", "3/4", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Christopher Lloyd", "Jan Stuart", "Nell Minow", "Ken Hanke", "Ted Murphy", "Michael Dequina", "Joe Lozito", "Derek Adams", "Jeffrey M.
