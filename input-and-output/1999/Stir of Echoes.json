I just hope audiences go for a supernatural thriller that's a little messier and doesn't feel the need to claw at their heart for two hours.", "The cast is uniformly good, with Bacon giving the strongest performance as blue-collar Tom.", "", "Bacon's performance is what makes it more than just another dead-person-walking-the-earth story. Bacon is truly a man possessed.", "", "Ultimately, it is Bacon's blue-collar conflict that resonates.", "A psychological thriller about the dark side of having highly developed psychic abilities.", "", "Disturbing imagery, great timing, and strong acting by the leads.", "A startling film that is exacting and personal and resonant.", "Even if the ending seems a bit tidy, the film is still effective and nicely creepy -- definitely worth seeing.", "Most of the echoes are stirred up from earlier, better movies."], "rating": ["", "", "3/4", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "2.5/4", "4/5", "B", "3/4", "4.5/5", "3/4", "", "", "2.5/4", "4/5", "", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Dan Buffa", "David Ansen", "David Nusair", "", "Lisa Alspector", "Joe Lozito", "", "Jeffrey M.
