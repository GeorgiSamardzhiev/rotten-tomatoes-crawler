{"metadata": {"synopsis": "During the summer of 1977, a killer known as the Son of Sam keeps all of New York City on edge with a series of brutal murders. The philandering Vinny (John Alberto Leguizamo) unwittingly almost becomes a victim of the psychopath, and soon he and numerous people in his orbit -- including his wife, Dionna (Mira Sorvino), his punk-rocker friend, Ritchie (Adrien Brody), and aspiring porn star Ruby (Jennifer Esposito) -- are trying to figure out the identity of the killer, before it's too late.", "rating": "51", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 22m", "director": "Spike Lee", "studio": "TouchstonePictures,40Acres&amp;AMuleFilmworks", "theater_date": "Jul 2, 1999", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$19.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Never quite pays off, with stilted dialoguing plaguing otherwise fine performances from Mira Sorvino and John Leguizamo.", "...it was such an unexpected, marginal tale.", "...a scorching melodrama about childhood friends-played by John Leguizamo and Adrien Brody-whose relationship reaches an emotional boiling point.", "One of Spike Lee's most dynamic pictures, so electric and overflowing with energy it's damn near exhausting.", "Summer of Sam, for all its flash and well-crafted fury, is only superficially disturbing. It's a nightmare stroll down memory lane: feel-bad nostalgia.", "A deliberately overblown MEAN STREETS parody", "This ultimately disappoints, but it is good to see Lee branch out into subjects which don't immediately lend themselves to his single-minded politicizing.", "Like most of Lee's work, this bites off more than it can chew, but the breadth and energy are impressive.", "The film is sloppy and ill-formed, its tone lurching drunkenly from turgid soap opera to soft-core porn, descending at times to low camp.", "This is trashy exploitation at its clumsiest. Once more, a Spike Lee movie has been undone by the earnestness of being important.", "Trouble is, the overlong narrative, however entertaining from minute to minute, is a mess.", "I needed stronger and more balanced characters to really care what happened.", "Whatever you think of Spike Lee, when he has the faith in his talent and material and is able to be political without the dogma, he's one of the best filmmakers to come out of America in the 1980's.", "Lee does capture the terror a serial killer can wreak upon the community, but his concentration on the weak characters hurts in the long run.", "The story makes very important points, and shows us a graphic parable of the wages of sin. But the ugliness along the way will be too much for some viewers....", "Disappointing.", "Spike Lee's most ambitious movie, is joltingly inspired at times. It's also offensively redundant and needs editing.", "The cast sizzles.", "An intelligent, compassionate, adult story told to thrilling, fearsome effect.", "...tremendous, haunting, multi-textured ..."], "rating": ["1/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "1/5", "", "", "2.5/4", "4/5", "C+", "B-", "5/10", "3/4", "3/4", "3.5/4", "A"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "Eve Tushnet", "Adam Nayman", "Sean Burns", "David Ansen", "Henry Stewart", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Jim Lane", "Andrew Sarris", "Geoff Andrew", "Jeffrey M.
