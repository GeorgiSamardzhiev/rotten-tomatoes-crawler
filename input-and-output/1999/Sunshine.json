But the acting is uniformly dull, the cast is deadpan, poker-faced and robotic at best.", "[Sunshine] delivers the visually incarnate truth of the universe's mysticism.", "In an age of technical advancements when filmmakers have circumvented ideas for synthetic visual thrills, here is a movie that plays like some decisive, brilliant rebellion to that pattern.", "", "", "Don't pack a tube of SPF 50 to the theater; bring a can of Jolt or a double espresso.", "\"Sunshine's\" mostly cerebral adventure into unquantifiable science and human nature makes its huh-what conclusion more forgivable. Loopy as it gets, once the Icarus II sets a course for the heart of the sun, \"Sunshine\" becomes a head-trip and a half.", "Sunshine is a fantastically enjoyable film that works our minds, delights our senses and shows that futuristic science fiction can be serious drama rather than mere popcorn fodder.", "Garland and Boyle are nothing if not ambitious.
