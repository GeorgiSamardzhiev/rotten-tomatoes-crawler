{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Emmet Ray (Sean Penn) isn't an easy guy to be around -- among other things, he's inconsiderate and egomaniacal. He also happens to be a jazz guitarist with undeniable talent, and despite his many faults, he ends up winning the heart of Hattie (Samantha Morton), a kind young mute woman. Hattie's seemingly endless patience with Emmet is tested, however, with his incessant irresponsibility and infidelity, leading their relationship to the breaking point.", "rating": "77", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Woody Allen", "studio": "SweetlandFilms,MagnoliaPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$4.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The subtitle could be \"Everything You Always Hated About Woody Allen.\"", "", "Woody Allen, in his thirtieth outing as writer-director, still shows signs of change, improvement, depth of feeling.", "", "Thanks to Morton's presence, it gets closer to the sweetness of the wonderful Everyone Says I Love You.", "Focusing on the story, the auteur explores his two favorite topics, jazz and s----heels, to enter the new millenium in style.", "... seems to be the latest chapter in a great work on the artist's search for meaning, for self-worth, for redemption.", "If you aren't sure you like jazz, see this movie just to be exposed to the Django sound!
