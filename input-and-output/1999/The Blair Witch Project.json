{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Found video footage tells the tale of three film students (Heather Donahue, Joshua Leonard, Michael C. Williams) who've traveled to a small town to collect documentary footage about the Blair Witch, a legendary local murderer. Over the course of several days, the students interview townspeople and gather clues to support the tale's veracity. But the project takes a frightening turn when the students lose their way in the woods and begin hearing horrific noises.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Horror", "runtime": "1h 27m", "director": "Daniel Myrick, Eduardo S\u00e1nchez", "studio": "HaxanFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 15, 2015", "box_office": "$140.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A testimony to the power of marketing a film.", "The most remarkable thing about Donahue's work in this movie is that she is rarely seen on camera. She brings depth and emotional nuance to Heather's character through just her voicework and breathing.", "Sanchez and Myrick are also smart enough not to undercut the potency of their tale by attempting to explain the unexplainable. They leave us with a mystery capable of haunting our dreams.", "One of its great strengths is that it breaks the teenage bloodbath formula. There is not a Jason or a Freddy to be found. Instead, Blair Witch is a thinking person's horror movie that exploits the imagination's power to terrify.", "The scenario unfolds with so much real and raw emotion that it feels claustrophobic.", "A revelation in storytelling, cinematography, and marketing.", "Your friends lied to you when they said you needed to watch this film once before you die. Considered a horror classic, but this found footage movie has been severely overhyped.", "There was a considerable number of people who went to go see The Blair Witch Project believing it was a documentary. That's how uncommercialized found footage was as a conceit, and how elegantly crafted this movie is.", "Directors Sanchez and Myrick understand the lure of legend and storytelling to the horror genre, and they cleverly choose to wrap the film up in various Russian Doll layers.", "The scariest shots, from someone's little Hi-8 camcorder, document the students losing their bearings, giving way to panic and finally falling victim, though off screen, to some ineffably, unphotographably evil presence.", "Whenever night falls, the movie takes off, but in a slow creep, with all your childhood fears of the dark suddenly revealing themselves as absolutely reasonable.", "The very crudeness of the film stock and technique contribute mightily to the feeling that things are out of control, disoriented and possibly subject to unnatural laws.", "Easily the scariest horror picture of the '90s, a movie that can take a place among the most potent and inexorable of modern shockers, like Night of the Living Dead or The Texas Chain Saw Massacre.", "It is a triumph of intelligence over special effects, guerrilla filmmaking over Hollywood spectacle.", "Feel free to admire it: As a cheeky, clever stunt, it deserves it. Enjoying it fully might be a bit more difficult.", "The abrupt, unforgiving way the film ends is still shocking despite all the film's imitators, and it's a strong finish to a film that spends a little too much time wandering.", "No doubt part of the reason that the film has affected some viewers so intensely is because it requires them to fill in a lot of blank spaces, to exercise a perceptive muscle which, especially among younger viewers, may have grown flabby from neglect.", "Scary without being explicit, it's a 1990s cinematic landmark, and best judged away from the hype.", "Don't go see The Blair Witch Project alone; it's too scary to sit through without company. Thrillingly, nauseatingly so.", "You can dismiss The Blair Witch Project as a trick. Or you can give in to the treat and savor that rarest of accomplishments in a field notorious for tedium and repetition -- an original horror movie."], "rating": ["2.0/4", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "3.5/4", "", "7/10", "", "4/5", "", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Sez\u00edn Koehler", "Kathi Maio", "Brian Bethune", "Karl Delossantos", "Alyssa Bereznak", "Chauncey K.
