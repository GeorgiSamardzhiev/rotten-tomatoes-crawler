You don't know from dull.", "The script by Wincer and Eric O'Keefe is a maudlin mess right from the word go, and if any film this year has been filled with more treacle-laden melodrama I certainly have not seen it.", "A tale of heart-wrenching tragedy and uplifting triumph that never quite hits its stride.", "Although it canters down a well-trod path toward a predictable finish line, The Cup sustains interest through the smooth efficiency of its storytelling and the engaging performances of its lead players.", "It's a very decorous picture in which a sense of conflict is largely lacking.", "Even the most ardent lover of feel-good biopics would have a hard time backing this horse.", "I found The Cup to be a pleasant-enough viewing experience. At the same time, I was never as riveted as I have been by other, similarly-themed films. It makes you feel good without ever truly stirring the soul.", "One wonders who the audience is for a film this far removed from the dirt and grime of the reality it claims to be based on, and why they find anything so squeaky-clean appealing.", "Director Simon Wincer, who also co-wrote the screenplay, was not the right person to avoid certain temptations, like dunking the audience's noggins into a honey pot of clichs.", "The hybrid feel of it all works, and the inevitable uneven moments didn't bother me, nor did the odd story clich.", "I wouldn't back this donkey.", "It's a shamelessly old-fashioned picture but if you like horses and fancy cantering off into the land of wish-fulfilment for a couple of hours, why not?", "The Cup has certainly been released at the right time to cash in on Spring Racing Carnival fever. But not all paying punters will be pleased with the final dividend returned.", "There's a lot of interesting stuff here but in the end it's a bit disappointing.", "The Cup doesn't dig deeply enough into its characters. Everyone is portrayed in a positive light and it's as if the writers were too afraid to challenge the audience.", "Let's face it, better to be a crowd pleaser than a critic pleaser.", "The problem is that everyone is so nice. It's as if the film has to pussyfoot around not to offend any of the people depicted in the film because they are mostly still alive, so the tension is really all internal,", "Director Simon Wincer is unable to convey this tale in a manner that would elevate it beyond the experience of reading the condensed, chronological series of events on Wikipedia.", "Talk about product placement: there are times when The Cup resembles a feature-length advertisement for the race itself."], "rating": ["3/5", "1.5/4", "1.5/4", "2.5/5", "", "2/4", "2/5", "2.5/4", "0/4", "", "", "2/5", "3/5", "2/5", "3/5", "C+", "1.5/5", "3/5", "2/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Renee Schonfeld", "Roger Moore", "Sara Michelle Fetters", "Betsy Sharkey", "Joe Leydon", "Soren Andersen", "Barbara VanDenburgh", "Mike McGranaghan", "Calum Marsh", "Luke Buckmaster", "Jason Di Rosso", "Matt Neal", "Sandra Hall", "Leigh Paatsch", "David Stratton", "Matthew Toomey", "Jim Schembri", "Margaret Pomeranz", "Simon Miraudo", "Tom Ryan"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tribune News Service", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MovieFreak.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arizona Republic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Aisle Seat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slant Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Daily Review/Crikey", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MovieTime, ABC Radio National", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ABC Radio (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sydney Morning Herald", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">At the Movies (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ABC Radio Brisbane", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Age (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">At the Movies (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Quickflix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Age (Australia)"], "date": ["July 8, 2014", "December 31, 2012", "May 15, 2012", "May 11, 2012", "May 10, 2012", "May 10, 2012", "May 10, 2012", "May 9, 2012", "May 8, 2012", "November 21, 2011", "October 14, 2011", "October 13, 2011", "October 13, 2011", "October 13, 2011", "October 13, 2011", "October 13, 2011", "October 12, 2011", "October 12, 2011", "October 11, 2011", "October 11, 2011"]}}
