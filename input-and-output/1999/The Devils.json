{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 17th-century France, Father Grandier (Oliver Reed) is a priest whose unorthodox views on sex and religion influence a passionate following of nuns, including the sexually obsessed Sister Jeanne (Vanessa Redgrave). When the power-hungry Cardinal Richelieu (Christopher Logue) realizes he must eliminate Grandier to gain control of France, Richelieu portrays Grandier as a satanist and spearheads a public outcry to destroy the once-loved priest's reputation.", "rating": "67", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Ken Russell", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,RussoProductions", "theater_date": "Jul 16, 1971", "dvd_date": "Oct 13, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["What I find such a pity is that Russell should apparently so distrust his own skill as a mesmerising story-teller.", "About facts at any rate, and as cinematic reconstructions go, The Devils seems to be pretty accurate. But it is startlingly unsuccessful in moving its audience.", "What is quite certain is that Russell has been true to himself as never before and that in doing so, he will irritate, excite, bore and outrage more film-goers than ever before.", "Even more than The Music Lovers, The Devils reveals an infantile compulsion to shock and repel, cost what it will.", "'The Devils' is a benchmark of transgression and profane cinema, a hidden jewel of the genre. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Despite its superb acting, gratuitous excesses turn this short baroque opera into a simple comic opera. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The truly provocative -- some might even say blasphemous -- part of the film is its assertion that, even while preaching their rhetoric of sin and salvation, nuns and priests and cardinals are only human, and humans are nothing but animals.", "It's scandalous in that it talks about things people generally aren't prepared for and it does so with the sharp edge of satire. After seeing the film, you'll know full well who, in Ken Russell's supposition, the real Devils are.", "It is like a lunatic opera, an attempt to make a furious poem out of frenzy. Russell's flamboyant theatricality and his interest in the perverse have been too much imposed on his other films; but here, style and subject are perfectly matched.", "It's an experience which pulsates and perverts, especially in those glorious moments when Russell slaps the sacred directly in its frescoed face... In this brilliant film, nothing is safe: not God, not Satan, not man, not their collective meaning.", "Weird, disarmingly funny, and stuffed to the gills with inspired visuals and intense framing from [director of photograph] David Watkin, The Devils is a masterpiece.", "All the events and persons depicted in The Devils are intended to be confused with actual events and persons. How do I know? Ken Russell tells me so.", "Bruegel couldn't have captured the insanity better.", "Whatever the moral perspective, it keeps you gripped right to the end.", "The set design, by future director Derek Jarman, is probably the most successful element of the film.", "Never letting up its energy, 'The Devils' is eye-ride.", "Reed carries the film with an admirably restrained portrayal of the doomed priest. Redgrave, on screen only sporadically, is stunning as the salacious sister.", "No matter how thickly Russell piles on the masturbating nuns, tortured priests and dissolute dauphins, there's no getting round the fact that it's all more redolent of a camp revue than a cathartic vision.", "Ken Russell at his excessively visual best and dramatic worst.", "Twisted genius."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "1", "5/5", "0/4", "A-", "3/5", "2/5", "", "", "", "A-", "5/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Margaret Hinxman", "Dilys Powell", "Derek Malcolm", "David Robinson", "Jorge Loser", "Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos", "Katie Rife", "Kyle Anderson", "Jay Cocks", "Bill Gibron", "Nicholas Bell", "Roger Ebert", "Laura Clifford", "Jake Hamilton", "TV Guide Staff", "Donald J.
