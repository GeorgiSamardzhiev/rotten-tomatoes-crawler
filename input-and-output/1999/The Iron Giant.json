{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this animated adaptation of Ted Hughes' Cold War fable, a giant alien robot (Vin Diesel) crash-lands near the small town of Rockwell, Maine, in 1957. Exploring the area, a local 9-year-old boy, Hogarth, discovers the robot, and soon forms an unlikely friendship with him. When a paranoid government agent, Kent Mansley, becomes determined to destroy the robot, Hogarth and beatnik Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick Jr.) must do what they can to save the misunderstood machine.", "rating": "96", "genre": "Animation/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 26m", "director": "Brad Bird", "studio": "WarnerBrothers", "theater_date": "Aug 4, 1999", "dvd_date": "Apr 3, 2008", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Fuses Cold War paranoia with a science-fiction/horror B-movie template to create an entertaining, action-filled, and clearly disclosed parable.", "...an incredible achievement in both narrative and animation.", "I found The Iron Giant to be a completely engaging movie experience. I laughed. And, yes, I cried, too. Moreover, I felt like I'd really gotten my money's worth when I left the theater after watching it.", "The Iron Giant should have been immediately recognized as a near-perfect, classical expression of imagination, combining childlike wonder and adult sophistication.", "Robot Lessons Learned: - How many movies are just Short Circuit? - We understand why Hogarth doesn't have friends. - Vin Diesel's voice acting niche....", "This is, full stop, one of the best animated movies of all time; an enduring classic.", "It is beautiful and moving and the animation is gorgeous.", "The Iron Giant captures and crystallizes its source material's anxious, humane spirit. It might be the most empathetic and exhilarating mainstream American animated feature ever made.", "It doesn't try to hide its own cleverness, it's funny and pulls in references from all over the place, from Bambi to Frankenstein.", "Tender, moving and exciting for kids (and their secretly tearful parents).", "Watching this again 17 years after its original release, I savoured again the resemblances to Spielberg, Wilde and Brian Forbes's Whistle Down the Wind.", "In every way, one of the highlights of both animation and family-friendly cinema in the last quarter-century.", "While youngsters will enjoy the film on one level, it reaches out to adults on a completely different plane. They will see an allegory about power and politics and the danger of allowing either to run roughshod over humanity.", "This is not exactly standard children's fare, but kids (and their parents) should be smitten by its wit and wisdom.", "This is sharp, sophisticated stuff, appreciated on different levels by both parents and children, and even those who are neither. The film has impish humor, great adventure and more than a few thrills.", "Wisely, Bird and company eschew the standard Disney formula of catchy show tunes and cuddly animal sidekicks and lead Warner Bros. toward an animation style the studio can call its own.", "A magical evocation of a special time in history and a time in everybody's life when the dream and the nightmare quotients are equally high.", "The Iron Giant's theme of fear of the unknown is craftily balanced against the power of innocent imagination.", "The film isn't as blisteringly satirical as The Simpsons; it's warmer. And while its nostalgia isn't simplistic, it is affectionate.", "The Iron Giant is not only the best animated feature to be released this summer, it's the single best film to hit our screens so far this year."], "rating": ["8/10", "", "", "", "", "", "1", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "1", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Drew Dietsch", "Kathi Maio", "Armond White", "Leona Laurie", "Miles Surrey", "Rachel Wagner", "Adam Nayman", "Dorothy Woodend", "Kate Muir", "Peter Bradshaw", "Tim Brayton", "Jeff Strickler", "David Ansen", "Matt Soergel", "Dennis King", "Peter Keough", "F.X.
