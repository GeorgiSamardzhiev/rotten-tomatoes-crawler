{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1933 a boy discovers an ancient Native American in a sideshow carnival tent. The Indian is Tonto (Johnny Depp), the old companion of John Reid (Armie Hammer), a lawman more famously known as the Lone Ranger. With this opportunity to set the record straight about his and Reid's adventures, Tonto recalls the day in 1869 when he first encountered the man who would be his trusted friend and tells of their teamwork bringing down Butch Cavendish (William Fichtner) and other Old West outlaws.", "rating": "30", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Kids & Family/Western", "runtime": "2h 29m", "director": "Gore Verbinski", "studio": "BlindWink,InfinitumNihil", "theater_date": "Jul 3, 2013", "dvd_date": "Nov 22, 2015", "box_office": "$89.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's hard to believe that as each year goes by, despite the substantial advances in computer graphics and filmmaking techniques, movies continue to become more unrealistic.", "A barely coherent story lightly disguised by big explosions and CGI.", "The story is convoluted, and by turns attempts to be a tent pole action film, a buddy comedy, a family melodrama, a revisionist western, and a tale of heroism, and it falls flat in every instance.", "Only two words come to mind. Why bother?", "'Hi-Yo, Silver, Away!' And sadly, that's what you may be doing -- going away...", "Good news, Washington Redskins! For one glorious weekend in the summer of 2013, your unapologetically racist franchise is not the most grotesque pop culture representation of Native Americans!", "The philosophy behind the movie, which stretches to two-and-a-half hours, seems to be the same one that inspired the all-you-can-eat Vegas buffet.", "Often patently ridiculous, with plenty of outrageous stunts and off the wall humor, but that's part of its singular charm.", "It's just dreadful and a failed attempt at a franchise that needs to ride off into the sunset and be forgotten forever.", "The overlong plot lacks smarts; the action (a train wreck aside) lacks thrills; and the cascade of characters (including turns from Helena Bonham Carter and Tom Wilkinson) lack the necessary depth or spark.", "The Lone Ranger has its good moments, but it has many more that just don't come together into a cohesive whole.", "This movie is almost condescending in its lack of concern for logic, continuity and charm.", "An altogether enjoyable summer entertainment that manages, in its own way, to hearken back to those thrilling days of yesteryear.", "In spite of the length, it's still an enjoyable watch filled with more laughs than expected, or is probably appropriate for the genre.", "It certainly isn't perfect, but give The Lone Ranger a chance if you're in the mood for some old-fashioned western adventure fun.", "The Lone Ranger is a film that manages to be bad in many ordinary ways and, also, to be bad in a rather extraordinary way.", "The Lone Ranger wasn't the best film I've seen this summer, but it is far from the worst. I would gladly recommend this, but be cautious of the overtly violent nature.", "Has its heart in some of the right places, but just can't shoot straight.", "In any case, by the time you stagger out of this endless nightmare, you will feel as aged and destroyed as Johnny Depp in his old-man makeup.", "There are so many wild and funny ideas.
