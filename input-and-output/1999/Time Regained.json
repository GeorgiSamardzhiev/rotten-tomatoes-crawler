{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The film begins in 1922; Marcel Proust is on his deathbed. Looking through photographs, he reflects on his past, recalling his life and the people he has known and loved. Gradually, the memories of his life are supplanted by the memories of the characters in his novels, and soon, fiction overwhelms reality. The happy days and lost paradise of his childhood alternate with more recent memories of his social and literary life.", "rating": "71", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "2h 38m", "director": "Raoul Ruiz", "studio": "BluCinematografica,France2Cinema,BluFilm,CentreNationaldelaCinematographie,LesFilmsduLendemain,LeStudioCanal+,G\u00e9miniFilms,MadragoaFilmes", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 1, 2019", "box_office": "$467.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Ruiz's surreal, allusive approach weaves together more of the novel's themes and plot strands than you would have thought possible.
