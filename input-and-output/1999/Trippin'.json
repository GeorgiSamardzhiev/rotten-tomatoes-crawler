{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A high-school senior, Gregory Reed (Deon Richmond) is unprepared for life after graduation. Obsessed with finding a girlfriend, Gregory often has elaborate fantasies where he imagines himself as a successful ladies' man. While Gregory passes the time with his slick, trouble-seeking friend, June (Donald Adeosun Faison), he can't seem to escape his rut until he meets the pretty and brainy Cinny (Maia Campbell). Although his crush already has a boyfriend, Gregory is intent on winning her over.", "rating": "18", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 34m", "director": "David Raynr", "studio": "BeaconCommunications", "theater_date": "May 12, 1999", "dvd_date": "May 2, 2017", "box_office": "$9.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Intermittently funny and good-natured, Trippin' won't disappoint its target audience.", "A disjointed, lowbrow comedy about a teen coping with his uncertain future through daydreams.", "The messages, in other words, are mixed -- which makes them pretty much consistent with the perspective of a hormone-driven 17-year-old boy. Viewed in that context, Trippin' doesn't fall quite so far.", "Swirl together a pious message movie, a silly high-school yuck-fest and a raunchy, booty-shaking comedy, and this picture is the infelicitous result.", "As the credits roll into oblivion, James Thurber's ghost puts out his cigarette. There's another movie he could've written!", "Some funny moments and the likeability of Richmond's character make it a tolerable way to pass time, despite the fact (aside from Richmond's fantasies) we've seen everything here many times before.", "An after-school special posing as Booty Call, stumbling badly over its clunky message-movie scripting.", "There are stray sparks of satiric wildness shooting out from this preachy teen message movie.", "As formulaic as it sounds.", "This recklessly constructed mix of social messages, sexual fantasies and street profanity certainly won't be accused of trying to preach to the choir.", "The pliant-featured Richmond is an agreeable, comically adept lead.", "The star's winning smile is the only redeeming quality of this atrocious, predictable teen comedy.", "", "The teen comedy 'Trippin' features a clever technique, but it's trapped inside a stock premise that was exhausted years ago. At best, it would make a nice pilot for a TV sitcom.", "What might have been funny and endearing is instead just more self-inflicted negative stereotypes and marginalizing images.", "", "A few of the daydream sequences are uproarious, but Trippin' tries to get real too late in the game.", "If you want to see an entertaining black high school movie, rent House Party or Cooley High, both funny and intelligent takes on the subject. I'm sure they both took more than a week to write.", "As it is, Trippin' is serviceable as an undemanding date movie.", ""], "rating": ["", "1.5/4", "", "2/4", "3/5", "2/5", "", "C", "2/4", "2/5", "", "1/4", "2/4", "", "", "D", "", "", "", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Nathan Rabin", "Robert Dominguez", "Todd Anthony", "Maitland McDonagh", "Dayana Stetco", "Keith Bailey", "Rod Dreher", "Owen Gleiberman", "Michael Dequina", "Mark Halverson", "Dennis Harvey", "Jeanne Aufmuth", "", "Jeff Strickler", "Tim Cogshell", "Paula Nechak", "Tom Meek", "Dak", "Gene Seymour", "Susan Stark"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro Times (Detroit, MI)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieReport.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sacramento News &amp; Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Palo Alto Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Globe and Mail", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Minneapolis Star Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boxoffice Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Post-Intelligencer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Phoenix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">culturevulture.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Detroit News"], "date": ["July 28, 2014", "July 28, 2014", "July 28, 2014", "July 28, 2014", "July 28, 2014", "July 28, 2014", "July 28, 2014", "September 7, 2011", "November 15, 2009", "August 7, 2008", "June 19, 2008", "May 14, 2003", "April 25, 2003", "November 6, 2002", "June 5, 2002", "April 3, 2002", "March 24, 2002", "February 14, 2001", "February 14, 2001", "January 1, 2000"]}}
