The laughs are well earned, but the attempts at serious romantic analysis fall short of poignancy.", "The young actresses Graham and Wagner here create two characters who feel whole, distinct and weighty.", "An edgy, gabby, salaciously subversive sex farce.", "You gotta admire a director who can come up with a way to hang out in such luxurious digs for two weeks, acting out sexual situations with three of the dishiest young actors in the business.", "A lively, if slender, perpetuation of the battle between the sexes on a modern battleground.", "Built around a fearless performance by the protean Robert Downey Jr., this deliberately provocative story of deception and sexuality packs a punch that's undermined by the director's indulgence.", "Writer-director James Toback must believe his audience is hopelessly prudish if he thinks this pedantic story, which takes place over several hours in a Manhattan loft, is provocative.", "Toback has somehow managed to prolong and expand this sketchy egg-on-your-face situation with a series of unexpected ironies and power role reversals that are not without wit, humor and intelligence.", "A thoroughly engrossing, intelligent and enjoyable experience.", "", "There is little realistic feel to the characters, as drawn by Tobak.", "Mildly entertaining.
