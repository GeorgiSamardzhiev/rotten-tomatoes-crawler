{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When President Ulysses S. Grant (Kevin Kline) learns that diabolical inventor Dr. Arliss Loveless (Kenneth Branagh) is planning to assassinate him, he orders Civil War hero James West (Will Smith) and U.S. Marshal Artemus Gordon (also Kline) to arrest him. West's trigger-happy personality doesn't always mesh well with that of the thoughtful Gordon, but they manage to work together. And with the help of a mysterious stranger (Salma Hayek), West and Gordon close in on Loveless.", "rating": "17", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Western", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Barry Sonnenfeld", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,SonnenfeldJosephsonWorldwideEnt.,PetersEntertainment", "theater_date": "Jun 30, 1999", "dvd_date": "Jun 1, 2009", "box_office": "$113.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A god awful committee made action film that falls apart at the seams by every passing minute.", "The movie is exhausting, utterly without feeling, and pointless -- though Smith looks great in his Western outfit.", "The result? A cautionary tale about boys and their toys and what happens when a star, Will Smith, and a director, Barry Sonnenfeld, are given way too much money to play with.", "Wild, Wild West poses this not very pressing question: Can a comedy costing something north of $100 million hope to succeed solely on the basis of special effects, cross-dressing and a vertically challenged villain?", "In the tradition of such unwatchable blockbusters as Armageddon, Con Air, and Godzilla comes Wild Wild West, yet another cinematic Spruce Goose that illustrates how bigger is rarely better.", "Unfortunately, Smith's abundant charm is squandered by making him play second fiddle to a bunch of dumb machines that look like rejected maquettes from a Star Wars brainstorming session.", "For maximum entertainment, a movie can't afford to waste so much time being its own carnival barker, relentlessly trying to drum up interest.", "For pure summer escapism, you could do far worse.", "It's exasperating. Best to give a miss to a movie whose title should be Mild, Mild Zest, or just Failed, Failed Jest.", "A Smith blockbuster is as much a Fourth of July tradition as parades, barbecue picnics and patriotic speeches, but Wild Wild West is a wet firecracker.", "Bolstered by a subtly funny supporting turn by Kevin Kline and a scenery-chewing performance by Kenneth Branagh, Smith carries the movie with his signature ease.", "Forget all the ruinously expensive special effects. They're not worth a minute of your time, much less two hours of mind-boggling mediocrity.", "[Wild Wild West] is this year's Godzilla, Avengers and Spice World all rolled into one. It's the disappointment of the summer, the worst TV adaptation in recent memory and, almost needless to say, a fiasco of cosmic proportions.", "It will probably make buckets of money, but as this summer's action movie, Wild Wild West only gets mild.", "The Curse of the Recycled TV Series strikes again as director Barry Sonnenfeld manages to transform a mildly amusing mid-'60s TV show into a bloated big-screen bore.", "The script is remorselessly smutty, the one-liners are below average and the giant mechanical spider climax endlessly drawn out, but the wildly inventive gizmos give entertainment value and draw a shield over the numerous flaws.", "A hundred or so minutes of missable anti-entertainment.", "Wild Wild West might once have had aspirations of becoming a grand Hollywood entertainment. Along the way, though, it turned into something far more routine, a slick and predictable piece of moviemaking that's ultimately routine and humdrum.", "Those expecting the quick wit and inventiveness of the television series will certainly be disappointed, as will those who expect the hip suavity that one usually gets from any performance by Will Smith.", "Handcuffed to this blockbuster of all blockbusters and sprawled in our reclining seats, we pass the time counting familiar scenes from other movies."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "2/4", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "2/5", "2/5", "", "", "2.5/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Terrence Rafferty", "Paul Clinton (CNN.com)", "Richard Schickel", "Nathan Rabin", "Michael O&#39;Sullivan", "Jami Bernard", "Matt Soergel", "Peter Bradshaw", "Desmond Ryan", "Ann Hornaday", "Andrew Sarris", "Jay Boyar", "Sharon Pian Chan", "Leah Rozen", "Alan Jones", "", "Philip Booth", "Hal Hinson", "Dayana Stetco"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNN.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Florida Times-Union", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Observer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro Times (Detroit, MI)"], "date": ["April 23, 2017", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 16, 2014", "June 16, 2014"]}}
