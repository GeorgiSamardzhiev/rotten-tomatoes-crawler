{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Set in 1973, it chronicles the funny and often poignant coming of age of 15-year-old William, an unabashed music fan who is inspired by the seminal bands of the time.

Music isn't about cocaine and long hair, free love and road trips... it's about a feeling.", "...Almost Famous will stand the test of time.", "Romance, rock and heartbreak ensue. The incredible cast also includes Philip Seymour Hoffman...", "In Almost Famous, writer-director Crowe is still contending with the dueling voices in his head, and he still can't bring himself to take the harsh road. His movie gives off the warm glow of mercy.", "Cameron Crowe's thinly fictionalized autobiography is deftly poised between rosy affection, thoughtful remembrance, and giddy adolescent awe. As perhaps it should be.", "For every scene that's a sturdy piece of observed wisdom about coming of age... there's another that's pure cheese.", "The film itself -- a quasi-autobiography of writer-director Cameron Crowe -- is still good, but not as good as it seemed 14 years ago.", "will satisfy many music fans for its honest portrayal of the rock-band life", "...funny, joyous, touching, and moving...a very personal film and a most-universal one combined.", "Great, but lots of sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll.", "Director Cameron Crowe won the Original Screenplay Oscar for his warmly nostalgic, often sharply observed memoir of his early days as a music journalist", "Whether disappointed or elated, Cameron Crowe's observations are trenchant. Instinct is the greatest asset as idols let you down. That first gulp of passion in a profession can quench you for years. Quite often, bassists and drummers have little to say.", "It's a world of brotherhood, groupies, the bright spotlight of fame, and the bitterness of business, packaged into a gushing, intuitive valentine from Crowe to his former magical life.", "Cameron Crowe has a knack for making contagious movies that pull audiences into a whirlpool of situations that make you feel impossibly cool because his characters aren't near as cool as their surroundings imply.", "A great love letter to classic rock...", "", "", "The movie's so clever and endearing, you can forget the almost.", "Easily the best film on Crowe's already impressive roster.", "The film's charm owes far more to its creator's brilliant writing than to his anonymous direction."], "rating": ["4/5", "5/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "7/10", "4.5/5", "B", "8/10", "5/5", "B+", "4/4", "A", "A", "", "2/4", "B+", "", "5/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Amelia Harvey", "Danielle Solzman", "Tom Meek", "David Ansen", "Sean Axmaker", "Tim Brayton", "Ken Hanke", "John A.
