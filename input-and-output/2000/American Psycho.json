{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In New York City in 1987, a handsome, young urban professional, Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), lives a second life as a gruesome serial killer by night. The cast is filled by the detective (Willem Dafoe), the fiance (Reese Witherspoon), the mistress (Samantha Mathis), the coworker (Jared Leto), and the secretary (Chlo\u00eb Sevigny). This is a biting, wry comedy examining the elements that make a man a monster.", "rating": "70", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Mary Harron", "studio": "P.P.S.Films,LionsGateEntertainment,EdwardR.PressmanFilmCorp.,MuseProductions,QuadraEntertainment", "theater_date": "Apr 14, 2000", "dvd_date": "Dec 15, 2015", "box_office": "$15.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Expertly made and does what it's trying to do very well, but I just can't fully connect with this one.", "American Psycho directly addresses the horror of capitalism, in which other people are just props for the fantasies of men who get wealthier by the second.", "The idea that this is all a fantasy inside Bateman's head is brilliantly realised in his growing realisation that he's been able to get away with all of this in plain sight.", "There are times where this film is satire at its best. It's also horrific, violent and stomach-turning. Christian Bale is incredible in this movie and he commits to making Bateman completely deplorable.", "Graced with a smart, pathos-laden meditation on male competition and the blood-drawing ferocity of a money-centered culture, along with screenwriter Guinevere Turner, Harron does a transformative voodoo on an often repugnant source.", "American Psycho is one of the greatest horror films of all time; with its disturbingly dark comedy, psychotic breakdowns of society and an unnerving look at the obsessive thoughts of a serial killer.", "As far as revelations go, the final twist in American Psycho is more bewildering than earth-shattering, but that's what makes it great.", "I've always found Mary Harron's vision of Bret Easton Ellis's arch satire of '80s greed, excess, and grooming to be a lot funnier than its reputation.", "When you're a white, rich man in American, you can get away with anything. Murder and rape? Go ahead! Commit at will because the world is your oyster.", "Like all great films, \"American Psycho\" is one you can discover something new in regardless of how many times you've seen it.", "A bloody, gruesome black comedy that's not for kids.", "A brave adaptation of a bracing book.", "The slick satire cleverly equates materialism, narcissism, misogyny, and classism with homicide, but you may laugh so loud at the protagonist that you won't be able to hear yourself laughing with him.", "It's hard to summon up enthusiasm for a performance so rooted in bloody banality. I mean, as Patrick, Bale's most emotionally pressing dilemma is: Chainsaw or butcher knife?", "American Psycho is nearly perfect for what it is, but before we go on, we should ask what that actually amounts to. Can something with so rigid a thesis be a real work of art?", "It needs to be seen and appreciated, like a serpent in a glass cage.", "The movie is elegantly shot, but based on what's on screen, it's hard to tell what motivated Mary Harron to direct this emotionally vapid feature", "Mary Harron asks what's more unnerving - exaggerated, imagined violence or vacuous realities some wish to be real, psychosis as much in the construct as the character. Thus, \"Psycho's\" savagery goes beyond a simple screed against 1980s excess and greed.", "much like the 80's era that it personifies", "Harron' s incisive eye and Bale' s bravura performance carry the day."], "rating": ["3/5", "", "3/5", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "A+", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "", "C+", "4/4", "B", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Trace Thurman", "A.S.
