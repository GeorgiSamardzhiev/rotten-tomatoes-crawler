It is clumsily put together and rather bizarrely played.", "A great movie to eat ice cream to. Brigitte Bardot - WOW!", "Adding up to hardly anything more than a bunch of snapshots of Bardot posturing as a sex kitten in various stages of undress.", "", "A fragilidade do roteiro e o tom de melodrama poderiam transformar este filme em uma experincia nada memorvel - mas  a que a presena incrivelmente sensual e luminosa de Bardot faz a diferena, salvando a produo.", "", "", "More a vestige of 1950s film scandal than a significant work based on its content.", "breezy and enjoyable-often funny and sometimes even a little sad", "The story line is so slight it is forever in danger of wafting away on the Mediterranean breeze.
