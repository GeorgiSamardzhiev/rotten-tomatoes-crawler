{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A blistering satire of network television's pitfalls and prejudices, a humorous look at how race, ratings and the pursuit of power lead to a television writer's stunning rise and tragic downfall. Pierre Delacroix, a young, Harvard-educated man, who is the sole person of color, writing for an upstart network with floundering ratings. Despite several attempts, Delacroix has yet to see any of his concepts go into production.", "rating": "52", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Television", "runtime": "2h 15m", "director": "Spike Lee", "studio": "40Acres&amp;AMuleFilmworks", "theater_date": "Oct 20, 2000", "dvd_date": "Dec 6, 2020", "box_office": "$2.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The initial shock of Bamboozled's blackface revival gives way to melancholic revelation, conjured from the history of cinema.", "As Nicolas Roeg wrote in his 2013 memoir The World is Ever Changing, \"You should make films for the future -- if you do that, the audience will catch up with you, eventually.\" Lee made a film which touches on the past, present and future.", "It works overtime to throw the audience off balance, to alienate us in almost Brechtian fashion, holding us at arm's length but demanding our attention as if saying \"don't look away, you need to see this.\"", "Audacious, vibrant, unsurprisingly maligned but frequently brilliant.", "Believe it or not, Bamboozled is a comedy, even if a dark one. Lee makes sure that there are plenty of laughs, even if he's poking the audience at the same time to wonder why they are laughing.", "Bamboozled is both outrageous and outraged, with some bitter laughs strewn throughout. But the final act is ugly and unconvincing.", "It may not be very subtle but it is very funny, confrontational and thought-provoking throughout.", "Bamboozled does more to really hit audiences in the face with challenging messages, and a specific look that certainly seems untraditional.", "Spike Lee's sharp, riotous satire, from 2000, zeroes in on the grotesque misrepresentation of blacks in American media-and their underrepresentation in the corporate offices that control it.", "Provocative Spike Lee movie for older teens.", "Lee, in his least commercial film, shoots for controversy but loses focus.", "This is basically sloppy, all-over-the-map filmmaking with few hints of self-criticism and few genuine laughs.", "Spike Lee's shotgun attack on the treatment of blacks in television and the blurring of image and identity is a brilliant rant that digresses into repetitive sermonizing.", "A particularly painful mess, because it begins so well and has such promise.", "If Mr. Lee meant to bring back blackface entertainment as a metaphor for the current black performers he finds obnoxious, he has miscalculated.", "...where most of us in his audience will lean forward to hear a whisper, we turn away from a shout. Oh, how Bamboozled shouts.", "Lee's satire on American TV is an intriguing failure.", "The director's new masterpiece is a summation of nearly everything he has learned as a filmmaker, and about black culture, but he doesn't feel the need to beat the audience over the head for each lesson he's trying to impart.", "a sharp-edged, if somewhat heavy-handed, satire about popular culture and the portrayals of blacks in the mass media", "He hammers his point home until the viewer is emotionally beaten into submission and manipulated into a consenting stance."], "rating": ["", "4.5/5", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "2.5/4", "", "8/10", "", "4/5", "C", "", "3/5", "2/5", "", "", "", "4.5/5", "3/4", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["A.S.
