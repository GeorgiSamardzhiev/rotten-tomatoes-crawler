{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1765, under the command of the new Burmese king, an army of warriors sets out to attack Ayutthaya, the previous capital of Thailand. However, while en route, the army faces a challenge they'd never anticipated in the village of Bang Rajan, where men and women take up arms against the invaders. Nai Than (Chumphorn Thepphithak) emerges as the leader in battle, but after he's injured, Nai Jan (Jaran Ngamdee) steps up to take control, while the other villagers contribute to the effort.", "rating": "71", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Art House & International/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h 7m", "director": "Tanit Jitnukul", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 8, 2005", "box_office": "$22.8K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The battle scenes are bloody, visceral, and expertly edited.", "The buffalo are big, the battles brutal and bloody in this gritty Thai epic - but unfortunately the characters are too blank to be interesting.", "The acting is facial-expressions- visible-from- 100-feet overdone and the choppy editing makes for awkward storytelling. However, the battle scenes, which make up at least half the movie, are killer.", "It's far too bloody for the art house crowd and too leisurely paced and obscure for more general audiences.", "Jitnukul can direct action, and every slice of the blade, thwack of the arrow and the glistening of sweat on near-naked bodies makes Bang Rajan a mostly pleasurable diversion.", "From the first battle to the heartrending climax, you will emerge feeling dirty and scarred.", "It's a humid, rough-edged epic that occasionally finds startling beauty amid devastating carnage.", "The thuddingly blunt epic is obvious and intermittently clumsy... yet winning in its own charmingly naive right.", "At two hours, it tests the stamina of even the most ardent action movie fan.", "Jitnukul serves up heaping plates of history and entertainment with this tremendously exciting epic set on the eve of Bangkok's destruction by Burmese forces.", "Features scrumptious-looking jungle battles, with a cast of thousands -- not to mention elephants and water buffalo.", "While co-writer/director Tanit Jitnukul's vision is unapologetically graphic and slightly marred by an artistic awkwardness, this is a rare and worthwhile glimpse into another nation's historical legend.", "Plucked from its cultural context, Bang Rajan is being offered to American audiences as another example of Asian extreme action movies, and gore hounds will find it gratifyingly full of spurting blood and flying limbs.", "The story suggests a more violent Seven Samurai, full of jungle mayhem and eloquently filmed action-movie suspense.", "It becomes, after a while, little more than a mind-numbing bloodbath.", "Even without deep knowledge of Thai politics and history, fans of war pictures will be impressed by Jitnukul's achievement in creating a detailed and graphic, if overheated, account of this ultimate underdog story.", "The noncombative scenes can be melodramatic and broadly acted, but that doesn't rob the movie of a certain inherent power.", "", "Yes, Bang Rajan introduces Westerners to a slice of history worth noting, but its stirring lesson is told in a way that's too long, too brutal, and too clunky to recommend enthusiastically.", "The dramatic ploy is so disjointing, it's not often clear if Jitnukul's narrative is in the past or present."], "rating": ["", "", "2/4", "", "2/4", "", "3/4", "B-", "", "3/5", "3/4", "3/4", "2/5", "3/4", "", "", "B-", "3/4", "2/4", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["J.
