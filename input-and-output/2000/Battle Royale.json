{"metadata": {"synopsis": "42 9th graders are sent to a deserted island. They are given a map, food, and various weapons. An explosive collar is fitted around their neck. If they break a rule, the collar explodes. Their mission: kill each other and be the last one standing. The last survivor is allowed to leave the island. If there is more than one survivor, the collars explode and kill them all.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Art House & International/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "Kinji Fukasaku", "studio": "BattleRoyaleProd.Committee", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The last half hour is the most successful, a final interlude of generational warfare, then radical anonymous freedom.", "Battle Royale is above all a high-concept, action black comedy. Beat Takeshi's performance as Teacher Kitano is one for the record books...", "Not a face value film, it leaves its audience questioning, reflecting, and debating its hauntingly resonant implications.", "You would never suspect that a 70-year-old man made this film: it positively hums with youthful lust and rage.", "This savage social satire revels in the brutality and gore and plays it for dark comedy and gallows humor, a teen melodrama gone feral as cliques fall apart under fire and young love is literally under the gun.", "Before The Hunger Games there was Battle Royale. The bloody spectacle of Japanese schoolchildren being forced into a sadistic game of \"last man standing\" packs an emotional wallop.", "A gloriously entertaining ride, provided you have a taste for dark material and don't mind the occasional poke in the ribs.", "Stylistically it's a beauty, with khaki-uniformed waifs fighting for their lives to a crashing classical score.", "Awful deaths (and hysterical reactions to them) punctuate declarations of love and friendship, revelations of treachery and heavily armed expressions of angst.", "Forgive the film its small flaws of histrionic performances and cheap execution for the giddy rush of its banal, Verhoevenesque atmosphere...", "It may suit a certain worldview, but Battle Royale's cynicism is still a form fantasy-a balm as well as a bomb.", "A wonderfully exciting, incredibly idiosyncratic actioner.", "3D conversion of a classic teen massacre thriller raises the gore level.", "Maybe Battle Royale's ultimate punchline is its inexplicable ability to fool some people into taking it seriously.", "Battle Royale's dystopia reflects a hyper-tech Japan still deeply concerned with social cohesion and the value-gaps between the generations. It's the disturbingly dark social frame, not its bloody canvas, that makes this a battle worth watching.", "Fukasaku's set pieces are dynamic, composed and edited with a neatness that is missing from the shaky-camera esthetic of the movie's successor, 'The Hunger Games.'", "Battle Royale is a masterpiece of mayhem, violence and unfettered teen melodrama.", "Battle Royale is The Hunger Games not diluted for young audiences.", "Pitched with the insatiable verve of a TV game show and the vacant regret of a Grand Theft Auto videogame.", "It gets no points for subtlety, but this confronting, devastating, hilarious and extremely fun film is a masterpiece all in its own right."], "rating": ["", "", "3.5/4", "9/10", "", "", "A", "3/4", "3.5/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "", "1.5/4", "", "4/4", "8/10", "3/4", "B+", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["A.S.
