{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A richly imagined journey into the life and writings of brilliant Cuban author and exile Reinaldo Arenas. It spans the whole of Arenas' life, from his rural childhood and his early embrace of the Revolution to the persecution he would later experience as a writer and homosexual in Castro's Cuba; from his departure from Cuba in the Mariel Harbor exodus of 1980 to his exile and death in the United States.", "rating": "73", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 12m", "director": "Julian Schnabel", "studio": "ElMarPictures,GrandviewPictures", "theater_date": "Jan 26, 2001", "dvd_date": "Mar 1, 2011", "box_office": "$4.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This could have been a compelling movie about a wonderful writer, but instead it's a tedious, pointless mess. After spending over 2 hours with Arenas, I still knew nothing about him. Javier Bardem's great performance seemed to be a complete waste.", "One of the first features about Castro's impact on artists and homosexuals, this biopic is well acted by Bardem", "\"Before Night Falls\" exuberantly portrays a writer whose legacy remains an acutely observant childhood spirit that no perversion of politics could break. Javier Bardem blends the swagger of Robert Downey Jr. and the brooding of a young Al Pacino.", "", "Schabel's most recent work fails to move me. While the story of Reinaldo Arenas is tragic enough to be interesting (and Javier Bardem's performance sympathetic) the film as a whole simply seems long and indulgent.", "", "", "despite a real commitment to Arenas and his work, the film just falls short.", "", "", "Saddled with a wandering opening and an equally listless conclusion, a more fitting name for this two hour-plus biopic might well be Before Night Falters.", "The cinematography is beautiful and clearly shows the director's artistic bent, but the storytelling is often disjointed. . . . Ultimately, Before Night Falls is more successful as a Javier Bardem showcase than a movie.", "[Bardem] simply does what the script calls for him to do, which is basically sustain a look of pain for two-hours plus.", "", "There is something genuinely moving in Bardem's Rabelaisian poet...", "Great performances...boring movie.", "no one can say Schnabel doesn't know how to create a marvelous shot when he wants to. Telling a cohesive story, however, is a skill he has yet to master.", "", "Un cri de coeur...Julian Schnabel's latest work can only be described as one of those soul-stirring cries.", "Some may find Before Night Falls boring because of its episodic nature and its lack of a single, overriding plot. But Before Night Falls has some great qualities."], "rating": ["1.5/4", "B", "4/4", "2/5", "C+", "2.5/5", "2.5/5", "2.5/4", "3/4", "4.5/5", "C-", "2.5/4", "2/4", "3/5", "A", "", "", "3/4", "A", "3/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Austin Kennedy", "Emanuel Levy", "Nick Rogers", "Jim Lane", "Jason Gorber", "", "", "Jeffrey M.
