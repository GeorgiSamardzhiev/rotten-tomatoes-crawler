It's closer to a scary dream than a true nightmare.", "A biblical \"thriller\" so predictable and preposterous that everyone involved should be banished to the confessional for their sins.", "This mystical saga of good versus evil gets a very low grade for originality, packing in as it does too many of the same acrane-mysterioso bits of religious imagery, moody thriller gimmicks and climactic machismo antics as the earlier films.", "It's all utter nonsense, but entertaining in a daft sort of way, though Christina Ricci is shamefully wasted in an irrelevent supporting role.", "I don't know if I'm getting more squeamish, or simply less charitable at being exploitatively manipulated and taken for a moron: possibly both. But I think others will share my disgust at several scenes in Bless The Child.", "Bless The Child pulls every cheap cinematic trick possible to try and put the willies into its punters and, unsurprisingly, fails.", "A sloppy, silly, and sometimes ludicrous movie perpetually haunted by the specter of what it could have been.", "An excruciatingly silly script, clunky editing, and an overbearing orchestral score help make Bless the Child something to avoid at all costs.", "This adaptation of Cathy Cash Spellman's novel is pulp fiction with airs, and director Chuck Russell builds absolutely no suspense.", "A pox on the house of all involved.", "By turns lurid, risible and offensive.", "If you're so inclined, pray that the responsible parties crawl back into whatever hole they emerged from.", "Should have sold its soul for a little help in the script department.", "A supernatural thriller that does for its genre what Battlefield Earth did for science fiction.", "Often trite and predictable but grudgingly likable in the end.", "Director Chuck Russell also made the infinitely better comedy The Mask. After this, he may want to wear a mask.", "Winning an Oscar has changed Kim Basinger, and not in a good way.", "The special effects are impressive, but the dialogue is an unintentional hoot.", "It reps another disappointing outing from Kim Basinger, who's clearly uninspired by the hack material.", "Horrendous dialogue and horrific directing dominate this thriller, in which Coleman's performance shines by default."], "rating": ["", "1/4", "", "2/5", "", "1/5", "", "0/5", "", "0/5", "1/4", "", "", "", "2/4", "F", "0/4", "1/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Louis B.
