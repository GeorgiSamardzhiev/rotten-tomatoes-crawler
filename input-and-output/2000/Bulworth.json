{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Jay Bulworth (Warren Beatty), a financially ruined senator, is now disillusioned with politics. The forlorn statesman orders a contract killing -- the target himself -- so his family will be able to collect a fortune from his insurance policy. Facing imminent death, a devil-may-care Bulworth speaks his mind in public, forsaking platitudes for honest but controversial observations. But when he falls in love with a hip young woman (Halle Berry), Bulworth urgently rethinks his impending murder.", "rating": "76", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Warren Beatty", "studio": "TwentiethCenturyFox", "theater_date": "May 15, 1998", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$26.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Beatty is to be congratulated on even attempting to prick America's conscience in these conservative times, but the real reason for seeing it is the panache with which it captures the irresistible flash and filigree of American politics.", "This charming, Capraesque political fable demonstrates the viability of Warren Beatty as writer, director and star; it's his last decent film.", "", "", "Smug but fun political satire for adults only.", "Manages to courageously and seriously address political issues head-on while remaining a funny and entertaining romp.", "A liberal call to action -- a satire driven by equal parts disgust and hope.", "It's a sharp, brave movie, a little ragged around the edges, but that's to its advantage.", "Beatty is a very shielded actor, but he shrewdly finds ways to work within his limitations, and Bulworth is a tour-de-force for him.", "Jaw-droppingly abysmal. Seldom has a major star embarrassed himself so badly.", "While the ending is predictable and unsatisfying, the political issues that the film raises (racism, et. al) are worthy of further discussion.", "one of the hardest-hitting and unblinkingly brave political satires to hit American screens since \"Dr. Strangelove.\"", "A middling funny film with a good, if silly, performance by Warren Beatty, and not much more.", "An effective satire that deserves recommendation.", "Beatty's contribution to the ranks of recent political satire is bold, merciless and frequently very funny, and his performance is just plain fearless.", "sometimes ambitious failures are more interesting to watch than modest successes, and, though \"Bulworth\" may offend... it's unlikely to bore anyone.", "Warren Beatty is wonderfully wacky here.", "", "The plot is clever.
