what lurks and wails behind a wall is, for Haneke, the most reliable wellspring of dread.", "A procession of long virtuoso takes that typically begin and end in the middle of actions or sentences, constituting not only an interactive jigsaw puzzle but a thrilling narrative experiment.", "A searing, structurally ingenious look at racial tension on the streets of Paris.", "Code Unknown is an unusual example of a movie that is socially aware, but that is thankfully equally aware of how tiresome moralising and preaching can be.", "This film, from Austrian director Michael Haneke, is one of the most uncompromisingly difficult and challenging of the year.", "If some of the political theorising is somewhat naive and the direction is occasionally manipulative, the acting, particularly from Juliette Binoche, is superb.", "Haneke brings his usual dark sensibility to bear on the multifaceted story, expressing the fractured quality of modern city life through scenes that wander through a labyrinth of missing links and lost connections.", "With virtually no music and very little expository dialogue, this is one of the rare films with enough faith in moviegoers to let them figure things out for themselves.", "A chilling picture of urban disillusionment, Code Unknown's strength is its insistence that, to be realistic, it cannot give easy answers.", "All this unrelenting bleakness would be fine if it went someplace interesting, but the film's themes never coalesce into anything beyond basic existential angst.", "The director toys with the entire idea of unlocking the code of violence, the small and individually insignificant elements that add up to tales of either joy or horror.", "Michael Haneke's only attempt to be emotionally salient.", "[Haneke's] socio-political condemnations assume an aggressively hectoring tone.", "Despite the film's Bressonian rigours, its emotional force should finally give the lie to Haneke's reputation as a coldly academic film-maker.", "", "The emotional landscape is observed with detachment; you have to connect the almost hidden dots to empathise with the characters or form the message, and it's hard.", "Packed with provocative ideas and fragments of provocative ideas.", "Even if it's a bit 'foreign' and arty, it's also consistently gripping, thoughtful, powerful stuff, assembled in an unusual way that catches us off guard and never preaches."], "rating": ["4/5", "8/10", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "3/4", "3.5/4", "4/5", "", "B", "3/5", "C+", "", "5/5", "", "3/4", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "Valeriy Kolyadych", "Anthony Lane", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Scott Tobias", "Daniel Etherington", "Peter Bradshaw", "David Parkinson", "David Sterritt", "Ken Fox", "", "David Rooney", "Jason Gorber", "Cole Smithey", "Nick Schager", "Geoff Andrew", "Emanuel Levy", "Alexander Walker", "Chris Hewitt", "Rich Cline"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">PopMatters", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Scouts", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lessons of Darkness", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">St. Paul Pioneer Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat"], "date": ["October 20, 2020", "April 22, 2016", "August 27, 2014", "August 27, 2014", "August 27, 2014", "August 27, 2014", "August 27, 2014", "August 27, 2014", "August 27, 2014", "August 27, 2014", "August 27, 2014", "October 18, 2008", "June 21, 2007", "October 5, 2006", "September 7, 2006", "February 9, 2006", "July 19, 2005", "December 15, 2003", "February 14, 2003", "December 31, 2002"]}}
