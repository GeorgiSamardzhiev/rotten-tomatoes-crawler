{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Selma is a Czech immigrant, a single mother working in a factory in rural America. Her salvation is passion for music, specifically, the all-singing, all-dancing numbers found in classic Hollywood musicals. Selma harbors a sad secret: she is losing her eyesight and her son Gene stands to suffer the same fate if she can't put away enough money to secure him an operation. When a desperate neighbor falsely accuses Selma of stealing his savings, the drama of her life escalates to a tragic finale.", "rating": "69", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "2h 20m", "director": "Lars von Trier", "studio": "IcelandicFilmCorporation,FilmFour,TrustFilm,ConstantinFilmProduktion,BlindSpotPicturesOy,CinematographA/S,WhatElse?B.V.,Yleisradio,DanmarksRadio,Arte,ZentropaEntertainments,TV1000,LiberatorProductions,LantiaCinema,SVTDrama,AngelFilmsA/S,Canal+,FilmiV\u00e4st,WestdeutscherRundfunk,VPROTelevision,ArteFranceCinema,France3Cin\u00e9ma", "theater_date": "Oct 6, 2000", "dvd_date": "Jun 27, 2016", "box_office": "$4.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Dancer in the Dark critiques the relentless optimism of mid-century movie musicals, but it also puts the American cultural narrative under the microscope.", "Von Trier infamously harassed Bj\u00f6rk while making this film, yet its power, insight, and prescience, unpleasant and hard to take, are undiminished...", "Bj\u00f6rk plays Selma, a Czech immigrant suffering from a degenerative eye disorder. It's a rare, hereditary disease, and it'll steal her sight but not the song in her heart.", "A sweeping denunciation of the myth of the American dream-the idealized America put forth by escapist Hollywood fare.", "Dancer is like no other movie around. Shot in bleached-out video colors in rough, hand-held style, the film is at once aggressively modern and deliberately, melodramatically, old-fashioned.", "", "Denmark's enfant terrible Lars von Trier finally won the Camme Palme d'Or for this postmodern deconstructive musical featuring a stunning performance by Bjork.", "Habitually galling director Lars von Trier's musical is a black-swan genre rarity - a 1960s-set sledgehammer to Broadway and Hollywood's insistence on sunshiny endings in golden-era musicals about Nazis, murder and suicide.", "Everything about Bjork and Dancer in the Dark is enigmatic in an uncomfortable dissecting way that shows beauty in the crudest way, and crudeness in the complexity of advanced social mores.", "", "It is not pleasing to watch, by any conceivable definition of that word.", "Even without the musical numbers, von Trier has given us a compelling story with original characters.", "", "", "", "I was devastated by it.
