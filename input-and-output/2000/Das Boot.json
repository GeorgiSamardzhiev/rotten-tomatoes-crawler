While war correspondent Werner (Herbert Gr\u00f6nemeyer) observes day-to-day life aboard the U-boat, the grizzled captain (J\u00fcrgen Prochnow) struggles to maintain his own motivation as he attempts to keep the ship's morale up in the face of fierce battles, intense storms and dwindling supplies.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 30m", "director": "Wolfgang Petersen", "studio": "BavariaFilm,WestdeutscherRundfunk,RadiantProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 1, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["For all its intensity and excitement and fighting and destruction is, perhaps more than any other film, an anti-war film.", "Das Boot comes across as cold and distant, but the work of Wolfgang Petersen is nevertheless rigorous and skillful, the actors are effective, and the camerawork is risky. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Peterson has captured the teamwork, the claustrophobia and the peril of underwater warfare. He draws compelling performances from the crewmen, many of them quite young.", "Wolfgang Petersen's exceptional anti-war, war film is a long haul but never boring -- as the captain, officers and crew face terror, ennui, excitement and occasional joy in the North Atlantic in 1941. (Director's Cut)", "Das Boot is a psychological thriller of the first order. The fact that the setting is a war is, amazingly and interestingly, only incidental to its points.", "Still makes compulsive viewing.", "Everything described in the film is authentic.", "Gripping and authentic.", "The film has no qualities beyond its formal polish.", "The execution is second to none; taut, claustrophobic and overwhelming.", "Few war films are more potent than Das Boot...the ultimate submarine movie. [Blu-ray]", "It is unlike any other war film in that it confines the audience in a confined submarine where we digest the fear and panic of the human beings on screen. In short, \"Das Boot\" is a religious experience.", "Agripping, impressively detailed account of one harrowing voyage by a German U-boat during World War II.", "Just as good, some say better, than the original classic.", "", "Petersen's shooting style displays a breathtaking, if impersonal and faintly academic, virtuosity comparable to that of Lean or Coppola.", "THE submarine movie.
