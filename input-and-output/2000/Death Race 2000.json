{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the year 2000, America is a totalitarian regime on the brink of collapse. The most popular sport in this dystopia is the Transcontinental Road Race, where teams earn points for logging the fastest time and for mowing over the most innocent pedestrians in the process. This year's competitors include Frankenstein (David Carradine), who is rumored to be more machine than man, and the tough-as-nails \"Machine Gun\" Joe Viterbo (Sylvester Stallone). Some have a plan to stop the race.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 18m", "director": "Paul Bartel", "studio": "NewWorldPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 23, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Director Paul Bartel stretches all of his limited resources into an unexpectedly amusing bit of schlock that, not surprisingly, would become a cult hit.", "I was torn between walking out immediately and staying to witness a spectacle more dismaying than anything on the screen: the way small children were digging gratuitous bloodshed.", "A movie that has a little bit of everything, and it's easily the best version of itself that could possibly be put together.", "A goofy piece of over-the-top mayhem with half a brain.", "A terrifically entertaining movie, and a sharp, funny social commentary from start to finish.", "Roger Corman is the master of doing a lot with a little, and Death Race 2000 is but one shining example of the filmmaker's know-how.", "Director Paul Bartel perfected his brand of blackhearted humor on this ragged production, overcoming budgetary restraint with inspired moments of B movie spectacle...", "Behold the power of cheese!", "The conception and execution are top-notch low-budget trash.", "Death Race 2000 is as Corman as his B-grade action pics come, with cars flying through the frame, blood spilling behind them, and overnight pit-stops for some sex (\"navigators\" in each car keep their drivers juiced up).", "One of King Corman's finest pictures.", "It has a comic strip premise which is neverthless wholly credible in a sick sort of way.", "", "Unwatchable car wreck of an exploitation film.", "Fun, fun, fun!", "The story, about a road race in the not-too-distant future for which the drivers are given points for running down pedestrians, becomes an elaborate and telling fantasy about our peculiar popular entertainments.
