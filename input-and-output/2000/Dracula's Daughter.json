{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Although Count Dracula was destroyed by Van Helsing (Edward Van Sloan), who is now being tried for his murder, Dracula's daughter, the Countess Marya Zaleska (Gloria Holden), is still alive -- and her father's death has brought her no closer to eradicating her vampiric thirst for blood. When attempts to free herself of the disease fail, she turns to psychiatrist Dr. Garth (Otto Kruger) for assistance, but soon finds herself struggling with the desire to make him one of the undead as well.", "rating": "55", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Horror", "runtime": "1h 12m", "director": "Lambert Hillyer", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "Jan 1, 1936", "dvd_date": "May 16, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This 1936 release suffers from the absence of Bela Lugosi and the graceless hand of silent-western director Lambert Hillyer.", "That rare thing, a sequel of true merit.", "Moody, beautifully shot and saturated in an atmosphere of bleak hopelessness.", "Unsatisfying sequel to Dracula.", "Bit of a bore with Count Dracula nowhere in sight. His daughter reluctantly bares her fangs. Can vampires even have children?", "A worthy sequel to Tod Browning's Dracula (1931).", "The shift from Stoker to Le Fanu remains unmistakable", "Dracula's daughter herself is strange and memorable,far better than the tawdry B-movie in which she made her first and last appearance.", "Wildly over-rated.", "Atmospheric, early Universal horror starring Otto Kruger, Gloria Holden.", "Apart from its haunting, low-key mood, the film is also notable for its subtle suggestion (hardly expected from a former director of B Westerns) of the lesbian nature of the female vampire.", "A cute little horror picture. Be sure and bring the kiddies.", "The film is so clumsy and so off the mark that it winds up being a throwaway piece, something for Universal Monster completists only.", "", "Although it is a marked improvement on the original film, it's still a bit of a snooze, relying too much on forced comedy and not enough on suspense or fright.", "On a large budget and high hopes, Dracula's Daughter exceeds expectations with its methodical pacing and oppressive, melancholic tone.", "", "A mournful and somber sequel that is more atmosphere than horror.", "A fine fadeout on the best period the horror genre ever had. That things would never be quite this way again, however, makes it a slightly bittersweet experience.", ""], "rating": ["", "", "3/5", "2/5", "C", "B+", "", "5/10", "", "2/5", "", "", "2/5", "2/5", "3/5", "3.5/4", "3/5", "3/5", "4.5/5", "6"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["J.
