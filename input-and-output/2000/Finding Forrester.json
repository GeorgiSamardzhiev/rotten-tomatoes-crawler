{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A unique relationship develops between an eccentric, reclusive novelist and a young, amazingly gifted scholar-athlete. After the novelist discovers that the young athlete is also an excellent writer and secretly takes him on as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, they develop an unlikely friendship. As they learn more about each other, they learn more about themselves, and ultimately, with the help of his new mentor, the basketball star must choose the right path.", "rating": "74", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 13m", "director": "Gus Van Sant", "studio": "ColumbiaPictures,FountainbridgeFilms,LaurenceMarkProductions", "theater_date": "Dec 19, 2000", "dvd_date": "Dec 13, 2013", "box_office": "$51.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Is Gus Van Sant embarrassed by this film? It's been a reasonable question ever since its first frame flickered on the screen, although it would be an unwarranted response for an imperfect but invigorating inversion of the comforting beats you expect.", "A nicely inspirational affair.", "predictable formula film that is quickly forgotten", "Quality characters, solid film; OK for ages 14+.", "Lost in \"Forrester's\" dismissal is appreciation for its relatively piss-and-vinegar approach to the act of creating fiction. Jazzy, classicist and a bit meta, the film's unexpectedly urbane quirks resemble Jonathan Demme films at their mainstream best.", "Brown, in his acting debut, displays the balance of book smarts, street smarts, and vulnerability that is crucial to the part.", "Doesn't fully live up to all the expectations but is still enjoyable.", "", "", "Rather hollow effort.", "If director Gus Van Sant had always been a hack it wouldn't matter so much, but personally I find this form of licking the audience's cheeks like an obsequious puppy deeply offensive.", "Finding Forrester is almost worth seeing for Connery and Brown, but it's a lot to ask for people to sit through 136 minutes when only about a third of it is any good.", "The leaden screenplay can be fingered for many of the film's faults. But what happened to the off-kilter film-maker last seen at work in To Die For?", "Finding Forrester is not the fastest-paced film in the world, nor the most stirring. It is however the most complete portrait of what it means to be a writer that I've seen in a long time.", "It's a really good movie.", "La cinta es disfrutable aunque uno no sea de color, buen tirador de tiros libres, o buen escritor.", "All signs of intelligent life are sacrificed to Hollywood formula and liberal wish-fulfilment.", "The relationship between Connery and Brown is powerful enough to sustain the story.", "It is a film about intelligence in unlikely places that, paradoxically, requires you to check your brain at the door.", "A pleasant movie we've all seen before."], "rating": ["4/5", "3/5", "C", "4/5", "4/4", "3/4", "", "4/4", "3/5", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "4/5", "3.5/4", "3.5/5", "", "3/4", "C-", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Nick Rogers", "Leigh Paatsch", "John A.
