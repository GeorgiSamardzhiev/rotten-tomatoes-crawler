{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Newcomer Michelle Rodriguez in an astounding performance alongside Jaime Tirelli, Paul Calderon and Santiago Douglas. Nothing comes easy for Diana Guzman, a troubled girl on the brink of womanhood. Her teachers don't understand her, her father underestimates her and her friends are few. Diana struggles to find respect and dignity every day. Diana is a quick tempered young woman who finds discipline, self-respect and love in the most unlikely place -- a boxing ring.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Drama/Sports & Fitness", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Karyn Kusama", "studio": "IndependentFilmChannel,Green/Renzi", "theater_date": "Sep 29, 2000", "dvd_date": "May 13, 2016", "box_office": "$1.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Definitely a glass ceiling breaker, and a fiery breakout performance by Rodriguez.", "Grounded in a precise, unemphatic naturalism.", "Thought-provoking boxing drama has lots of profanity.", "", "It gives its fine actors room to breathe and behave -- and in Michelle Rodriguez's case, glow.", "A bit of a lightweight.", "While parts were new and interesting, I can't make it a recommended view.", "For once, the advance buzz has been amply justified, thanks to an extraordinarily charismatic film debut by a non-professional named Michelle Rodriguez.", "For all the violence on view, Kusama's script insists on a real, wholly unsentimental tenderness.", "It's a refreshingly straightforward and honest attempt, flying in the face of the rest of the product out there, which is either manipulating and dumb or tricky and arty.", "Kusama's direction is imaginative, her attention to detail makes for credibility and clarity with regard to the dilemmas faced by her determined young heroine, and Rodriguez is quite astonishing in the lead role.", "It's obvious Kusama knew what she wanted and was in control, because all the key roles and scenes are played with a uniform tone and conviction.", "It's sensitive, it avoids sentimentalism, and it wins our cheers by giving us believable characters that we care about.", "A moving performance by newcomer Michelle Rodriguez showcases this moody Sundance showstopper about a Brooklyn teen who battles an age-old gender barrier.", "The strength of this Romeo and gym-rat story is Rodriguez's performance. She is a vivid powder keg of repressed and resurrected dreams and desires.", "Like a smart boxer, Girlfight knows when to be light on its feet and when to hit hard.", "While it wonderfully confounds our narrative expectations as a coming-of-age story and a romantic drama, it works on another level as a great sporting experience.", "The script is pure Rocky but the style is Girlz n' the Hood, and the two don't ever mesh.", "A low-key, naturalistic coming-of-age drama.", "First-time writer-director Karyn Kusama makes it seem believable (the big question is, how come someone with this much talent isn't getting more opportunities in Hollywood?)."], "rating": ["3/4", "", "4/5", "3/5", "", "2.5/5", "C", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "B", "B+", "3.5/4", "3/5", "3/4", "4/5", "2.5/4", "4/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tom Meek", "Gavin Smith", "Andrea Beach", "", "Richard Schickel", "James Mottram", "Jason Gorber", "Andrew Sarris", "Matt Wolf", "Jeffrey M.
