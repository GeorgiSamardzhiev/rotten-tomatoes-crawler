{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Disney tackles Greek mythology in this animated feature. Hercules (Tate Donovan), a son of gods, was snatched as a baby by Hades (James Woods) and forced to live among mortals as a half-man, half-god. Now a teenager, Hercules needs to perform a rite of passage on Earth to prove himself worthy of living with the gods on Mount Olympus. With his plucky satyr sidekick, Philoctetes (Danny DeVito), along for the ride, Hercules must learn how to use his strength to defeat a series of evil creatures.", "rating": "84", "genre": "Animation/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Ron Clements, John Musker", "studio": "WaltDisneyPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 13, 2015", "box_office": "$99.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["I guess it's something different from Disney which felt refreshing and it made me laugh.", "Kids will love Hercules.
