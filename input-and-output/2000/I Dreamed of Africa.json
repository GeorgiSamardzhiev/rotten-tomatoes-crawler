{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Inspired by the true story of indomitable Kuki Gallmann, the film tells of a beautiful and inquisitive woman who had the courage to escape from her comfortable yet monotonous life in Italy to start anew in the African wilderness with her son, Emanuele, and her new husband, Paolo. Gallmann faces great danger there but eventually becomes a celebrated conservationist.", "rating": "10", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "Hugh Hudson", "studio": "ColumbiaPictures,Jaffilms", "theater_date": "May 5, 2000", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$6.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["I Dreamed of Africa boasts the majestic landscapes and wildlife that explain why anyone would be spellbound by the place. But the story is fitfully episodic and the jerky editing doesn't help a bit.", "I Dreamed of Africa fails on so many levels that it's hard to even give it credit for the one area in which it excels.", "It's neither epic enough to fulfill a grand scope, nor intimate enough to be an overpowering emotional experience.", "This film, based on a true story, transcends its handsomeness to present a subtle portrait of a woman's growing consciousness.", "In the opening segment of I Dreamed Of Africa, Kim Basinger breaks her leg. The rest of the film is so dull, you can almost hear the bone heal.", "It's very similar in story and theme to Out Of Africa but lacks that film's grandeur and real sense of what makes the heroine love the country.", "Basinger's performance is exceptional. She brings a raw, unselfconscious drive to the role that holds the film together, even while Hudson keeps it hopscotching across time.", "Given contemporary African issues, the film doesn't ring true or do anything beyond skate over a familiar and all-too melodramatic surface.", "Here's hoping your own dreams of Africa are more interesting -- and better acted -- than this movie.", "Director Hugh Hudson gives us a Kenya that is dusty, bleak and generally unappealing. Rarely has a movie about Africa aroused so few feelings of escapism.", "This flawed film carries within it a rich and complex performance from Basinger.", "I Dreamed of Africa is, quite simply, one of the worst mainstream movies ever made.", "Kim Basinger, as Kuki, is attractive and touching, but she's given one unplayable scene after another.", "The narration, presumably from Gallmann's book, must lose something in the translation; in Basinger's solemn readings, it sounds like ersatz greeting-card poetry.", "This astonishingly awful film is a study in how a film can go terribly wrong from concept to execution.", "The movie isn't just bad -- it's frustratingly fragmented.", "Ultimately the movie is alluring and respectful -- its sadness may be what saves it from becoming sensationalist or trite.", "There's some good work from Basinger and solid (but also bland) techs and not too much else.", "A production like this deserves better scriptwriters and a better leading player.", "Shockingly boring and stupifyingly umoving."], "rating": ["2.5/4", "1/5", "2/4", "", "", "", "3/4", "2/5", "1/4", "", "3.5/5", "", "", "2/5", "0/4", "1/4", "", "C+", "2.5/5", "1.5/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Desmond Ryan", "Paula Farmer", "Paul West", "Richard Schickel", "Keith Phipps", "Mike Goodridge", "Jack Mathews", "Lorien Haynes", "Chris Kaltenbach", "George Meyer", "Serena Donadoni", "Glen Oliver", "Joe Morgenstern", "Jim Lane", "Michael Dequina", "David Keyes", "Lisa Alspector", "Robin Clifford", "John R.
