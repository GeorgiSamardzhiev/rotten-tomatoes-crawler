There are few films that understand that simple concept better than Ivansxtc.", "Shot on High Definition video, this exceptionally well-made but exceedingly bleak peek at tinseltown would be unbearable were it not for the sympathetic performance of Danny Huston...", "", "", "", "", "A triumph, relentless and beautiful in its downbeat darkness.", "The fascination comes in the power of the Huston performance, which seems so larger than life and yet so fragile, and in the way the Ivan character accepts the news of his illness so quickly but still finds himself unable to react.", "It's hard to say who might enjoy this, are there Tolstoy groupies out there? It's dark and tragic, and lets the business of the greedy talent agents get in the way of saying something meaningful about facing death", "It gets onto the screen just about as much of the novella as one could reasonably expect, and is engrossing and moving in its own right.", "Huston nails both the glad-handing and the choking sense of hollow despair.", "Captivates as it shows excess in business and pleasure, allowing us to find the small, human moments, and leaving off with a grand whimper.", "(Danny Huston gives) an astounding performance that deftly, gradually reveals a real human soul buried beneath a spellbinding serpent's smirk.", "A committed, intelligent and fascinating piece of work with no irony about it.", "A directorial tour de force by Bernard Rose, ivans xtc. is one of this year's very best pictures.", "A substantial and affecting piece of work.", "A powerful, chilling, and affecting study of one man's dying fall.", "It's \"Bowfinger\" with a meaning, it's \"The Player\" with a heart, it's a window into business, politics and excesses. The film has heart", "A remarkable film by Bernard Rose.", "I have no way of knowing exactly how much is exaggeration, but I've got a creepy feeling that the film is closer to the mark than I want to believe."], "rating": ["4", "", "3/5", "3/5", "B+", "3/5", "B", "3/4", "2.5/5", "B+", "3/5", "3/4", "3.5/4", "4/4", "4/4", "", "4/5", "3/4", "4/4", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Kevin Wight", "David Ehrenstein", "", "Emanuel Levy", "Daniel Kasman", "Andrea Chase", "Tom Sime", "Ian Mantgani", "Cherryl Dawson and Leigh Ann Palone", "Frank Swietek", "Maitland McDonagh", "Jeffrey M.
