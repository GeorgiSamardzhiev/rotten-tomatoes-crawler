{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Set in the early 1970's, \"Jesus' Son\" is a series of linked yet discrete stories that chart the to-hell-and-back journey of a young man known only as \"FH.\" Told in the way a person might recount a series of anecdotes over a drink -- with all the mistakes and exaggerations, false starts and shuttling back in time that inevitably occurs -- it is a stunning glimpse into the way one man's heart and mind work.", "rating": "80", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Alison Maclean", "studio": "AllianceAtlantisCommunications,EvenstarProductions,BlueSkyStudios", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 23, 2016", "box_office": "$1.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Every role in this film is just nailed by its actor...", "Alison Maclean takes an uncommon approach to a common theme and comes up with a film that is nothing short of a revelation.", "Jack Black has become impossible to ignore.", "takes some different turns", "JESUS' SON is bottom of the line trash that wants to be art. Full of self important crap, tedious performances, and embarrassing experimental flourishes, this is a movie to avoid at all costs.", "", "While one is able to get interested in FH's internal workings, it's more difficult to get too invested in his external actions--that is, on rare occasion he does act rather than react.", "", "[J]oyless and empty...", "The film uses dreamlike quality to evoke youth subculture of the 1970s, and Billy Crudup is perfectlt cast as a man who believes he possesses healing powers and wants to do good, but his attempts always end disastrously", "Manages to blend its stories together into a nearly seamless narrative, sliding dreamily from one episode to the next before we even realize we've gone.", "", "Despite the occasional miscalculation and disappointing last half-hour, an estimable piece of work.", "When the film finds a note of bittersweet conclusion, I'm wondering why all these colorful threads remained so loose when they might have woven into an interesting story.", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "", "B", "", "B+", "2.5/4", "4/5", "", "B", "2.5/4", "4/5", "B", "C", "4/5", "2/4", "4/5", "C+", "2.5/4", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["A.S.
