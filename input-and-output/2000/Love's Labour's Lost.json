{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Kenneth Branagh continues to make sterling adaptations of classic William Shakespeare plays with this romantic musical-comedy. \"Love's Labour's Lost\" takes place in 1939, when the King of Navarre and his three best friends make a pact to remain celibate for three years. When the Princess of France arrives with her three beautiful companions, their will, and honor, is put to the test immediately.", "rating": "49", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts/Romance", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Kenneth Branagh", "studio": "ShakespeareFilmCompany,LeStudioCanal+,MiramaxFilms,IntermediaFilms,Path\u00e9Pictures,ArtsCouncilofEngland", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 8, 2016", "box_office": "$284.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Broad and wildly uneven, this Labour teeters on the edge of the amateur.
