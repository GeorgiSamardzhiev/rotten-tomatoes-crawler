{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Ex-outlaw Link Jones (Gary Cooper) is aboard a train when it is robbed by bandits. When he tries to intervene, he's knocked out and left in the middle of nowhere with saloon singer Billie (Julie London), whom he hoped to hire as a schoolteacher in his town, and Sam (Arthur O'Connell), a con man. Link brings the three to his nearby former home, now the hideout for the bandits, who are led by his uncle (Lee J. Cobb) -- and to save his new friends, he must rejoin the old gang for one last holdup.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Classics/Western/Romance", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Anthony Mann", "studio": "AshtonProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 20, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One of Mann's most debated works, made up of several key, striking moments that give the production distinct strength.", "A big brutal western, with \"epic\" pretensions, starring Gary Cooper as that much-too-familiar stereotype, the reformed gunfighter who's trying to go straight.", "Mann's direction is immaculate, making Reginald Rose's clearly allegorical, and sometimes forced, screenplay seem even better than it is.", "Anthony Mann's terrific final western is a potent examination of one man's battle against his own darker impulses.", "Cooper gives a characteristically virile performance, his dominance of the outlaws quietly believable, while London achieves some touching and convincing moments in a difficult role.", "Man of the West is a combination of the James Stewart Westerns that came before it and the epic ideas that would drive [Mann's] final few films.", "A superb Western, exemplifying Mann's capacity for integrating his interest in spectacle with a resonant narrative.", "This is a small picture, but it does have a cryptic defiance and an aura of snakelike evil that gets one.", "", "A tour de force for Cooper.", "Mann's last western is a powerful film.", "", "This is perhaps his finest western, a magnificently staged and photographed film -- few directors could match Mann's appreciation of space -- at the centre of which a flawed, neurotic hero struggles to do the right thing.", "This late CinemaScope western by the great Anthony Mann achieves a tragic intensity and a monumental scenic splendor despite some serious handicaps.", "Mann's last western, and his most disturbing foray into the genre."], "rating": ["6/10", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "3.5/4", "A", "5/5", "", "", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Clyde Gilmour", "Derek Malcolm", "Wendy Ide", "Variety Staff", "Jeffrey M.
