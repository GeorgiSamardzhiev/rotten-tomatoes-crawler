{"metadata": {"synopsis": "It's 1979 and Mary (Mariam Parris), an Iranian-American teenager, pursues fun and romance in the New Jersey suburbs. Mary's world is radically transformed, though, when Ali (David Ackert), her fundamentalist Muslim cousin, comes to live with her family at the same time that Americans are taken hostage in Iran. American backlash against Iranians and Ali's disclosure of the family's dark history force Mary to come to terms with her own unique, culturally divided identity.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Ramin Serry", "studio": "CentreStreetProductions,StreetlightFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 13, 2017", "box_office": "$104.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A lovely, intricate coming-of-age portrait set in a cross-cultural context, \"Maryam\" reps a promising debut from Ramin Serry.", "", "Smarter in its message than its execution, this is still a thought-provoking rental.", "", "", "First-time writer-director Serry shows a remarkable gift for storytelling with this moving, effective little film.", "High on melodrama.
