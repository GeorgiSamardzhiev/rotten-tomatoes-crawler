{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Everything that can possibly go wrong for groom-to-be Greg Focker (Ben Stiller) does.

But it confirms that Ben Stiller is the best of today's young practitioners of frustration comedy.", "Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller seem evenly matched, making effective foils.", "Scenes that should have been uproarious are weaker than many of the movie's smaller moments, whose everyday humor isn't specific to the plot or characters.", "Star-driven comedy at times offensive and funny.", "...large swaths of the proceedings feel as though they'd be more at home within a garden-variety sitcom.", "What gives the film its special kick is the match of Stiller and De Niro.", "Nobody plays put-upon quite like Ben Stiller.", "Alas, poor Focker. He can't help himself. And we can't help ourselves from falling about, equally helpless, at this superbly antic movie.", "Packed with cringe-worthy moments from beginning to end, Jay Roach's comedy is for anyone who has ever endured a weekend in the company of potential in-laws.", "Owes about 55 percent of its charm to De Niro, who can be hilarious just sitting there.", "Director Jay Roach of the Austin Powers films keeps the pace brisk, and the script by Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg ably piles the pratfalls ludicrously high.", "Stiller portrays a human accident better than anyone and he definitely knows how to extort laughs and sympathy from his audience", "Contains enough belly-laughs and sly jokes to become one of the bigger crowd-pleasers of the fall.", "Astutely observed, subtly played and consistently hilarious...", "Never before have two such skilled actors been so monstrously squandered in a movie so replete with failed gags and pathetic gaffes.", "A definite must-see that's perfect for a guys' night out or a relaxing date.", "An entertaining little outing, but not something that will stay with me.", "The best American comedy of 2000. It has wit, slapstick and romance -- as well as an improbable comedy team in Robert De Niro and Ben Stiller", "Does the usual Hollywood bit of setting up the gags way in advance so that even a coma patient can spot them.", "As far as one-joke movies go, this one has its guffaws."], "rating": ["", "3/4", "", "3/5", "2/4", "3/4", "2.5/4", "", "", "4/5", "3/4", "3/4", "B", "", "1.5/5", "4.5/5", "B", "", "2/4", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Bob Thomas", "Michael Kleinschrodt", "Lisa Alspector", "Nell Minow", "David Nusair", "Michael Dequina", "David N.
