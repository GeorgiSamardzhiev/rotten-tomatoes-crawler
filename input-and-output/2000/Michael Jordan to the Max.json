{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A phenomenal athlete with a unique combination of grace, power, artistry and improvisation, Jordan single-handedly redefined the image of a superstar athlete as he led the Chicago Bulls to a record six NBA title rings. Perhaps the most-recognizable athlete in the world, he was the top player of his era and may be the best player ever to wear an NBA uniform. The filmmaker offers glimpses of Jordan's early life growing up in North Carolina, his rise to fame and his off-court business moves.", "rating": "67", "genre": "Documentary/Special Interest/Sports & Fitness", "runtime": "46m", "director": "Don Kempf, James D.
