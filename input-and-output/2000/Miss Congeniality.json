{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When a terrorist threatens to bomb the Miss United States pageant, the FBI rushes to find a female agent to go under cover as a contestant. Unfortunately, Gracie is the only female FBI agent who can \"look the part\" despite her complete lack of refinement and femininity.

Those who enjoy a little mindless diversion won't mind getting wet once again.", "It's a likeable comedy with many pratfalls, a couple laugh-out-loud moments, and a deep understanding of pageant superficiality.", "Pleasant and entertaining; for teens and older.", "Its story is far from logical, let alone realistic, yet we laugh and completely buy into the fun.", "", "Bullock's talent for gentle farce is not enough to carry her here; there are only so many times she can get a laugh out of stumbling in her high heels and talking with her mouth full.", "While there may not be many surprises, there's little to dislike either.", "Sandra Bullock (who also produces) takes a lame idea of a script, splashes her considerable allure all over it, and comes away with an amiable, light-hearted holiday charmer.", "Miss Congeniality isn't awful, but it isn't utterly entertaining or incredibly original either, it's just right in the middle.", "Basically, this is like a really bad film from the eighties, that seems to be remade with Sandra Bullock digitally grafted onto the horrible plot.", "Predictably cute and idiotically misleading.", "Convenient bimbo stereotypes, bolstered and magnified.", "No one does this kind of thing better than Bullock, but one wonders for how long she can pull it off. Perhaps for as long as it pays.", "Sandra Bullock is in a class of her own and it's only partly a matter of beauty. Perhaps the larger part is that shining, irresistible personality that lights a room, a runway, a silver screen. She can get you interested in the phone directory.", "Caine may save the movie, but Bullock is the movie. The confection rests on her considerable off-center charm and beauty.", "With this cutesy bit of ick, Sandra Bullock squanders the good will she engendered with her surprisingly complex portrayal of a party girl in rehab in 28 Days.", "Taking a potshot at the beauty pageant industry, Miss Congeniality is entertainment as light as a well-shaped hairdo, fitted out with skin-deep characterizations and a plot that has the all complexity of a G-string bikini.", "The title refers to the Miss America pageant award given to \"the person who was nicest to everyone,\" and this seems perfectly apt for Bullock's winning performance.", "Sandra Bullock gives her regular-gal aura a serious workout in Miss Congeniality as an ugly-duckling FBI agent transformed into a beauty-pageant swan. And, by gum, she pulls it off.", "Like most beauty pageant contestants themselves, Miss Congeniality is all charm and little substance."], "rating": ["2.5/5", "2.5/4", "4/5", "3/4", "2/5", "1/5", "", "3/4", "2/5", "1.5/5", "C-", "1/4", "5/10", "3/4", "", "1/4", "3.5/5", "3/5", "3/4", "2/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Leigh Paatsch", "Carrie Rickey", "Nell Minow", "Michael Dequina", "Gerry Gallo", "Jim Lane", "Derek Adams", "Jeffrey M.
