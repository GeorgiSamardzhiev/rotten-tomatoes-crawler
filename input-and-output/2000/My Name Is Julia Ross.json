{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Unemployed Julia Ross (Nina Foch) spots a job ad for a resident personal secretary, and is hired to work a certain Mrs. Hughes (Dame May Whitty), a widow who requests that she move in with her that very night. Julia leaves her old lodgings immediately to stay with her new employer, only to inexplicably wake up two days later in a mansion overlooking the sea. Even more strangely, Mrs. Hughes and her son, Ralph (George Macready), now insist that she's not Julia Ross but Ralph's wife, Marion.", "rating": "96", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 5m", "director": "Joseph H.

Far from a passive waif, she remains in control of herself throughout.", "[Director Joseph H. Lewis'] approach to this material elevates a B picture to new heights.", "One of the incontestable B movie classics. [Full review in Spanish]", "What My Name is Julia Ross concedes in atmosphere to its forebearer it gains in taut, unfussy storytelling.", "Feels incredibly fresh and immediate today, and terrifying to boot.", "An excellent and extremely efficient take on the gaslight subgenre.", "A remarkable little thriller.", "Seamlessly combines noir with the women's film and gothic suspense tropes.", "Lewis's direction is clean and tight without ever looking shoddy. It feels leisurely and opulent, rather than a quickie from poverty row.", "The tightest 65 minutes of epic gaslighting likely ever put to film... bristling mystery of a woman forced to shed her identity reflects on both women's roles in post-war society and Lewis' own chameleonic talents within B-level filmmaking.", "It's not the most essential of film noirs but nevertheless has much to enjoy, more so as a Gothically-inclined tale of abuse and survival.", "Transformation, whether of theme or person, lies at the heart of Joseph H. Lewis's cinematic identity.", "An unfortunately brief running time (a mere 65 minutes) is the biggest flaw in this nifty thriller that could have benefited from a more generous length.", "A wrong-footing crime drama which holds its audience in a state of perpetual anxiety.", "It may not fit the typical mode of a film noir (no detectives, femme fatales, not an urban setting), but its certainly shot like one and it wastes no time - it's a brisk, thrilling movie.", "... a minor but impressive showpiece: crisply directed, smartly shot, handsomely mounted.", "A calling-card work yet fascinatingly filled with feminist strands", "Joseph H. Lewis directed for pace, and he achieves it all the way.", "Director Lewis, like his script, works to keep us unbalanced.", "Inventive crime thriller full of personal touches and a gripping story."], "rating": ["", "", "4/5", "", "", "3.5/5", "", "", "4/4", "1", "7/10", "", "3/4", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "7", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Lauren Humphries-Brooks", "Leonard Maltin", "Fotogramas Staff", "Shawn Glinis", "Kyle Anderson", "Nicholas Bell", "Austin Trunick", "Michael Barrett", "Jeffrey M.
