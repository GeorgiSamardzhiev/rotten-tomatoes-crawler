{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A cutting-edge, live action/animated action adventure comedy about one white blood cell's (Chris Rock) race against the biological clock to hunt down and destroy a lethal new virus (Laurence Fishburne).

But a lot of the movie is just puns, body humor, jokes...but some of the parts, they do very well with it...", "...one of the smartest, funniest and most eye-popping films of the year.", "Mostly animated PG film has gross-out humor, violence.", "I enjoyed it. It's a fun, dumb and gross comedy that kids will love.", "The plot's so much old rote, and the characters have all the personality of protoplasm; but the anthropomorphising of this microcosmic metropolis is wonderfully imaginative, and the dialogue decidedly spiffy.", "You'll probably find yourself laughing at Bill Murray farting. I did.", "It is funny, original, and even contains a genuine, good-natured theme.", "...the whole thing eventually becomes bogged down in its own plot.", "The ideas are there, hints of genius, but no one ignites them.", "I'd advise attendees of this film to go on an empty stomach, but if you're willing to endure the Farrellys' warped sense of humor and Murray's scratching, squirting, gas-passing antics, Osmosis Jones offers some lighthearted fun.", "The over-riding question with all comedies is 'Are there many laughs in it?' Luckily, the answer is yes - there are lots of great jokes, and not all of the scatological kind.", "The design of this colorful interior metropolis is both clever and biologically correct.", "The animated scenes directed by Piet Kroon and Tom Sito occupy most of the running time and are an imaginative and eyecatching tour of the human body.", "Deserves all the praise showered upon the overrated Shrek.", "", "Leave it to the Farrelly brothers to once again gross us out.", "The script has just enough clever jokes to keep us chuckling, even if it never scales the heights of classic comedy.", "...it's up to the animation to keep us entertained, and those sections turn out to be much too predictable.", "This is the kind of premise you'd expect to be filmed as a five-minute educational video, if at all. But this feature is 95 minutes and never drags.", "While it's certainly not among the best movies of the year, Osmosis Jones is not a film that deserved to end up $60 million dollars in the hole."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "3/5", "2/4", "", "3.5/5", "3/4", "2/4", "2/5", "4/5", "4/5", "2.5/4", "", "3.5/4", "C", "3/4", "3/5", "5/10", "3/4", "7/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Korey Coleman", "Erik Anderson", "Nell Minow", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "", "Chris Gore", "Steven Snyder", "David Nusair", "Kimberley Jones", "John R.
