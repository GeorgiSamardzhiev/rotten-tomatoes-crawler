But this exhilaration is ephemeral-we awaken and realize that the glorious reverie has passed forever. In \"Passion of Mind,\" Marie Willis (Demi Moore) awakens from one dream only to enter another. Or does she? Ultimately, the nocturnal-fantasy that Marie creates becomes so vivid and alluring that even she can't distinguish between the dream and the reality.", "rating": "19", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Alain Berliner", "studio": "LakeshoreEntertainment,RonBassProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 1, 2016", "box_office": "$769.0K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's flawed and a bit convoluted, but worth seeing simply because the idea behind it is so intriguing.", "", "A juicy romance story for older teens.", "Even by standards of Ron Bass, who has written soupy chick flicks, this fake emotional drama is a minor work; too bad French helmer Berliner made his English-speaking debut with this trifle", "Exhibits little passion and even less mind.", "", "", "", "", "", "Never comes up with a compelling reason to care.", "Somewhat interesting parallel lives story, but needed more ambiguity.", "", "...there is too little happening here to sustain such a long movie.", "Sometimes, with its candlelit castles and love scenes played out in spacious antique bathtubs, \"Passion\" seems less like a movie than it does a glossy catalog spread out all over the big screen.", "", "Call me a cynic, there's only so much bitten back lovey-dovey looks I can take before wishing Jay and Silent Bob would show up and start cracking obnoxious jokes.", "", "", ""], "rating": ["", "D+", "3/5", "C-", "D+", "2/5", "2/5", "2/5", "1/5", "0/4", "2/4", "2/5", "2/5", "2/4", "", "1.5/4", "D+", "D+", "0.5/4", "4/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Christy Lemire", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Nell Minow", "Emanuel Levy", "Frank Swietek", "", "Emanuel Levy", "Philip Martin", "Sarah Chauncey", "Chuck Walton", "Michael Dequina", "Fred Topel", "", "David Nusair", "James Sanford", "", "Jeremiah Kipp", "", "", "Rob Blackwelder"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Guy&#39;s Opinion", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieReport.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">About.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">James Sanford on Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Globe and Mail", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flipside Movie Emporium", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">SPLICEDWire"], "date": ["June 12, 2018", "September 7, 2011", "December 27, 2010", "June 10, 2007", "December 6, 2005", "December 6, 2005", "June 19, 2005", "January 26, 2005", "June 4, 2004", "February 21, 2004", "January 13, 2004", "July 14, 2003", "December 8, 2002", "November 8, 2002", "June 15, 2002", "March 22, 2002", "October 24, 2001", "May 26, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000"]}}
