{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In New York City, an insolent pickpocket, Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark), inadvertently sets off a chain of events when he targets ex-prostitute Candy (Jean Peters) and steals her wallet. Unaware that she has been making deliveries of highly classified information to the communists, Candy, who has been trailed by FBI agents for months in hopes of nabbing the spy ringleader, is sent by her ex-boyfriend, Joey (Richard Kiley), to find Skip and retrieve the valuable microfilm he now holds.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 20m", "director": "Samuel Fuller", "studio": "TwentiethCenturyFox", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 17, 2004", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...a compelling premise that's employed to watchable yet decidedly erratic effect by Fuller...", "...a well-plotted underworld story. A couple of scenes seem unnecessarily brutal, but my interest never lagged.", "Insanely slangy, deliriously hard-boiled noir...", "While applauding the patriotism of his low-lifes, Fuller powerfully evokes a '50s world of brutality, compromise and redemption.", "It took a director with Samuel Fuller's oblique angle of approach to find a vein of poetic anarchism in the conformist heart of the 1950s police-procedural melodrama.", "Like a spiky romantic comedy got stuck in one of the 1950s' bleakest visions of humanity - and it somehow all works magnificently.", "This atmospheric Cold War crime picture is a class act.", "As good as are Widmark, with his proto-Method grin, and Peters, with her tawny, untutored naturalism, this is Thelma Ritter's movie. She transforms what could have been no more than a colorful eccentric to a figure of unshakable dignity.", "Samuel Fuller's a master of unpretentious hot-house poetry, and that theoretical contradiction of terms gives one an idea of the irresolvable, elegantly compact flourishes that abound in his films.", "Fuller's pugnacious direction and his gutter-up view of city life romanticize both the criminal code of honor and the jangling paranoia of global plots; his hard-edged long takes depict underworld cruelty with reportorial wonder ...", "Cold War anxiety merely heightens the already-combustible fabric of everyday America in Samuel Fuller's two-fisted masterpiece", "Almost perfect.", "Both Widmark and Peters are superb, but it is Ritter, as the seedy but much-loved Moe, who gives the film its emotional punch.", "Pickup for the most part falls flat on its face and borders on presumably unintended, comedy.", "Definitely one of the best film noir movies I've seen so far.", "Sam Fuller, who wrote it and directed, appears to have been more concerned with firing a barrage of sensations than with telling a story to be believed.", "", "Great noir piece with Richard Widmark complementing Samuel Fuller's direction.", "Perhaps finally flawed by its overt political assumptions, but the film remains a desperate kind of masterpiece.", ""], "rating": ["2.5/4", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "5/5", "4/5", "", "4/4", "", "", "4/5", "4/4", "", "B+", "2/5", "4/5", "5/5", "", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Nusair", "Clyde Gilmour", "J.
