{"metadata": {"synopsis": "\"Psycho Beach Party\" is a manic party-mix of 50's psychological thrillers, 60's beach movies, and 70's slasher films. The story focuses on Chicklet Forrest (Lauren Ambrose), a sixteen-year old tomboy who's desperate to be part of the in-crowd of Malibu beach surfers. She's the typical American girl - except for one little problem: her personality is split into more slices than a pepperoni pizza.", "rating": "55", "genre": "Comedy/Cult Movies", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Robert Lee King", "studio": "StrandReleasing,RedHorseFilms,NewOzProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 9, 2016", "box_office": "$268.0K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Let me just break it down in high-fidelity stereophonic sound: this film is funny as hell.
