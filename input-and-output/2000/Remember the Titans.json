{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In Virginia, high school football is a way of life, an institution revered, each game celebrated more lavishly than Christmas, each playoff distinguished more grandly than any national holiday. And with such recognition, comes powerful emotions. In 1971 high school football was everything to the people of Alexandria. But when the local school board was forced to integrate an all black school with an all white school, the very foundation of football's great tradition was put to the test.", "rating": "73", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Boaz Yakin", "studio": "RunItUpProductionsInc.,TechnicalBlack,JerryBruckheimerFilms,WaltDisneyPictures", "theater_date": "Sep 29, 2000", "dvd_date": "May 27, 2016", "box_office": "$115.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["So don't bring along your binoculars, folks, because you will be able to spot what is coming from some distance away.", "What's most amazing about these actors is that they make each player a well-defined individual.", "Denzel Washington is just excellent in this role.", "Inspiring football drama brings history to life.", "The crack-of-dawn jog to Gettysburg is the only hokey Hail Mary in an otherwise smart, stirring sports film.
