{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Imaginatively evoking the inner landscape of human beings longing to connect, to love and feel loved, the film is a parable of happiness gloriously found and tragically lost. \"Requiem for a Dream\" tells parallel stories that are linked by the relationship between the lonely, widowed Sara Goldfarb and her sweet but aimless son, Harry. The plump Sara, galvanized by the prospect of appearing on a TV game show, has started on a dangerous diet regimen to beautify herself for a national audience.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Darren Aronofsky", "studio": "IndustryEntertainment,ProtozoaPictures,RequiemforaDreamLLC,ThousandWords,TruthandSoulPictures,ArtisanEntertainment,SiblingProductions,BandeiraEntertainment", "theater_date": "Oct 27, 2000", "dvd_date": "Dec 6, 2015", "box_office": "$3.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["As fascinating as it is disturbing. It's still a harrowing visit into a world not often revealed with such honesty, even if it feels artistic. [Full review in Spanish].", "Though all aspects of the film are excellent from story to cinematography to directing it is the acting which holds the whole thing together. The three leads are amazing.", "While a whiff of symbolism softens the horror elements in Pi, no such escape is provided in Requiem for a Dream (2000)...", "At times disturbing and always intense, this flick offers its own acid trip for viewers and is a first-hand look at four people who become trapped by their own hell.", "As uncompromising a work of art as you can ever view.", "A staccato narrative parallels the experiences and hallucinations of a woman on drugs with those of her son and his friends.", "Aronofsky's second feature is an emotionally intense, relentlessly grim tale of forms of addiction that may rely too much on montage to achieve real dramatic impact.", "Translating this into a music video would make a lot more sense than the film does in present form", "\"Dream\" glamorizes nothing en route to a near-nauseating finale, which feels like a rollercoaster car hitched off the track and hurtled into hell's depths. A decade later, it still follows through with full force on its cautionary stomach punch.", "Unfortunately, about halfway through, the film takes a (deliberate) nosedive into the depths of human degradation from which it never emerges.", "A gut-wrenching, formally adventurous masterpiece or an ugly, flashy piece of empty-headed propaganda?", "\"Requiem For A Dream\" is a movie about drug addiction, but that's only where the plot resides so the thoroughly drawn characters can work toward their imperfect dreams. Cinema history has been made with this", "One of the most powerful I have ever seen. The film's score and editing will haunt you for years to come.", "Yes, visually this is an exhilarating, unique film. But it is also a singularly difficult and challenging film to watch.", "Seldom has a film so powerfully affected me as Requiem for a Dream has -- affected, in this case, as if my eyes and psyche have been bludgeoned.", "If Aronofsky set out to make Trainspotting look like Teletubbies, he succeeded. Recommended only for those with extremely strong stomachs.", "Requiem for a Dream is meant to have a hallucinatory, mesmerizing quality, but it manages to be about as enlightening as a bad acid trip.", "Burnished camerawork and ex-Pop Will Eat Itself head Mansell's part-punchy, part-elegiac score reinforce and counterpoint the increasingly nightmarish visuals.", "Requiem for a Dream is a great movie, and the few of us who see it will be acutely affected.", "There's a wholehearted commitment in every frame toward synthesizing the feeling of hopeless addiction. It's in the writing. It's in the chaotic cinematography. It's in the actors' eyes."], "rating": ["4/4", "4/5", "7/10", "A", "A", "", "B", "C-", "4/4", "", "2/4", "A-", "5/5", "3.5/4", "A", "", "C", "", "", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Federico Furzan", "Carey-Ann Pawsey", "Sarah Boslaugh", "Candice Frederick", "Christopher Runyon", "Lisa Alspector", "Emanuel Levy", "John A.
