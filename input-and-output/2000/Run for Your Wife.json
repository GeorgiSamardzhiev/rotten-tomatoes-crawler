I guess the past really is a foreign country. One populated exclusively by toddlers.", "Truly dire. An offensive, witless farrago... The film's social attitudes - to homosexuality, women, marriage - appear to have been preserved in mothballs since the 1970s. Given air now, they give off an offensive odour.", "British farces work on stage, but usually feel agonisingly stupid on screen. And this is a worst-case scenario, as playwright Cooney adapts his classic 1983 farce without even the slightest adjustment for the cinema.", "Unfortunately, there's no irony or retro self-awareness about this adaptation, which is played as if the last 30 years simply haven't happened.", "It is abysmal, dealing in outdated stereotypes that will leave you in a state of appalled amazement.", "I appreciate Run For Your Wife is supposed to be dumb, but rarely has a film aimed so low and missed its target so woefully.", "The trouser-dropping 80s stage farce finally hits the big screen with Danny Dyer, to kill off any remaining British self-respect.", "The end result feels more like a museum relic than a zinging contemporary comedy.", "Run for the exit.", "A bizarre, ill-advised antediluvian folly. Like Jurassic Park.", "Run for Your Wife is undoubtedly corny, thanks to a bad script, dreadful acting and lack of comic value, but this British comedy is surprisingly quite watchable.", "Somewhere out there is a Royal Variety show missing its line-up.", "So poorly executed and the material so hopelessly dated that it traduces its (sort of) honourable origins as a theatrical farce to become nothing less than utterly farcical.", "Hopelessly dated, poorly executed material.", "Doesn't even count as a missed opportunity."], "rating": ["", "", "1.5/5", "2/5", "0/5", "1/5", "1/5", "1/5", "1/5", "2/5", "2/5", "2/5", "1/5", "", "1/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Charlie Lyne", "Jason Best", "Rich Cline", "David Aldridge", "Christopher Tookey", "Grant Rollings", "Peter Bradshaw", "Simon Reynolds", "Tom Huddleston", "Adam Lee Davies", "Jennifer Tate", "Damon Wise", "Miles Fielder", "Allan Hunter", "Neil Smith"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Ultra Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Talk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Contactmusic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Mail (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Sun (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Digital Spy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Little White Lies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ViewLondon", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The List", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film"], "date": ["February 19, 2013", "February 16, 2013", "February 15, 2013", "February 15, 2013", "February 15, 2013", "February 15, 2013", "February 14, 2013", "February 14, 2013", "February 14, 2013", "February 14, 2013", "February 14, 2013", "February 11, 2013", "February 11, 2013", "February 4, 2013", "January 25, 2013"]}}
