He's just a sad aristocrat in tattered finery, and the film seems as deflated as he does.", "The reason to see \"Sade\" lay with the chemistry and complex relationship between the marquis (Auteil) and Emilie (Le Besco).", "Featuring a dangerously seductive performance from the great Daniel Auteuil, \"Sade\" covers the same period as Kaufmann's \"Quills\" with more unsettlingly realistic results.", "More concerned with Sade's ideas than with his actions. The movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as... [Quills] did by showing them.", "If you're looking for a smart, nuanced look at de Sade and what might have happened at Picpus, Sade is your film.", "The movie fails to portray its literarily talented and notorious subject as anything much more than a dirty old man.", "Lacks dramatic punch and depth.", "There has always been something likable about the Marquis de Sade.", "It's a decent glimpse into a time period, and an outcast, that is no longer accessible, but it doesn't necessarily shed more light on its subject than the popular predecessor.", "The movie is as far as you can get from racy, to the point where it almost stops the blood flow to your brain; it has a dull, costumey feel."], "rating": ["3/5", "4/5", "3/5", "", "B+", "4/5", "3/4", "2/4", "2.5/4", "3/4", "2.5/4", "B-", "B", "3/4", "3/4", "2/4", "3/5", "4/5", "2.5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Cole Smithey", "", "Emanuel Levy", "MaryAnn Johanson", "Tom Sime", "Rich Cline", "Nick Carter", "Phil Villarreal", "Marta Barber", "Wesley Morris", "Loren King", "Robin Clifford", "Laura Clifford", "Jeffrey M.
