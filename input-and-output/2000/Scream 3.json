It's failed but one can never deny it's a movie made with passion. [Full review in Spanish].", "The series is already so dense with internal references and exposition that it's on the verge of becoming more of a trivia game than a movie series. Still, for the initiated, the third time's a charm. For everyone else, it's just a scream.", "Dimension Films is again asking reviewers not to reveal the plot twists in Scream 3... But the screenplay telegraphs the ending long before it arrives.", "The Scream franchise falters with this unconvincing wrap-up to the original trilogy.", "[The cast] is good. And so are director Wes Craven's inventive stagings of these set-tos. Not so good is the absence of hip cross-references to the classic horror tropes.", "While there's still plenty of gore, the emphasis on knowing, self-referential gags makes for a better movie.", "Scream 3 may well be the best of the bunch. It's got scenes that will make you jump, characters that you'll care something about, and so much of a self-referential content that it folds in on itself again and again and again, like an origami figure.", "The final chapter in the Scream franchise ends on a highly entertaining and hilarious note.", "Virtually none of the craftsmanship of Craven's best is on display here, and what good ideas do turn up are largely recycled from previous efforts. This Scream has been widely marketed as the series' final installment. Better late than never.", "There are a couple classic Scream kills, splashes of blood, a depraved new addition to the Maureen Prescott story, and Roger Corman shows up for a cameo.", "Scream 3 is a fine ending to the trilogy. The teen horror franchise that ate itself.", "Tthe movie belabors the idea that it's the last of a trilogy rather than the third in a series.", "Merely adheres to the very convoluted whodunit formula that it outwardly addresses via a from-the-grave video recording by Jamie Kennedy's genre know-it-all.", "The self-referential setup is in place, but not the ingenuity or wit to take advantage of it.", "...a rather anticlimactic finish to a series that started out with such promise...", "An embarrassing carbon copy of its previous films...", "End (hopefully) to the hit slasher saga.", "Missing from the third installment are many of original scribe Kevin Williamson's self-referential genre jokes and a lot of his energetic bravura."], "rating": ["3/5", "3/10", "2.5/4", "3/4", "", "2/5", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "3/5", "", "", "C-", "2/4", "2.5/4", "", "2/5", "1/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Trace Thurman", "Mike Massie", "Federico Furzan", "Jack Mathews", "Malcolm Johnson", "Alan Jones", "Richard Schickel", "Leah Rozen", "John Wooley", "Lisa Leigh Connors", "Keith Phipps", "C.H.
