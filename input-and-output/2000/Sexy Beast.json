{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Ex-villain Gal Dove (Ray Winstone) has served his time behind bars and is blissfully retired to a Spanish villa paradise with a wife he adores. The idyll is shattered by the arrival of his nemesis Don Logan (Ben Kingsley), intent on persuading Gal to return to London for one last big job. Desperate not to sacrifice his enchanted existence, Dove is drawn into a shocking battle of wills with Logan, and takes part in a sensational underwater heist, risking everything to protect the woman he loves.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Jonathan Glazer", "studio": "RecordedPicturesCompany,JonathanGlazerFilm,JeremyThomasProduction", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$6.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The movie needs to be seen for its clean compositions, for its sure touch of fantasy, and, above all, for the forbidding presence of Kingsley-the prince of darkness, lightly disguised as a human being.", "[Jonathan] Glazer's brilliant reimagining of the crime drama is character and performance driven, with a capital C and P.", "...a visceral, mostly captivating thriller that features one of modern cinema's very best villains.", "A stylish, innovative and utterly compelling British crime drama which has stood the test of time very well indeed.", "An extended short film par excellence, and we're permitted to luxuriate in Glazer's skills.", "It's this formal vigor that elevates Sexy Beast well above its generic crime-picture roots.", "Stands head and shoulders above the late 90s flurry of British gangster movies. Stylish and confident and built upon a fearsome performance from Ben Kinglsey.", "It's not just the ironic kick of watching the guy who played Gandhi get his rocks off on sociopathic violence. Ben Kingsley's Don Logan is one of cinema's all-time fearsome, loathsome villains - stalking even the frames from which he's absent.", "When you get the chance, give this one a look.", "Winstone e (especialmente) Kingsley carregam o filme com suas atua\u00e7\u00f5es magn\u00e9ticas, enquanto Glazer confere charme \u00e0 narrativa com sua abordagem bem-humorada. Infelizmente, o terceiro ato n\u00e3o sobrevive \u00e0 aus\u00eancia do personagem mais interessante do projeto.", "The talented Glazer keeps things crisp, clean and purposeful. The only flab on this film is around the waist of its sybaritic hero, a working-class crook who has finally gotten a taste of the good life, and doesn't want to lose it.", "This slight-seeming but trim and absorbing British import deepens in your head the more you chew it over later.", "A film that takes a familiar premise -- in this case, a retired thief who is asked to pull one last job -- and makes it exciting again through the use of interesting characters, elegant camerawork and exhilarating storytelling.", "A fun gangster film, telling the tale of you-can-never-really-leave that The Godfather, among others, championed so well.", "From the off it's clear at once that Jonathan Glazer will be a ballsy, switched-on film-maker.", "An astonishing underwater robbery scene highlights this amazingly staged and acted film. A must-see.", "It's nice to see a new director willing to spend as much time with his actors as he does moving the camera around.", "Most crime stories, from Cain and Abel to Macbeth to Bonnie and Clyde to Pulp Fiction, show us that crime doesn't pay. Sexy Beast has more to say than that.", "a chilly comedy of the darkest kind, set in a world where sentences are punctuated with profanities, weapons sometimes fall apart at unfortunate moments and people say things like 'You've got very nice eyes... Are they real?'", "Like Lee Marvin from Point Blank or Michael Caine in (the original) Get Carter, he's a force of nature; a hurricane-like dervish once unleashed cannot be contained."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "4/4", "3/4", "3/5", "", "4/5", "3.5/4", "B-", "", "3/4", "4/5", "B", "3.5/4", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Anthony Lane", "Tom Meek", "David Nusair", "Leigh Paatsch", "PJ Nabarro", "Calum Marsh", "Film4 Staff", "Nick Rogers", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Pablo Villa\u00e7a", "David Ansen", "Rob Gonsalves", "Joe Lozito", "Jason Gorber", "", "Jeffrey M.
