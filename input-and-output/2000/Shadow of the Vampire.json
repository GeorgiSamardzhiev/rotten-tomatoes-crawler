{"metadata": {"synopsis": "F. W. Murnau (John Malkovich) is struggling to create his silent classic \"Nosferatu\" on location in Eastern Europe. The director is obsessed with making this the most authentic vampire movie ever. To that end, Murnau has employed a real vampire, Max Schreck (Willem Dafoe), explaining to the crew that he is the ultimate of that new breed, the \"method actor\" -- trained by Stanislavsky himself. Schreck will appear only in character and only at night.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Drama/Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "E.

[I]f you like your horror thoughtful and provoking, this is your movie.", "The screenplay, by Steven Katz, suffers from arch, almost unspeakably theatrical dialogue, and, as Murnau, John Malkovich recites his lines as if monomania were synonymous with monotonic: He drains the drama of blood.", "An imaginatively twisted lesson in film history and a glorious gothic comedy-drama.", "Wholly absorbing and inspired in parts, this carefully crafted curio dares to suggest that Murnau made a Faustian pact with an actual vampire to play the title role in exchange for the neck of the film's leading lady at production's end.", "At best, this is a dawdling, toothless riff on a vastly superior film. At worst, it's character assassination.", "Shadow feels like a missed opportunity.", "Intriguing, eccentric, sporadically entertaining tosh (but tosh all the same).", "Through layers of makeup depicting the rat-faced, undead Schreck, a vampire who turns not into a bat but, worse, a demanding prima donna, Dafoe doesn't go over the top, though he does plant his flag at the summit.", "Incredibly entertaining even without knowledge of Nosferatu.", "In this cookie cutter movie world, it's nice to see the occasional move that doesn't quite fit into a specific genre or can't easily be classified.", "What might have occurred during the filming of Nosferatu leaves one amused but confused about how much of Shadow is a spoof and how much is based in truth.", "interesting and very good", "Unusual and delightful.", "A sinister delight for the black at heart."], "rating": ["", "3/5", "B", "3/5", "3/4", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "2/5", "2.5/4", "", "", "8/10", "3/4", "3/4", "4/4", "A-", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Brody", "Tom Hutchinson", "John A.
