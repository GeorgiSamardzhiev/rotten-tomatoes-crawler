{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Bumbling Chon Wang (Jackie Chan) works as an Imperial guard in the Forbidden City of China. When Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu) is taken hostage, Wang pursues her captors to the wild frontier land of Nevada, where he meets good-natured thief and occasional cowboy Roy O'Bannon (Owen Wilson). Using O'Bannon's love of money, Wang convinces him to help recover the princess, and together the two form a curious partnership -- the likes of which the West has never seen.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Western", "runtime": "1h 50m", "director": "Tom Dey", "studio": "RogerBirnbaumProductions,TouchstonePictures,SpyglassEntertainment,JackieChanFilms", "theater_date": "May 26, 2000", "dvd_date": "Dec 10, 2015", "box_office": "$56.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Shanghai Noon feels both like a flashback to an earlier time of more innocent pictures, and also slightly predictive of the vanguard of colourful comic-book cinema to come.", "It's a clever variation on the buddy cop picture, with Jackie Chan showing both his comic chops and his martial arts skills, and Owen Wilson doing what he does best-playing a laid-back, chick-magnet California surfer dude.", "You can't get a whole lot less substantial than this, but well-played, friendly banter is tough to do, and the film hits its mark perfectly on that front.", "Though the film nakedly seeks a wide audience through conventional plotting and characterization&mdash;and despite being (like most action movies) guy-centric&mdash;Shanghai Noon provides good, clean \"family\" fun. [Blu-ray]", "Engaging Jackie Chan movie for older teens and up.", "As far as light, brainless summer entertainment goes, it makes the grade.", "The first half of this film is great entertainment, and then it starts to unravel, but not before Chan establishes himself as a dynamic comedian.", "The movie walks the line between good stupid humor and embarrassing stupid humor, and usually manages to stay on the good side.", "This movie is not about plot (which is a shame because there might have been a good story to tell here), it's about fun Martial Arts action. And Mr. Chan as usual, delivers. Service with a smile.", "Much of its strength comes from the central clash between Jackie's indomitable energy and Wilson's knowingly anachronistic cool, while lots of visual and verbal gags keep things whistling.", "I'm pleased to report that Shanghai Noon is the best Jackie Chan movie in many moons.", "Dey ultimately lets Chan down. If the legendary actor could have brought in old school chum Sammo Hung, he could have made this a great picture.", "", "Having Jackie Chan's capable martial arts talents involved in this mix helps to keep the humor level high and the fight scenes exciting.", "While the western boastfulness may get on your nerves, Owen Wilson and Jackie Chan make the adventure a barrel of fun.", "Director Tom Dey does an admirable job of capturing all the tremendous agility of Chan. It almost seems like Sammo Hung, one of Chan's best Asian directors, was working in tandem with Dey.", "The movie Wild Wild West should have been.", "", "Wilson is the glue that holds the story together, and propels Shanghai Noon to the same stature held by Rush Hour.", ""], "rating": ["3/5", "B+", "7/10", "3/4", "3/5", "3/4", "3/5", "4/5", "2.5/4", "", "3/4", "3.5/5", "4/5", "B", "B+", "4/5", "3/4", "3/4", "3.5/5", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Tony Black", "James Plath", "Tim Brayton", "Peter Canavese", "Nell Minow", "Michael Dequina", "Bob Grimm", "Rob Gonsalves", "Joe Lozito", "Derek Adams", "Jeffrey M.
