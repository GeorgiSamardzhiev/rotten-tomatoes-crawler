{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A film about a woman whose drive to pursue the things she believes in leads her on an unexpected path to self-discovery. It is 1907, and musicologist Doctor Lily Penleric (Janet McTeer) has just been denied a promotion in the male-dominated world of her university. Frustrated and determined to get academic recognition, she heads to Appalachia with a recording device and writing materials.", "rating": "74", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts/Romance", "runtime": "1h 52m", "director": "Maggie Greenwald", "studio": "ErgoArts,RigasEntertainment,IndependentFilmProject", "theater_date": "Jun 15, 2001", "dvd_date": "Nov 5, 2015", "box_office": "$3.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "Like the main character, it's stodgy and didactic -- and full of grace and surprises.", "an uneven path, like the mountainous scenery itself", "Never overcomes its overly familiar story and structure, even with some catchy traditional music generously spread throughout.", "Songcatcher unfolds at a leisurely but enjoyable pace, its dramatic contrivances never pushed too hard by director Maggie Greenwald.", "In this exceptional film, mercifully free of the usual warm and fuzzy movie sentimentality, director Maggie Greenwald and her fine cast shatter most hillbilly stereotypes.", "This slice of trenchant Americana, grabs you by your lapels, churns you up a bit, and soon has you slapping your knees with blissful exuberance", "the presentation [of mountain music]evokes its deep emotions and a beauty that comes from life experience, not the pre-packaged pap courtesy of slick marketing types.", "Buy the soundtrack. Skip the film.", "Songcatcher is better than 75% of films in theaters today, blending the earthy integrity of the rural poor with the honest performances of a talented cast.", "Such a lyrical, moving independent film is a rare thing to find; Songcatcher is gorgeously made, perfectly cast and thoroughly engaging.", "Though writer/director Maggie Greenwald wraps her story around a wincingly trite yarn ... she keeps her film afloat by focusing on the music. But, when the tunes stop, so does the magic.", "Forget the silly plot; see this for the music.", "The music, lovingly performed by such paragons as Alison Kraus, Emmylou Harris, Taj Mahal and Iris Dement, takes on the importance of a character in the movie.", "The movie becomes more than just a story about the music, of course, as McTeer's musicologist comes to understand and appreciate the locals' way of life... and maybe there'll be a little romance along the way?", "Promising but ultimately disappointing historically derived &#64257;ction.", "", "... like its prickly heroine, the film doesn't always achieve its goals ...", "Such a lyrical, moving independent film is a rare thing to find; Songcatcher is gorgeously made, perfectly cast and thoroughly engaging.", "The film is beautifully photographed like a Hallmark tourist postcard..."], "rating": ["B", "", "C+", "2/4", "", "4.5/5", "", "4/5", "0.5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "3/4", "3.5/5", "", "6", "3.5/5", "4/5", "C+"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Emanuel Levy", "Lisa Alspector", "John A.
