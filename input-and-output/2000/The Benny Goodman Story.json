After playing for a few years, an older Benny (Steve Allen) gains the attention of critic John Hammond (Herbert Anderson), who champions the musician. Benny also meets John's sister, Alice (Donna Reed), and, although she initially dislikes jazz, Goodman wins her over. However, Benny's mother (Berta Gersten) does not approve of the match.", "rating": "71", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "Valentine Davies", "studio": "Universal/UniversalInt", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 4, 2003", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Dull in the drama department, this hi-fi tribute to America's King of Swing is nonetheless recommended for jazz enthusiasts.
