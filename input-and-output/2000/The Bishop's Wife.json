{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Dejected by his efforts to raise money to build a cathedral, Bishop Henry Brougham (David Niven) beseeches heaven for guidance, and is visited immediately by Dudley (Cary Grant), who claims to be an angel.

When Dudley continues to intervene in Henry's struggles, the bishop decides to challenge heaven.", "rating": "84", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Romance/Faith & Spirituality", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Henry Koster", "studio": "SamuelGoldwynCompany", "theater_date": "Feb 16, 1948", "dvd_date": "Mar 5, 2014", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The Bishop's Wife is a joyous film.", "With the formidable Gladys Cooper and Elsa Lanchester in supporting roles, it's a sweet, funny, captivating, altogether delightful picture, which too often gets omitted from lists of greatest-ever Christmas films.", "Whatever you make of the minor miracles performed along the way, there's no trouble believing that Cary would fall for Loretta or that anybody would fall for Cary.", "The playing from all three stars is enjoyable and the festive setting allows Grant to trim a Christmas tree with the flick of a finger.", "Grant's turn is thoroughly convincing because he himself appears to be having a terrific time: He's expansive, graceful, and seems always on the verge of chuckling with goodwill.", "It is a big, slick production.
