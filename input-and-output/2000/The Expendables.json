Dumb. Silly. Moronic. Sub-Moronic. Imbecilic.", "Any need for this? No. Man-porn at its best. [Full review in Spanish].", "Unfortunately, The Expendables does nothing to update anything for the new millennium.", "Treats its audience as a friend, inviting one and all to share in the fun; the dialogue, as atrocious as it is, is recited knowing wholeheartedly the very audience sharing the joke on the other side of the screen.", "A minor film on this sort of scale is always a major gesture.", "The Expendables is more than just your average action movie; it is the action movie of the year uniting the grittiness and soul of the old genre with the special effects and coolness of the new genre. See it.", "Trust me, [there's] a scene you need to witness with a crowd that whoops and cheers, which is really what this film demands of its audience throughout.", "Some kind of meatheaded masterpiece, it's cinematic junk food of the highest order.", "What The Expendables does right is it caters to its fans. It knows exactly what they want and it delivers a a pure, adrenaline-fuelled thrill ride with some great action.", "The action scenes are huge and excessively violent on a scale not seen since the closing scenes of Commando. At one point, in the absence of any buildings to detonate or ammunition depots to destroy, I think I saw an explosion explode.", "What we end up with is an incomprehensible, overly-long explosion-fest that could have easily been retitled \"A.D.D.: The Motion Picture.\"", "the kind of all-out, over the top action movie they just don't make anymore, which is probably a good thing because the human brain can only take a movie that provides the equivalent to getting three consecutive adrenaline shots so many times.", "I like the idea of this movie much more than how it actually turned out.", "", "This has been clearly aimed at - pardon the pun - diehard action film fans. Anyone else, who might expect a vague sense of irony, will be sorely disappointed.", "... It's a little like meeting up with old friends, only to come away deflated, realising you just don't have that much to talk about any more.", "Stallone, with his highly unusual current face, is so busy making googly eyes at Statham and nursing a man-crush that he forgets that the goal of this movie is MORE KILLING.", "If you are a connoisseur of the Steven Seagal flavor of direct-to-DVD action film, seeing all these guys up on screen actually is a lot of fun. It doesn't make it a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, but it's still a lot of fun."], "rating": ["", "7/10", "2.0/4", "1/4", "2/5", "4/5", "", "A", "4/5", "", "8/10", "4/5", "2/4", "8.5/10", "2.5/4", "B", "2/5", "", "2.5/5", "5.5/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Jason Best", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Federico Furzan", "David Harris", "Jack Porter", "Ignatiy Vishnevetsky", "Candice Frederick", "Brigit Grant", "Sean Burns", "Matt Joseph", "Ali Gray", "Jeff Beck", "Jeffrey Lyles", "Austin Kennedy", "Nell Minow", "Laurence Boyce", "Ed Whitfield", "Dave White", "Joshua Starnes"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Talk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinelipsis", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MUBI", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Talk Online", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Express (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Improper Bostonian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">We Got This Covered", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheShiznit.co.uk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Examiner.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lyles&#39; Movie Files", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sin Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Mom", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Baltic Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Ooh Tray", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ComingSoon.net"], "date": ["December 4, 2020", "November 29, 2020", "September 7, 2020", "June 3, 2020", "October 28, 2019", "November 5, 2018", "November 19, 2017", "September 11, 2017", "August 22, 2017", "May 9, 2015", "November 9, 2013", "September 28, 2012", "September 23, 2012", "August 15, 2012", "May 12, 2012", "February 18, 2012", "December 13, 2011", "June 30, 2011", "April 4, 2011", "March 21, 2011"]}}
