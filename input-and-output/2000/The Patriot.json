{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The final days of the mad, tyrannical Czar Paul I of Russia (Emil Jannings) are recounted. As the Czar behaves erratically and goes after his mistress (Vera Voronina), Count Pahlen (Lewis Stone), his friend, plots to kill the ruler and liberate the Russians. Pahlen convinces palace guard Stefan (Harry Cording) to carry out the murder. This semi-biographical story is based on three plays: \"Paul I\" by Dmitri Merezhkovsky, \"Der Patriot\" by Alfred Neumann and \"The Patriot\" by Ashley Dukes.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Ernst Lubitsch", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["We recall no sequence either hackneyed, trivial or tedious. In all technical respects The Patriot is equally satisfactory.", "In many ways, this picture is Lubitsch hitting at his old stride, with perhaps less glamor and glitter, but with full dramatic force. Even some weakness of story can be overlooked in the general effect, because there are so many high spots of interest.", "There can be no other opinion than that The Patriot is a masterpiece from the point of view of direction and acting.", "Mr. Emil Jannings in the part of the mad Tsar uses the precise observation of the modern actor, but only to increase the fantastic element of his part.", "Many elements combine to give The Patriot a valid claim to greatness, much as that word has been abused in cinemania.", "There is, as a matter of fact, hardly a flaw to be found in the whole picture. It is a gripping piece of work with subtle touches that answer at times the purpose of comedy. It grinds its way along for nearly two hours without slackening.", "When most screen productions are forgotten, it can be said that The Patriot... will be vividly remembered.", "Emil Jannings as the tsar, Lewis Stone as the count are more than interesting: they are true.", "Although the past achievements of Emil Jannings and Ernest Lubitsch as actor and director, respectively, have such as to entitle them to undisputed places in the hall of fame of moviedom, each seems to have eclipsed himself in The Patriot."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Edward Cushing", "Edwin Schallert", "P.S.
