{"metadata": {"synopsis": "1971. A nation stands divided over the escalating war in Vietnam. Thousands of young Americans lie dead on foreign soil. And at Fort Polk, Louisiana, thousands more prepare to join them. The specter of combat hangs over the men of A-Company, Second Platoon, as they enter the final stage of infantry training. They will be sent to the war. But each man deals with this prospect in his own way. One man's defiance, however, galvanizes every member of the platoon.", "rating": "77", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Joel Schumacher", "studio": "RegencyEntertainment,KirchMedia,NewRegencyPictures,HaftEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 9, 2015", "box_office": "$139.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's nothing like the first half of Full Metal Jacket, but an intriguing companion watch.", "I wouldn't put Tigerland in the top ranks of war movies, but it's a solid second-tier entry that makes you think about the characters.", "Farrell is the best thing about the film, which veers into oversentimentality quite a bit for a film that's shot with such a gritty aesthetic.", "This take on Vietnam War doesn't break new thematic ground but it's Schumacher's best film since the 1993 Falling Down, and it showcases the talents of newcomer Colin Farrell, who has everything that it takes to become a major Hollywood star", "Stylistically this is more interesting and more affected than Schumacher's Flawless. Either way, it's a big improvement on his past tendentious nonsense.", "Ever since Three Kings redefined just how great a war movie can be, movies like Tigerland have become unforgivable.", "A talented newcomer with genuine presence, Farrell is able to suggest some complexity in a character that is written without any.", "...never quite catches fire or becomes the searing expose that director Schumacher intended.", "", "", "Farrell holds the film together as the one element that sets this a notch above the average military drama.", "Tigerland will only reinforce one of the biggest complaints regarding Schumacher's work: that it's all about the look, not the material.", "At best, Tigerland is not much more than a low-rated, cable-channel movie-of-the-week that should be channel-surfed right on by.", "The hype is justified -- Farrell's performance just screams star quality and has already drawn comparisons with Steve McQueen and Paul Newman.", "", "A worthy addition to the Vietnam War film genre.", "", "One of the most potent explorations of the military mind-set, irrespective of the war in question, that you'll ever see.
