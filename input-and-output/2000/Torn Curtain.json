{"metadata": {"synopsis": "American physicist Michael Armstrong (Paul Newman) shocks his friends and family by defecting to East Germany to work with the Soviets during the height of the Cold War. Even his fianc\u00e9e (Julie Andrews) is surprised by the move, but when she follows him behind the Iron Curtain, she discovers that her husband-to-be isn't a spy, but a double agent working to discover Soviet nuclear secrets. As they plot a way to escape back to America, his cover is blown, putting both of their lives in jeopardy.", "rating": "67", "genre": "Classics/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 8m", "director": "Alfred Hitchcock", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 5, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It certainly deserves an honourable place among his second-division works, like Strangers on the Train.", "Alas, good Hitchcock touches no longer make a good Hitchcock film, and Curtain falls, more redolent of mothballs than mystery.", "What looked in its day to be a failure and a disappointment to fans of maestro Alfred Hitchcock now reveals itself to be, if not a key work, then at least the movie that contains one of Hitch's most compelling sequences.", "It's extremely clear that Hitchcock didn't want to make this film, at least not the way he had to make it.", "The chase is just cat and mouse with a clawiess cat. Not, of course, that Hitchcock's own claws are quite sheathed.", "Dismissed by many as part of Hitchcock's regrettable declining years, Torn Curtain turns out to be a surprisingly tense and intimate spy thriller.", "Much of the film is stunning.", "Hitchcock's 50th feature is one of his weakest, but it's worth seeing for the place it occupies in the master's career, his attempt to come to terms with the new movie market, genres, and tastes.", "While there are some undeniably tense moments, this is Hitchcock on autopilot, and quite unrewarding.", "Alfred Hitchcock's 1966 spy thriller has one of the lowest reputations of his late works. Coming after a masterpiece like Marnie, it almost had to be a disappointment. But Hitchcock was incapable of making an uninteresting film.", "Dull and way too long, Torn Curtain is only memorable for one very shocking and brutal scene.", "Hitchcock freshens up his bag of tricks in a good potpourri which becomes a bit stale through a noticeable lack of zip and pacing.", "A strangely muted, dull effort, though still worthy of attention.", "", "Hitchcock's fiftieth film retains Marnie's super-fake process shots and soundstage sets, but renders them in near-abstract minimalism, creating a world of utter sterility.", "Torn Curtain is not a total disaster.", "An above-average quota of glaringly shaky process work; but at least one classic sequence of protracted violence in a farmhouse kitchen.", "Can be viewed as a vastly underrated work.", "One of Mr. Hitchcock's most underrated efforts.", ""], "rating": ["", "", "3/5", "2.5/5", "", "4/5", "4/5", "C+", "", "", "2.5/5", "", "3/4", "4/5", "", "2/4", "", "B", "4/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Ian Cameron", "TIME Staff", "Tony Sloman", "Tim Brayton", "Penelope Houston", "Christopher Lloyd", "Kevin Maher", "Emanuel Levy", "Film4 Staff", "Dave Kehr", "TV Guide Staff", "Variety Staff", "Jeffrey M.
