Vibes is such a dreadful movie that she never has a chance to prove it.", "Vibes stumbles and fumbles and misfires sure-fire one-liners and zany situations; it ends up being both a confused and confusing jumble of half-witted comedy and ridiculous drama.", "Gives off dim vibes among critics and the public.", "Nobody escapes unscathed from the gimmicky script co-authored by blockbuster comedy writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel.", "Vibes is a harmless, painless romp but it's an instance of a sincere attempt at screwball comedy that simply got screwed up.", "If there were an Academy Award for Most Instantly Forgettable Film, the odds-on early favorite would be Vibes.", "Vibes is a low-vibration romantic comedy about two incompatible psychics falling in love on an Ecuadorean treasure hunt, and everything in it seems nine or 10 beats off.", "Move over Madonna; you'd do well to take some acting lessons from fellow- rocker and screen newcomer, Cyndi Lauper.", "Luckily, Vibes has those quirky stars, a wacky threesome who give off good vibes under any circumstances.", "The romantic suspense soon takes a back seat to some singularly unimpressive special effects.", "For those looking for unintentional laughter in their movies, this one is for you.
