{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A seemingly model citizen living in mid-century London, John Christie (Richard Attenborough) is actually a killer. Masquerading as a doctor, he convinces guileless women that he can cure whatever might ail them, and when they follow him to his home, he chokes them to death and buries them in a makeshift graveyard. Based on a series of real-life killings, the story follows John as he cons a pregnant bride (Judy Geeson) and wonders if he might have found a scapegoat in her husband (John Hurt).", "rating": "58", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Richard Fleischer", "studio": "ColumbiaPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 2, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...it can't reconcile its expos\u00e9 on the British justice system which dominates the last third of the film and its lurid reenactments of Christie's crimes.", "The banality of evil takes on a slightly different chill in this effectively low-key drama about a banal nebbish committing unspeakably evil acts.", "Kennedy's book was fiercely confrontational and the film reflects this.
