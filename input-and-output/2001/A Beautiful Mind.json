{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A human drama inspired by events in the life of John Forbes Nash Jr., and in part based on the biography \"A Beautiful Mind\" by Sylvia Nasar. From the heights of notoriety to the depths of depravity, John Forbes Nash Jr. experienced it all. A mathematical genius, he made an astonishing discovery early in his career and stood on the brink of international acclaim. But the handsome and arrogant Nash soon found himself on a painful and harrowing journey of self-discovery.", "rating": "74", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 15m", "director": "Ron Howard", "studio": "ImagineEntertainment,DreamWorks,UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "Jan 4, 2002", "dvd_date": "Aug 20, 2013", "box_office": "$170.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Its inspirational qualities to read more about the real John Nash (and all the things omitted from this biopic) might be the only lasting effect.", "Howard's A Beautiful Mind works because it is not a film about mental illness, but a film about John Nash.", "Profoundly, exhaustingly mediocre, a fussily overdone bit of mindless prestige filmmaking.", "Granted, it's uplifting to see mental illness portrayed on the screen in a humane fashion and world-class intellectuals elevated to heroic status. But A Beautiful Mind feels contrived from beginning to end, a paint-by-the-numbers biography.", "This is stirring and absorbing stuff.", "As competent, affecting biopics go, Mind won't win any prizes, but you've earned yourself the right for more awards consideration, mate.", "A Beautiful Mind isn't really interested in Nash's thoughts, let alone anyone else's.", "Ultimately the message is banal and rather repellent: brainwork wrecks your health.", "Jennifer Connelly [works]. [Full Review in Spanish]", "You've gotta hand it to Howard. He and A Beautiful Mind got me (and I bet will get you) interested in this subject for the first time since \"new math\" ruined it for most of us in high school.", "Crowe is called upon to do not much more than stare solicitously at the heavens, from where inspiration duly arrives, to the accompaniment of some predictably celestial music.", "You're well into the story before you can sift the facts from the hallucinations, a process that's made compelling by Russell Crowe's performance in the lead.", "The second, idealised, sentimentalised half of the film is torture, as we plod through the routine I'm-here-to-help psychiatrist, the walls plastered with cut-up newspapers and the what-happens-when-he-stops-taking-the-medicine stuff.", "The story also comes up with a clever way for Nash to fight his problem: He uses his mind. His illness is a puzzle, after all, and he's good at figuring out puzzles. You'll root for him.", "Despite problems of structure and tone, and some crucial omissions from Nash's actual life, A Beautiful Mind has emerged as one of the season's most enjoyable and popular films.", "A Beautiful Mind is Howard's best movie, and easily one of the best movies of the year.", "A Beautiful Mind is the best film yet from director Howard.", "It's not a crime for the script to gloss over the thornier aspects of Nash's story, but the film seems totally unconvincing, squeezing a real life into a formula that's simultaneously more palatable and less interesting.", "Kudos to Crowe, who can go over the edge without going over the top.", "Crowe is convincingly skittish and bounces enjoyably off Paul Bettany, while Jennifer Connelly earns her Oscar in the would-be thankless role of suffering wife. But this is as dishonest as Hollywood biography gets."], "rating": ["4/10", "3.5/4", "2/5", "C-", "5/5", "", "", "", "3/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "4/4", "", "", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Tim Brayton", "Catherine Graham", "Dominic Bloch", "Brian Miller", "Christopher Borrelli", "Jonathan Romney", "Bibi Ramos", "Barry Paris", "Philip Kerr", "Stuart Klawans", "Matthew Bond", "Matt Soergel", "Emanuel Levy", "Christy Lemire", "Chris Kaltenbach", "Scott Tobias", "Leah Rozen", "Emma Dibdin"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternate Ending", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Santa Cruz Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sky Cinema", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Toledo Blade", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent on Sunday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sensacine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Statesman", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Nation", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Mail on Sunday (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Florida Times-Union", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film"], "date": ["September 25, 2020", "September 2, 2020", "February 24, 2019", "February 21, 2019", "February 21, 2019", "February 19, 2019", "February 19, 2019", "February 28, 2018", "February 27, 2018", "February 27, 2018", "October 21, 2014", "October 21, 2014", "October 21, 2014", "October 21, 2014", "October 21, 2014", "February 4, 2014", "February 4, 2014", "February 4, 2014", "February 4, 2014", "February 4, 2014"]}}
