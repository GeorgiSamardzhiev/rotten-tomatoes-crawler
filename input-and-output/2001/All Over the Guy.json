{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A contemporary romantic comedy about the quest to find the \"one\" when the \"one\" doesn't know he's the \"one.\" \"All Over the Guy\" explores the unlikely pairing of Eli (Dan Bucatinsky) and Tom (Richard Ruccolo), two twentysomethings thrown together by their respective best friends, Jackie (Sasha Alexander) and Brett (Adam Goldberg), in an attempt to ignite their own romance.
