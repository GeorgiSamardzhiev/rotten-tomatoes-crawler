{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Joe (Bruce Willis) and Terry (Billy Bob Thornton) have escaped from prison. Cutting a swath from Oregon through California, these fugitives rob banks in order to finance their scheme for a new -- and somewhat legitimate -- life south of the border.

Kate joins the bandits on their cross-country spree, and eventually she steals something, too: their hearts.", "rating": "64", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 2m", "director": "Barry Levinson", "studio": "CheyenneEnterprises,LotusPictures,MetroGoldwynMayer,EmpirePictures,HydeParkEntertainment", "theater_date": "Oct 12, 2001", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$41.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Tries hard to be a quirky comedy -- God, does it try.", "Adults will get this movie, but kids won't.", "", "Terrible.
