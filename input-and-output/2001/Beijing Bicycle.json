{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A young country boy, Guei (Cui Lin) comes to the big city determined to make it. He soon finds a job as a bike messenger in which he gets a percentage of each delivery, working hard to build up enough credit to own the bike for himself. The bike is stolen and winds up in the hands of Jian (Li Bin), a poor city boy who sees the bike as his way to make friends and impress the girl he loves. With both boys claiming the bike is theirs, a series of fights ensue over what is more than just a bike.", "rating": "62", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Wang Xiaoshuai", "studio": "EasternTelevision,PublicTelevisionServiceFoundation,AsiaticFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$157.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Great tale of two boys' struggle over a bicycle.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "The film's hero is a bore and his innocence soon becomes a questionable kind of inexcusable dumb innocence.", "", "", "", "An artful yet depressing film that makes a melodramatic mountain out of the molehill of a missing bike.", "", "The story has its redundancies, and the young actors, not very experienced, are sometimes inexpressive.", "With Beijing Bicycle, Wang has crafted a picturesque morality tale that slyly depicts the hopelessness of communism while pointing up the essential similarities between people of all classes.", "Beijing Bicycle is a subtle, beautifully made film and a seemingly good-natured social commentary on contemporary Beijing.
