{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A group of Anglican nuns, led by Sister Clodagh (Deborah Kerr), are sent to a mountain in the Himalayas. The climate in the region is hostile and the nuns are housed in an odd old palace. They work to establish a school and a hospital, but slowly their focus shifts. Sister Ruth (Kathleen Byron) falls for a government worker, Mr. Dean (David Farrar), and begins to question her vow of celibacy. As Sister Ruth obsesses over Mr. Dean, Sister Clodagh becomes immersed in her own memories of love.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Faith & Spirituality", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Michael Powell, Emeric Pressburger", "studio": "TheArchers", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 24, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It is a film about bold colors and enormous landscapes, about tension and eroticism boiling beneath the fa\u00e7ades that our characters so desperately try to put up.", "Surprising and compelling in ways you might not expect.", "Black Narcissus (1947) is a provocative, dazzling and rich-colored psychological-religious and sexual drama from the legendary partnership duo of the 'Archers': British director Michael Powell and scriptwriter Emeric Pressburger.", "Black Narcissus is an Archers' film.
