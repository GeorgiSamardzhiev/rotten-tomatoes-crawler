{"metadata": {"synopsis": "While recording sound effects for a slasher flick, Jack Terri (John Travolta) stumbles upon a real-life horror: a car careening off a bridge and into a river. Jack jumps into the water and fishes out Sally (Nancy Allen) from the car, but the other passenger is already dead -- a governor intending to run for president. As Jack does some investigating of his tapes, and starts a perilous romance with Sally, he enters a tangled web of conspiracy that might leave him dead.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Brian De Palma", "studio": "FilmwaysPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 1, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["De Palma's approach is more derivative than in the vein of an homage, and his pacing is way off the mark.", "Respecting the genre, Brian De Palma doesn't use all of his imagination.

[Full review in Spanish]", "A wonderful thriller, densely plotted and so full of thematic resonance that it's almost incapable of supporting its own weight.", "... classic De Palma, with its sinister elegance, meticulous cinematic choreography, voyeuristic obsessions, and fascination with guilt, as well as his most human and mortally vulnerable film.", "In a career fixated on the machinations of filmmaking presented through both a carnal and political eye, Brian De Palma's fascinations converged idyllically with Blow Out.", "If cynicism were a superhero franchise, Blow Out would be its origin story.", "The final moments of Blow Out are among the most shocking and powerful of De Palma's oeuvre, tacking a final note of irony onto a story that is in every other way a straightforward denunciation of power run amok.", "Blow Out integrates De Palma style with narrative urgency and thematic consistency better than any of his films.", "Perfectly contrasts movies that reveal the truth against those which avoid it - a blood-drenched yet stake-free slasher vs. the far more insidious horrors of all-American living.", "", "In the amazingly hyperbolic finale, DePalma conflates patriotism, dirty tricks, violence against women, and slasher movies into a single sick joke.", "There are some neat performances, particularly Travolta's convincing bid to be taken seriously after years of being dismissed as frivolous beefcake.", "A forgotten gem.", "An homage to Blow Up that far outstrips the original in emotional immediacy, political sophistication, and visual style.", "This 1981 release is one of Brian De Palma's more interesting and better-made thrillers, though it's even more abjectly derivative than his Hitchcock imitations.", "With attractive leads and a stylish flair for suspense, De Palma misses sustaining involvement by his distracting allusions to prior films.", "It's a great movie.", "Original for sure story of Travolta's movie sound effects guy recording a real murder."], "rating": ["3/10", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "A", "4/4", "", "", "A", "", "", "4/5", "4/4", "", "", "", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Diego Gal\u00e1n", "Bruce McCabe", "Augusto Mart\u00ednez Torres", "Tim Brayton", "Sean Axmaker", "Jordan Raup", "Bryant Frazer", "James Kendrick", "Sean Axmaker", "William Goss", "Chris Nashawaty", "Rob Nelson", "", "Mark Dinning", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Variety Staff", "Pauline Kael", "Steve Crum"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Globe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternate Ending", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Stream on Demand", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Stage", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Freak Central", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Q Network Film Desk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Parallax View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">City Pages, Minneapolis/St. Paul", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Video-Reviewmaster.com"], "date": ["August 31, 2020", "August 27, 2019", "April 27, 2018", "February 8, 2018", "September 24, 2017", "May 4, 2017", "July 20, 2016", "May 18, 2011", "May 2, 2011", "May 1, 2011", "April 30, 2011", "April 14, 2011", "August 20, 2009", "March 27, 2009", "March 27, 2009", "March 27, 2009", "March 27, 2009", "March 26, 2009", "May 28, 2008", "February 21, 2008"]}}
