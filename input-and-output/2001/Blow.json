{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the turbulence of the 1970s, the international drug trade underwent a fast, violent and lucrative revolution - and one ordinary American was at its center. But in just a few short years, George Jung (Johnny Depp), a high-school football star single handedly became the world's premiere importer of cocaine from Colombia's Medellin cartel, changing the course of an entire generation. \"Blow\" is a high-velocity look at George Jung's spectacular rise and fall.", "rating": "55", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 4m", "director": "Ted Demme", "studio": "SpankyPictures,NewLineCinema,ApostlePictures,AveryPix", "theater_date": "Apr 6, 2001", "dvd_date": "May 8, 2015", "box_office": "$53.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Although Depp has little range, he's acceptable in the lead - a source of calm and emotional steadiness, which contrasts the nervousness and paranoia of his associates.", "The first half of Blow is a shallow but lively fun ride; the audience gets a contact high. But when George's fortunes start to go from bad to worse, so does the movie.", "This is one of the few drug movies where you actually feel a little sorry for the drug-dealing coke-infested lead character.", "Uneven drug trade story has explicit drug use.", "Johnny Depp gives a spellbindingly naturalistic performance that puts a sympathetic face on a powerfully individualistic man unable to shake a world of crime that brought him immense riches and eventually cost him everything he caredabout.", "Does the movie make us care? Not really, which is the movie's basic problem.", "Comes off like a flamboyant cartoon, another film about the deglamorization of glamorous people living it up in the glamorous world of drugs.", "Blow isn't really a classic, but it's a sobering story well-told.", "", "Johnny Depp stars and, despite some pretty awful makeup, nails his performance as George Jung.", "Rambling and confused, the film shows much concern for plot and not enough for characterization, particularly in second half which unfolds as a catalog of events. Misdirected, the usually reliable Depp gives a confused and scattered performance.", "", "Tiene una edicin maravillosa, la fotografa es notable y la direccin bien lograda.", "A worthy companion to Traffic, which isn't all it's cracked up to be, either.", "Overall, Blow just blows.", "", "", "", "", "The filmmakers are torn between presenting George's life story as a cautionary tale, or as a blast."], "rating": ["5/10", "", "A", "3/5", "A-", "5/10", "D+", "4/5", "2.5/4", "", "2/4", "3.5/5", "3/5", "3/4", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "4/5", "3.5/5", "2/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "David Ansen", "Candice Frederick", "M.
