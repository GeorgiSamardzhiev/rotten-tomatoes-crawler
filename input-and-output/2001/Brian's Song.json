{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Although they both play for the Chicago Bears, Brian Piccolo (Sean Maher) is white, a joker and mostly rides the bench while Gale Sayers (Mekhi Phifer) is black, serious and a rookie superstar. Neither likes the other much, but when coach Halas (Ben Gazzara) makes them the first interracial roommates in the NFL, the two gradually form a sincere friendship. Piccolo helps Sayers overcome an injury, and Sayers later gives Piccolo much needed support when he's diagnosed with terminal cancer.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Drama/Television", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "John Gray", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 22, 2002", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's just as much a weepie now as it was then, and just as sweet too.", "", "", "A heart-warming story of camaraderie, courage and manipulated tears."], "rating": ["", "4/5", "2/5", "7"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["John Leonard", "", "Emanuel Levy", "Ryan Cracknell"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Magazine/Vulture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Apollo Guide"], "date": ["February 2, 2018", "January 9, 2006", "August 6, 2005", "October 21, 2002"]}}
