{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Every generation has its muse. In ancient Greece, there was Helen of Troy; the Renaissance had the Mona Lisa; and in early 1900s Vienna, there was Alma Schindler, a bright and sensual young musician who aroused the passions of many. Alma married, in succession, Gustav Mahler, Walter Gropius and Franz Werfel, and she had liaisons with others. The works of some of these European artists changed the world -- yet, it was she who ultimately changed each of them.", "rating": "11", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "Bruce Beresford", "studio": "TotalFilmGroup,FirelightFilms", "theater_date": "Jun 8, 2001", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$419.4K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Alma Mahler is flirting again.", "Sarah Wynter doesn't quite have the chops, Bruce Beresford doesn't quite have the heart, and the audience probably doesn't have anywhere near the level of interest.", "Never successfully answers what Alma Schindler had that drew composer Gustav Mahler, architect Walter Gropius, writer Franz Werfel, and painter Oskar Kokoschka to her.", "Beresford and his screenwriter, Marilyn Levy, have a wealth of compelling material at their disposal.
