{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Set on an American Army base in 1989, as the Berlin Wall is about to fall, \"Buffalo Soldiers\" takes a satiric look as these men steal, drink, fight, and make, take, and sell drugs. Elwood (Joaquin Phoenix) is the brains behind the operation, easily duping his superior (Ed Harris) and sleeping with his wife. But with the arrival of the new sergeant (Scott Glenn), everything changes. The sergeant cracks down; Elwood retaliates by dating his daughter and attempting a big weapons-for-drugs deal.", "rating": "73", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Gregor Jordan", "studio": "MiramaxFilms,FilmFour,GrosvenorParkProductions,GoodMachine,OdeonFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 23, 2016", "box_office": "$353.7K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["doing for the Cold War what Three Kings did for the first Gulf war - i.e. following the adventures of a small group of profiteering soldiers in order to satirise the self-interested smash-and-grab attitudes of US foreign policy.", "In the chaotic tradition of \"Dr. Strangelove\"...", "", "Buffalo Soldiers is like M*A*S*H for the Reagan/Bush era generation that never knew a war like Vietnam.
