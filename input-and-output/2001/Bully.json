You get the impression that the fascination with youth in his movies, just like in his photos, provides an excuse for voyeurism.", "A bit long and repetitive.", "An extremely disturbing tale of escalating peer pressure.", "'Bully' demands attention for the way in which it forces us to watch and digest a dark slice of American society. American beauty this ain't.", "hose involved in the real life story this film is based on should be disgusted -- for both sides were truly cheated out of the respect they deserved.", "Thanks, Larry Clark, for this festering little slice of suburban life: a perfect respite from 2001's summer of predictable Hollywood programming.", "A brutal, though darkly humorous film.", "Bully is a well-made film about an ugly incident.
