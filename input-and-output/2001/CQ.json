{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Paris, 1969. A director's obsession with the actress who plays the sexy secret agent Dragonfly (Angela Lindvall) has clouded his judgment and the film has no ending. A young American (Jeremy Davies), in Paris to document his life on film with total honesty, is brought in to finish the movie with a bang. This proves to be difficult when the line between his fantasy life and reality becomes blurred, and he too finds himself seduced by the charms of Dragonfly.", "rating": "66", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 31m", "director": "Roman Coppola", "studio": "SawyerProductions,LuxembourgFilmFund,UnitedArtists,DeluxProductions,AmericanZoetrope,CQProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 11, 2017", "box_office": "$411.0K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Coppola and his production team have taken meticulous care to faithfully copy the costumes, production designs, peek-a-boo sexiness and budget-crunched special effects of their source material.", "Coppola gives CQ a sense of style and humor that makes the navel-gazing bearable.", "", "", "", "There's nothing much to the film besides its pretty-coolness.
