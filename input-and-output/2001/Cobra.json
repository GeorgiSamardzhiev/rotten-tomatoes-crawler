[Blu-ray]", "...an exciting, blisteringly-paced actioner that benefits substantially from Sylvester Stallone's engrossing work as the title character.", "Every aspect of this film is reprehensible. Stallone's character is an empty hulk; the few attempts to provide us with little insights into his character are downright laughable.", "Cobra is a sleek, extremely violent and exciting police thriller.", "It's fast-paced and full of gaudy action, yet it's thoroughly unsatisfying, largely because it's so lazy.", "Sub-par Stallone shoot-em-up.", "The body count is only somewhere in the high eighties -- and most of these are simply gunned down with a deplorable lack of invention.", "", "Camp for adults.
