Although shallow and at times uneven, Saturday Night Live's ever-funny Chris Kattan as Corky, is an endearing goof-ball with a heart the size of Texas, guaranteed to make you smile.", "Eighth rate tired, unimaginative mob comedy.", "", "", "Unlike the pathetic protagonists of many a smart dumb comedy, Corky never becomes sympathetic, and without this fundamental irony the movie doesn't have a leg to stand on.", "Although Corky Romano is not based on a Saturday Night Live sketch, it is still as dismal.", "Unfortunately, keeping Kattan in the forefront is also one of the main problems with the film.", "Chris Kattan should have been in silent comedy. He has the Silly Putty face of those old slapstick stars, and a sing-song, splitting-headache vox box that would have played much better in the silents.", "Somebody, somewhere, actually believed in this dreck.", "...as Townes Van Zandt sang, \"Living's mostly wastin' time\" anyway.", "Will somebody please offer Peter Falk a decent role? This 'crotchety old geezer' gig is getting tiresome.", "Very, very bad.", "...the majority of the jokes are obvious and crude.", "Astonishingly unoriginal, unevenly paced and often just plain dumb, this is one comedy that could easily be reclassified as a tragedy -- particularly for Kattan.", "Stick with the website.", "...his new FBI name is Corky Pissant, pronounced just the way it sounds, and the rest of the humor in the movie doesn't get any better.", "...has a wacky side, but the wackiness does not tread outside the boundaries of the story.", "The film is merely a myopic footnote that cannot match its own nonsensical raucous tone.", "There's a difference between showmanship and showing off, and Kattan has not yet learned that.", "It's surprising some of the silliness actually elicits laughter. Not terribly surprising, however, is that there's not enough of that laughter."], "rating": ["", "2/5", "2/10", "1/4", "", "1/4", "2/5", "0.5/5", "1/5", "D", "", "", "2/4", "", "", "3/10", "2/4", "1.5/4", "0.5/4", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Debbie Lynn Elias", "Nell Minow", "Brian Orndorf", "Susan Stark", "Lisa Alspector", "Jeffrey Westhoff", "Kit Bowen", "Kimberley Jones", "John R.
