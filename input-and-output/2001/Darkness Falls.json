{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In Maine, the residents of Darkness Falls are all aware of the legend of Matilda Dixon, an old woman who was tragically murdered by a mob in the 1800s because the townspeople thought she was killing children. Now Darkness Falls has to contend with Matilda's supernatural wrath. Childhood friends Kyle (Chaney Kley) and Caitlin (Emma Caulfield) return home to uncover the truth behind the legend after Caitlin's little brother (Lee Cormie) has recurring nightmares about Matilda.", "rating": "9", "genre": "Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 25m", "director": "Jonathan Liebesman", "studio": "RevolutionStudios", "theater_date": "Jan 24, 2003", "dvd_date": "Mar 17, 2016", "box_office": "$32.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Obviously funding for this film was supplied by energy providers like Edison, DWP and PECO who must have known that one look at Darkness Falls will make everyone flick on the light switch - and it won't be to ward off the Tooth Fairy.", "The title refers to a town as well as a state of mind. Neither is worth a detour.", "It's only slightly more enjoyable than having army ants gnaw at your privates.", "", "So bad it's almost painful. Skip it.", "A very flawed but entertaining and cheesy monster flick that would be fun to watch around a crowd with some popcorn.", "Film lovers beware! The evil spirits of boredom will befall should you enter a darkened cinema and endure Darkness Falls.", "It begins with not one but two prologues; one character turns up out of nowhere, his introduction no doubt left on the cutting-room floor; and the paltry 85-minute running time includes 15 minutes of end credits.", "A mish mash of horror-movie clichs.", "The kind of movie that gets laughs entirely unintentionally.", "All semblance of plausibility is extracted, leaving a cast of TV actors to struggle with a plot with more gaps than an eight-year-old's grin.", "Exactly what a horror movie should be; fun, scary, fast paced, and with 'jump' moments galore.", "Oy, how it falls.", "This is, quite simply, horror porn, with barely any connective tissue linking each set piece.", "Provides for more than acceptable campfire fare (although at under 80 minutes, it lasts less than most Duralogs), with occasional moments of genuine visceral fright.", "The problem is that both the plot and the characters are so thin that it's hard to care about anything that's happening on screen.", "There are a few cheap scares, but overall the film is, well, toothless.", "You will find more frights in Finding Nemo.
