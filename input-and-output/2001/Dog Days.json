{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Summer in Vienna is the backdrop for intersecting anecdotes about six locals. Anna (Maria Hofst\u00e4tter), a compulsive hitchhiker, travels to shopping malls with strangers. A widower (Erich Finsches) asks a cleaning woman to strip for him. A divorced man and woman who still live together try to make each other miserable. A teacher (Christine Jirku) suffers violence at the hands of her boyfriend.
