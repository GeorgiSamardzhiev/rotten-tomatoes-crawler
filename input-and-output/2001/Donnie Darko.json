{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In a funny, moving and distinctly mind-bending journey through suburban America, one extraordinary but disenchanted teenager is about to take Time's Arrow for a ride. After surviving a freak accident, Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal) begins to explore what it means to be alive, and in short order to be in love, he uncovers secrets of the universe that give him a tempting power to alter time and destiny.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Comedy/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Richard Kelly", "studio": "GaylordFilms,PandoraCinema,AdamFieldsProductions,FlowerFilms", "theater_date": "Oct 26, 2001", "dvd_date": "Apr 25, 2017", "box_office": "$205.8K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Kelly adds to this central theme another of the topics that is constantly manifested throughout his work: the possibilities of the divine and the guilt of knowing those designs while we are alive.", "Every ounce of creativity is met with an equal serving of disappointing nebulousness.", "It's a dense, complicated and amazing amalgam of genres and influences that really defies any constraints.", "I certainly didn't have an emotional bond with the film. Still, I admire the risk taking and what it has to say about mental illness.", "It's ultimately the piece's surprisingly sincere, compassionate edge which transmits the most.", "[Richard] Kelly winds so many ideas, so many questions, and so much marvelously strange experience through this ambitious film that you can forgive the few loose ends and overdone caricatures amidst the richness.", "The theatrical version is some kind of compacted masterpiece, hormonal, vital, dazed, blissfully unhinged... I'm too attached to Donnie Darko to worry over its wanton weirdness, its mix of concreteness and intangibility.", "It remains an aesthetically filmed blend of off-beat comedy, mind-boggling sci-fi, and subjective storytelling that serves as a singular and timeless piece of cinema.", "Donnie Darko rightly made a star of Gyllenhaal.", "Gyllenhaal's breakthrough performance is simultaneously heartfelt, melancholy and mischievous.", "As pop as it is arthouse, as funny as it is tragic, Donnie Darko remains a remarkable one-off that's easy to adore.", "Complex, inventive, gripping, strange, and in the end deeply moving, with more ideas in it than Hollywood has produced in the entire last decade.", "An incredibly fascinating, star-making film that never fails to intrigue.", "Donnie Darko is a bit like a teenager: brooding, complex, rebellious, and difficult to comprehend.", "Defines itself through sustained mood, otherworldly intrigue and deep, abiding humanism.", "A decidedly weird time-travel drama that puzzled viewers so much that many went back to see it again and again... Unfortunately, Kelly's extended version diminishes the film's impact.", "Maybe Richard Kelly's fate is to be the cult-film circuit's Michael Cimino. He has yet to match the mood or magnitude of his debut - a collision of time-travel sci-fi, commentary on '80s malaise and teen angst that's simultaneously witty and poignant.", "A brilliant and truly incredible piece of art that deserves to be watched...", "", "The film...asks the question: what if the universe as we live it, not just as we theorize it, really isn't as we imagine it? In making the mundane as bottomless as the cosmic, Donnie Darko has the guts to remain a riddle itself."], "rating": ["4/5", "5/10", "4/4", "B", "4/5", "", "9/10", "8/10", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "", "9/10", "8/10", "A-", "", "4/4", "", "3/4", "A-"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Rafael Paz", "Mike Massie", "Erik Anderson", "Rachel Wagner", "PJ Nabarro", "Sean Axmaker", "Ray Pride", "Kyle Aaronson", "Tara Brady", "Simon Kinnear", "Jamie Dunn", "Anton Bitel", "R.L.
