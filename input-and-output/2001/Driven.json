British filmmakers Nick Hamm and Colin Bateman never quite make it feel like a California story, but they give the film a terrific disco vibe.", "Well-acted and well-made by British director Nick Hamm, although with familiar elements.", "Sudeikis, alas, is no Cruise and his screen persona is too lightweight to inject the film with genuine empathy or to make it anything other than a disposable teaser for the deeper, darker DeLorean drama that will inevitably follow.", "Unfortunately, the film's jaunty, comedic tone too often backfires, not helped by Sudeikis, who doesn't seem sure whether he is playing for laughs or not.", "The comic tone sits rather uneasily with this limited drama, and you wonder if going more blackly comic might have made this more engaging. As it is, this is mildly entertaining but largely forgettable.", "The film gives Pace a blank canvas on which to deploy more screen presence than everyone else combined, often just by directing a deep gaze in the general direction of the camera.", "Hamm and writer Colin Bateman are far too soft on everyone involved, presenting the two \"heroes\" as misguided innocents ensnared in a web of street crime and FBI corruption.", "Screenwriter and novelist Colin Bateman has here scripted a flashy but watchable true-crime thriller in the style of American Made (2017) or Blow (2001).", "Nick Hamm's period biopic attempts to turn this tall-sounding tale into American Hustle on wheels: alas, the results have all the dramatic horsepower of a mobility scooter.", "A crazy enough true story, written well enough to warrant attention, even if it doesn't quite deliver the emotional impact the story promises.", "Fans of hilarious hairpieces and outlandish acting are best served by the end result; anyone else can safely give this a miss.", "It's like someone got hold of all the wardrobe rejects from 'Boogie Nights' and built a movie around them.", "Jason Sudeikis is in the driver's seat throughout this film, not necessarily in a vehicle.He drives the comedy as well as the drama in every scene spouting high speed dialogue.", "An entertaining true-crime tale told with a wink and a smile."], "rating": ["3/5", "3.5/5", "4/5", "", "3/5", "4/5", "3.5/5", "3/5", "2/5", "2/5", "", "", "2/5", "3/5", "2/5", "3/5", "2/5", "2/5", "", "3.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tom Beasley", "Stephen Silver", "Amelia Harvey", "Mark Kermode", "Jamie East", "Stephen Carty", "Rich Cline", "Matthew Bond", "Kevin Maher", "Brian Viner", "James Bartlett", "Tim Hayes", "David Jenkins", "Peter Bradshaw", "Robbie Collin", "Rich Phippen", "Emma Simmonds", "Dave Calhoun", "Linda and Al Lerner", "Matthew Pejkovic"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">VultureHound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Splice Today", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Frame Rated", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Kermode &amp; Mayo&#39;s Film Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Sun (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Shadows on the Wall", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Mail on Sunday (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Mail (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Ireland Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sight and Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Little White Lies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">HeyUGuys", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The List", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies and Shakers", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Matt&#39;s Movie Reviews"], "date": ["August 16, 2020", "December 20, 2019", "December 1, 2019", "November 15, 2019", "November 12, 2019", "November 11, 2019", "November 11, 2019", "November 11, 2019", "November 11, 2019", "November 8, 2019", "November 8, 2019", "November 8, 2019", "November 8, 2019", "November 8, 2019", "November 7, 2019", "November 7, 2019", "November 5, 2019", "November 1, 2019", "September 9, 2019", "September 8, 2019"]}}
