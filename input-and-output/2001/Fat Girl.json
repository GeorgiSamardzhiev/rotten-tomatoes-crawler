{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Ana\u00efs is twelve and bears the weight of the world on her shoulders. She watches her older sister, Elena, whom she both loves and hates. Elena is fifteen and devilishly beautiful. Neither more futile, nor more stupid than her younger sister, she cannot understand that she is merely an object of desire. And, as such, she can only be taken. Or had. Indeed, this is the subject: a girl's loss of virginity. And, that summer, it opens a door to tragedy.", "rating": "73", "genre": "Art House & International/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 26m", "director": "Catherine Breillat", "studio": "ImmagineeCinema,CentreNationaldelaCinematographie,arteFranceCin\u00e9ma,Canal+,UraniaPicturesS.r.l.,CB(CatherineBreillat)Films,FlachFilm", "theater_date": "Oct 10, 2001", "dvd_date": "Jun 2, 2015", "box_office": "$724.1K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["While hardly enamored with Fat Girl, I was fine with it until its conclusion.", "From its tranquil beginning to its shocking finish, Fat Girl shows Breillat to be a world-class artist working at the top of her form -- even when the lessons of gender, sexuality and social custom may be hard to swallow.", "Far from being a mere provocateur (although she certainly is one), Breillat shines a light on the way everyday sexism degrades all concerned.", "I first saw this movie when I was 13 years old and it made me want to take a vow of celibacy. It is brutal and if seen at a formative age, inescapable.", "Like Breillat's debut feature (\"A Real Young Girl\") \"Fat Girl\" is a masterpiece awaiting inspection by audiences open to its meanings and insightful commentary.", "One of the most disturbing films I've ever seen.", "[Features a] shocking, ambiguous ending.", "", "", "I first saw Fat Girl upon its original US theatrical release in 2001.
