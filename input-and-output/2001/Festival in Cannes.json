{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Welcome to the sun-and-star-drenched shores of Cannes, France, where movie stars and wannabes, power brokers and voyeurs, hedonists and hopefuls, the glamorous and the infamous, come once a year on an obsessive quest: be it for the perfect role, the sweetest deal or quite simply love. Looking at three love stories - and three generations - \"Festival in Cannes\" reveals the sometimes glamorous, often duplicitous world of the haves and have-nots of the international movie business.", "rating": "65", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "Henry Jaglom", "studio": "RevereEntertainment,RainbowFilmCompany", "theater_date": "Mar 8, 2002", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$299.0K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["should be edited down to a 5-minute promotional trailer", "", "", "", "Those looking for a light and decidedly untraditional comedy will find some smart and witty exchanges within; those who consider Adam Sandler an underrated genius may be bored stiff.", "Henry Jaglom's lighthearted satire of Hollywood wheeler-dealers goes as far as the director is willing to bite...", "This is impressively carried off by a fine cast, particularly the luminous Aimee and Greta Scacchi whose career has intriguing parallels with those of the character she plays.", "Jaglom ... put[s] the audience in the privileged position of eavesdropping on his characters", "In the end, we don't see enough of Cannes and maybe too much of Kaz. But you have to accept or reject Jaglom as you might a walk on the Croisette, taking the bitter with the sweet.", "A picture as charmingly insubstantial as the world it invokes.", "The seaside splendor and shallow, beautiful people are nice to look at while you wait for the story to get going.", "The cast is so low-wattage that none of the characters comes off as big ... and the setting remains indistinct.", "Jaglom's latest is his most mature work to date, one with fresh insights into the people who decide what we experience at our cineplexes.", "At its best ... Festival in Cannes bubbles with the excitement of the festival in Cannes.", "A witty, trenchant, wildly unsentimental but flawed look at the ins and outs of modern moviemaking.", "May be Jaglom at his most self-serving and self-righteous.", "Jaglom offers the none-too-original premise that everyone involved with moviemaking is a con artist and a liar.", "The kind of sweet-and-sour insider movie that film buffs will eat up like so much gelati.", "The actors are simply too good, and the story too intriguing, for technical flaws to get in the way.", "One of [Jaglom's] better efforts -- a wry and sometime bitter movie about love."], "rating": ["D", "2/5", "1/5", "4/4", "7", "C", "", "A", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "3/5", "1/4", "", "3/5", "3/4", "2/4", "2/4", "3/4", "3/4", "3/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["John A.
