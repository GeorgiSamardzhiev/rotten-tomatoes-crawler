{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Hong Kong superstar Andy Lau re-teams with directors Johnnie To (\"The Mission\") and Wa Ka Fai for a spectacular no holds barred cinematic extravaganza.

[Full Review in Spanish]", "An intelligent, wellconstructed emotional thriller with added gunplay, it delivers a pleasurable blend of mischief and mayhem.", "Full of visual and verbal references to action and noir favorites, but burdened by a knotty story line and existential dialogue about fateful coincidences, it has trouble locating its own emotional core.", "", "Strangely dull.", "The movie should be building to a stunning conclusion, but somehow it loses momentum.", "", "", "", "There's very little sense to what's going on here, but the makers serve up the cliches with considerable dash.", "So what is the point? Lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland, basically.", "The dreamy flow back and forth through time and memory and the shifting point of view across four narrators casts the sleek stylistics of 21st-century Hong Kong cinema between tortured existential heroics and tall tale.", "Manages to be original, even though it rips off many of its ideas.", "Fans of the modern day Hong Kong action film finally have the worthy successor to A Better Tomorrow and The Killer which they have been patiently waiting for.", "Killer has killer style, but it ain't worth killing two hours of your life on it.", "There's a fine chemistry of contrasts between Lau's exuberance and the quiet, slow-burning intensity Takashi Sorimachi brings to his role.", "The movie's something-borrowed construction feels less the product of loving, well integrated homage and more like a mere excuse for the wan, thinly sketched story. Killing time, that's all that's going on here.", "No, it's not nearly as good as any of its influences.", "Together, Tok and O orchestrate a buoyant, darkly funny dance of death. In the process, they demonstrate that there's still a lot of life in Hong Kong cinema.", "There's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references, but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening."], "rating": ["", "", "", "2.5/5", "2/5", "2.5/4", "4/5", "3/4", "3/5", "B-", "2.5/4", "B+", "B", "A+", "C-", "", "C-", "2/4", "3.5/4", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Alberto Abu\u00edn", "Alexander Walker", "Ted Shen", "", "Jurgen Fauth", "Ian Mantgani", "Justin Bowyer", "Peter Kenis", "Jamie Russell", "Frank Swietek", "Ty Burr", "Sean Axmaker", "Gary Dowell", "Edward Havens", "E!
