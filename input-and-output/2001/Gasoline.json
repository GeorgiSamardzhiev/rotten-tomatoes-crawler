The film is set in a particularly bleak urban landscape and has plenty of noir elements and edge, visually speaking, but the story is ridiculous.", "[Director Monica] Stambrini drapes the film in a cultural scramble-suit.", "By the time Lenni's and Stella's story has played out, the writers must have laid down their pens with a sigh.
