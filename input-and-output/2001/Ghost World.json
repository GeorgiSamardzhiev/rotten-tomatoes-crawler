{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The story of neo-cool Enid (Thora Birch) and Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson) who, faced with graduation from high school, take a hard look at the world they wryly observe and decide what they really want. When Enid takes an interest in the offbeat Seymour (Steve Buscemi) and Rebecca focuses her attention on their mutual romantic fixation Josh (Brad Renfro), the girls' friendship is forever changed.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Terry Zwigoff", "studio": "JerseyFilms,UnitedArtists", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2016", "box_office": "$6.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Zwigoff's portrait of adolescent alienation commands a potent portrait of interiority as concerns its lonely souls searching for likeminded personalities within a superficial void.", "An elegy to the rebellious Gen X dream, and a crash course in existence for all 18-year-olds who followed.", "We care about these characters and, despite themselves, they care for one another, too. Irony meets empathy here and both are better for it.", "That is part of its magic and its beauty, I think - its ability to speak to and for those who don't quite feel at home in mainstream society.", "Ghost World is animated by a tension between Seymour's 78 rpm universe and Enid's dedication to a punk etho", "A blend of old and new leaves the film with a timeless feel, one that emphasizes that no matter what significant changes society undergoes people are pretty much the same.", "Ghost World is very funny but also very perceptive, and it offers Steve Buscemi one of the defining roles of his career.", "The greatest distinction of \"Ghost World\" is its singular spirit. Here's a dark, deadpan comedy about alienated kids that manages to be smart, surpassingly odd, extremely funny and mysteriously endearing at the same time.", "While this isn't a showy or flashy movie, it has social, psychological, and ultimately mystical overtones that raise it leagues above most other teen-centered comedies.", "The modest yet redeeming triumph of Ghost World is the offhand way it brings to the screen a streak of American dark humor that is dour, resilient and unexpectedly infectious.", "See it for Birch's hostile stare and Johansson's devastating monotone.", "A top draw adaptation of a cracking comic-book.", "Like \"Rushmore\" with a female slant, \"Ghost World\" tackles the true torches we often keep to ourselves as well as the struggle of feeling like a specter, or, as Enid says, as though \"everyone's too stupid to realize you.\"", "Most of Ghost World is funny, but the laughs are inextricably tied to the painful alienation and self-loathing that comes with living on society's fringes.", "By sharp turns poignant, disturbing and hysterically funny.", "...satisfying in ways that more than compensate for the film's soft ending.", "Has some grade A talent behind it, but it lacks any of the heart or emotion of the coming of age brand the film aspires toward...", "If more people appreciated stories like this, movies and comic books would be better off.", "Anyone who grew up in the suburbs or ever felt out of place will find something to relate to in this film.", "his is 'teen comedy' of startling sophistication -- with horribly funny bits as well.
