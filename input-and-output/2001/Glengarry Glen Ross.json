{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When an office full of New York City real estate salesmen is given the news that all but the top two will be fired at the end of the week, the atmosphere begins to heat up. Shelley Levene (Jack Lemmon), who has a sick daughter, does everything in his power to get better leads from his boss, John Williamson (Kevin Spacey), but to no avail. When his coworker Dave Moss (Ed Harris) comes up with a plan to steal the leads, things get complicated for the tough-talking salesmen.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "James Foley", "studio": "NewLineCinema,GGR,ZupnikCinemaGroupII", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 17, 2015", "box_office": "$10.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Clearly some of the best work that the likes of Al Pacino, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, Alec Baldwin, and even the great Jack Lemmon, have ever done.", "While the dark view of human nature and brutal dialogue might keep faint hearts from the film, the cast manages to individualize and humanize the pugilistic wordplay so that its expressiveness never veers into offensiveness.", "Not an enjoyable watch, but in its own way it is exhilarating.", "As an expression of a great script, it really can't be beat.", "Head of the direction duties, James Foley, strings it together well, making it harmonise like the musical piece it has succeeded to be.", "As you would expect from a Mamet play, the dialogue sizzles.", "...the most effective big-screen translation of a Mamet stage play.", "The overall film, writing and acting are so darn good that I watched it and then immediately started it over again.", "For anyone who loves sharp dialogue, compelling characters, and a stinging social rebuke, Glengarry Glen Ross is not to be missed.", "Mamet reveals his exceptional talent for writing almost poetic working-class vernacular, scores his major implicit thematic thrusts against the nature of the way business-at-large is conducted.", "Mamet has a special gift for drawing portriats of lowlifers who are harsh but also funny, his salesmen are a far cry from Arthur Miller's Loman in Death of a Salesman.", "David Mamet's play about the wheelings and dealings of real-estate salesmen gets dedicated playing from a splendid cast, but gains nothing by the transfer from stage to screen.", "This brilliant, gutsy film features a nervy script by David Mamet and career-topping performances by Jack Lemmon, Al Pacino, Alan Arkin, Ed Harris, Kevin Spacey, Jonathan Pryce and Alec Baldwin.", "As fierce as it is funny.
