{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Music legend Mariah Carey makes her feature film debut in this love story set against the backdrop of the New York club scene.

This is what she does best. This is what she should stick to. Save your money and watch her videos for free on cable music-television networks.", "A guilty pleasure.", "Heroically bad.", "This fails to convince on several levels: Carey's assumed edginess; Beesley's faltering Brooklyn accent; turns from such celebs as rapper Da Brat and soul vocalist Eric Benet; the half-hearted '80s references and the haphazard retro effects.", "Mariah Carey should have taken an acting class from Marky Mark Wahlberg. The first lesson: start small.", "It was almost physically uncomfortable watching the performances in Glitter.", "Glitter lacks sparkle.", "your standard-issue \"I turned around and I was famous\" melodrama, set in an implausibly wholesome-looking 1983 club world, where most of the folks dress oddly, but generally are just about as nice as pie.", "If nothing else, at least it killed a career. Max Beesely looks like a porno Luke Skywalker...The Shaggs had more talent.", "It's so badly botched that it's entertaining ... for all the wrong reasons.", "If poor Mariah Carey suffered a well-publicized breakdown prior to the release of this disposable display, imagine what she'll feel like to learn that she may have appeared in one of the worst ill-advised pointless flicks of the year.", "So blatantly takes every bit of its formula to the furthermost extremes, it becomes a comedy.", "Though unintentional laughs are there to be had ...
