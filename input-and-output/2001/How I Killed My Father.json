{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Jean-Luc (Charles Berling), a successful geriatrician, enjoys a comfortable life with his wife, Isa (Natacha R\u00e9gnier). He is shocked to learn that his father, Maurice (Michel Bouquet), who had abandoned the family years earlier, has died in Africa -- and is even more shocked when Maurice shows up a short time later at his house. Without explaining his presence, Maurice insinuates himself into his son's life, charming Isa but bringing Jean-Luc's buried resentment to the surface.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "Anne Fontaine", "studio": "Cin\u00e9B", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$145.4K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "", "Vet French actor Michel Bouquet renders such an astounding performance that he elevates Anne Fontaine's family melodrama way above its Freudian foundations and male menopause.", "Hushed but scalpel-sharp drama, a movie that'll probably send men in the audience home much quieter than they arrived.", "A bela construo de personagens merece elogios.", "Brilliantly and pitilessly dissects a father-son relationship that has deteriorated beyond dysfunction.", "Whether writer-director Anne Fontaine's film is a ghost story, an account of a nervous breakdown, a trip down memory lane, all three or none of the above, it is as seductive as it is haunting.", "Watching these two actors play against each other so intensely, but with restraint, is a treat.", "A chilly, brooding but quietly resonant psychological study of domestic tension and unhappiness.", "Sad, yet interesting.", "Trs French, trs fascinating psychodrama.", "This is a fascinating film because there is no clear-cut hero and no all-out villain.", "How I Killed My Father would be a rarity in Hollywood. It's an actor's showcase that accomplishes its primary goal without the use of special effects, but rather by emphasizing the characters -- including the supporting ones.", "This is a harrowing movie about how parents know where all the buttons are, and how to push them.", "Cold, nervy and memorable.", "The film is about the relationships rather than about the outcome.
