{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Federico (Eusebio Poncela) has a rather unique talent: he can steal the luck of others. For Samuel Berg (Max von Sydow), who runs a lavish casino, that makes him a prized employee. But when Samuel turns the tables and steals Federico's luck, it sets the two at war. Samuel is one of the luckiest people in the world; to get at him, Federico has to find someone even luckier. He finds a candidate in Tomas (Leonardo Sbaraglia), a plane crash survivor who, if he's lucky, might just even the odds.", "rating": "72", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Juan Carlos Fresnadillo", "studio": "Sogecine", "theater_date": "Dec 13, 2002", "dvd_date": "Mar 1, 2017", "box_office": "$302.7K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "While it runs a bit slow, Intacto doesn't bore, and the ending is interesting to see played out, if not a bit predictable.", "", "", "one of those European genre films that look much superior to Hollywood even when they are obviously below the standards of genre excellence", "", "Rarely is a film about the supernatural as thoughtful and affecting as Intacto; even more rarely does that kind of film attract an audience.", "Though at times the rules of this luck-stealing underworld aren't exactly clear, and the plot becomes a bit mired in its own cleverness, Intacto is an intriguing notion.", "I got a headache watching this meaningless downer.", "Like a sprinter competing in his first distance race: It bursts forth with tremendous energy, sustains itself for quite a while, loses steam near the end but finishes ahead of most of the pack.", "Fresnadillo has something serious to say about the ways in which extravagant chance can distort our perspective and throw us off the path of good sense.", "The movie doesn't generate a lot of energy.
