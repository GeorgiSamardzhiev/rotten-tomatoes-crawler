{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Featuring stop-motion animation and live action, this inventive adaptation of Roald Dahl's beloved children's tale follows the adventures of James (Paul Terry), an orphaned young British boy. Forced to live with his cruel aunts (Joanna Lumley, Miriam Margolyes), James finds a way out of his bleak existence when he discovers an enormous enchanted peach. After rolling into the sea inside the buoyant fruit, James, accompanied by a crew of friendly talking insects, sets sail for New York City.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Animation/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 20m", "director": "Henry Selick", "studio": "WaltDisneyPictures,SkellingtonProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 13, 2015", "box_office": "$28.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...valiantly attempts to convey the amazement and childlike sense-of-wonder so characteristic of the late Dahl's books, and while it does succeed occasionally, more often than not it falls flat.", "Dahl himself thought his book would be impossible to translate into film, and for all the ingenuity that's been thrown at the screen, perhaps he was right. This overgrown peach never ripens.", "The film is a technical tour de force, featuring a wealth of inventive design ideas. But James never develops the emotional dimension that Nightmare possessed.", "A snappy, fun adaptation that entertains young viewers without speaking down to them.", "This film adaptation of his James and the Giant Peach, though capturing Dahl's comic brilliance, does not shy away from the tale's surreal grimness.", "As a tribute to the cranky genius of Dahl, it's both fond and, in the best sense, fruitful.", "A truly sinister fairy story laced with bizarre characters -- both live-action and animated -- James and the Giant Peach from Walt Disney Pictures is a stunning, if not markedly macabre, adaptation of author Roald Dahl's best-selling 1961 book.", "A brief nightmare sequence, which appears to be some sort of hallucinatory blend of collage and live action, is simply one of the greatest bits of animation I've ever seen.", "Ultimately, though, it isn't nearly as flavorful as Roald Dahl's deliciously perverse children's book, upon which the movie is based.", "This movie remembers what fun is.", "James and the Giant Peach shines with weird, whimsical invention.", "Another superb stop-action animated film from the same team responsible for Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas.", "One of the brightest, giddiest and most outlandishly exciting of all the Disney Studio's recent major feature cartoons.", "James and the Giant Peach proves the best effects are even better with a strong story.", "The fantasy is almost too inventive for its own good.", "It's Joanna Lumley and Miriam Margolyes as the ghastly Spiker and Sponge who steal this wonderfully pantomimic show.", "It was a bold choice to mix live-action and stop-motion, and it's not something you'd see today given the pervasiveness of CGI.", "At its lyrical best, James and the Giant Peach, an adaptation of Roald Dahl's 1961 children's classic, evokes the casual enchantment of a book that, for many kids (including me), cast the spell of a goofily blissed-out mirage.", "", "Fabulous adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic book."], "rating": ["C", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "3/4", "4/5", "3.5/5", "B", "7", "4/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Zaki Hasan", "David Ansen", "Dave Kehr", "Jeff Strickler", "Chris Wright", "Anthony Lane", "Roger Hurlburt", "Tom Gliatto", "Chris Kridler", "Jay Boyar", "Steven Rea", "Gene Siskel", "Michael Wilmington", "Doug Thomas", "David Sterritt", "David Parkinson", "Kevin Carr", "Owen Gleiberman", "Dan Jardine", "Heather Boerner"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Zaki&#39;s Corner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Minneapolis Star Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Phoenix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">7M Pictures", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Apollo Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media"], "date": ["April 12, 2019", "February 23, 2018", "November 11, 2014", "November 11, 2014", "November 11, 2014", "November 18, 2013", "November 18, 2013", "November 18, 2013", "November 18, 2013", "November 18, 2013", "November 18, 2013", "November 18, 2013", "November 18, 2013", "November 18, 2013", "November 18, 2013", "November 18, 2013", "August 1, 2012", "September 7, 2011", "April 4, 2011", "December 18, 2010"]}}
