{"metadata": {"synopsis": "He's the wrong person, at the wrong place, at the wrong time. Joe Dirt (David Spade) is a janitor with a mullet hairdo, acid-washed jeans and a dream -- to find the parents that he lost at the Grand Canyon when he was eight. As his wandering, misguided search takes him from one misadventure to another, he finds his way to Los Angeles, where a shock-jock (Dennis Miller) brings Joe on the radio to insult him. But as Joe's story unfolds, jeers turn to cheers, and an entire city is captivated.", "rating": "10", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Dennie Gordon", "studio": "ColumbiaPictures,HappyMadisonProductions", "theater_date": "Apr 11, 2001", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$27.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["In place of anything resembling a plot, the movie wheels-out a tired collection of set-piece gross-outs for Joe to endure.", "Crass, formulaic comedy with bullying, cartoonish violence.", "", "Contrived yet unpretentious, predictable yet surprising, this underdog comedy and its title character have considerable charm.", "...none of it is funny.", "Nothing written here will stop this film from being a huge hit, but don't say you weren't warned.", "Sally forth, gentle viewer, and enjoy yourself. En route, you will experience a steady supply of doo-doo jokes, dispensed in seven-minute intervals by the Script-O-Tron 3000TM.", "With its quirky characters, silly sight gags, and the tasteless humor that has become a staple among teen comedies of late, this film will not fail to amuse its market.", "The juvenile humor, however, is not so much a miscalculation as simple overkill.", "", "Joe is often ridiculous and rather dumb, but there's a sweetness to him.", "like watching a talentless stand-up struggling through Open Mike Night, inspiring catcalls instead of laughs and bringing on lethargy instead of levity.", "A comic named David Spade stars in a movie called Joe Dirt, and that's about as funny as things get here.", "It's not likely to be remembered come Oscar time...but if you find yourself laughing at your own flatulence from time to time, you might find some solid giggles.", "While Spade did succeed in winning my sympathy, it wasn't worth sitting through all those bad jokes and weak comedy sketches to get to that point.", "Check the pedigree of this film first and you may want to proceed no further.", "\"not a great movie by any means, (but) an amusing way to pass the time.\"", "There's no mistaking that you'll get anything other than entertainment of the lowest brow.", "It seems to be a movie made by people using controlled substances for audiences also under the influence.
