{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Josie (Rachael Leigh Cook), Melody (Tara Reid) and Val (Rosario Dawson) are three small-town girl musicians determined to take their rock band out of their garage and straight to the top, while remaining true to their look, style and sound. They get a record deal which brings fame and fortune but soon realize they are pawns of two people who want to control the youth of America. They must clear their names, even if it means losing fame and fortune.", "rating": "53", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Deborah Kaplan, Harry Elfont", "studio": "MarcPlattProductions,RiverdaleProductions", "theater_date": "Apr 11, 2001", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$14.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's a silly film, yes, but it also served as a critical commentary to the culture of the early aughts.", "Actually, it's the dialogue that's jerkin'. The script has a stilted feel, and its funny lines aren't really funny, so that the actors have to stand there and declaim them as if thereby officially designating them as funny.", "Not a great movie, but it's a solid musical comedy with some guaranteed chuckles, a great cast, and an admirable wit.", "Movie rates itself out of an ideal audience.", "Ranks a 'one' next to Spinal Tap's '11'.", "The sour notes are all in a dumbed-down script, canned-ham performances that soon wear thin.", "This self-styled self-reflexive comedy asks the question, just how stupid are teenagers?", "This is one sharp pussycat.", "Aaaaah, what a classic!", "Scratch this one off your must-see list.", "Boasts a self-referential irreverence that gleefully attacks pop culture by using members of pop culture", "Alan Cumming (who's picked up where Richard E. Grant left off in Spice World) seems to be doing an impression of Stewie, the megalomaniacal baby on Family Guy.", "Once again the nostalgia of our youth has been strip-mined for a Hollywood remake . . . At least this one doesn't have any CGI talking-dog monstrosities in it", "About as fresh and fun as week-old kitty litter.", "The best praise I can offer is it could have been worse.", "Not necessarily the best film, those who remember the original series and have an interest in pop culture humor should find something in Josie to enjoy.", "In the end, the plot is revealed and everything is wrapped up just like an episode of Scooby Doo. But not after the bumbling Tara Reid tortures us with her ditziness.", "Josie and the Pussycats moves like one of its songs, fast, sexy, and fun.", "Amusing comedy that transcends its all-too-obvious silliness thanks to a trio of sweet performances, some catchy songs and some spot-on gags at the expense of teen culture.", "Send the teens to this one.
