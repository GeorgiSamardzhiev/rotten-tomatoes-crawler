{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Renato (Ugo Tognazzi) and Albin (Michel Serrault) are happy that their son, Laurent (R\u00e9mi Laurent), is getting married. Unfortunately, the bride's father (Michel Galabru) is a die-hard conservative -- and Renato and Albin are rather conspicuously gay. To ensure that the marriage goes off without a hitch, Albin uses his skills as a drag performer to play mom for a meeting with the in-laws. But, before long, both men learn that playing it straight isn't as easy as it seems!", "rating": "95", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 31m", "director": "Edouard Molinaro", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 30, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's clear that if it hadn't been for the work of the actors, the satire and possible critique would have vanished in an instant.

Though pokily staged up to its final act, it manages some real laughs.", "Renato and Albin shared the same hopes and fears as heterosexual parents and (were) both willing to sacrifice anything for the sake of their child.", "At once dated and timeless.", "Fun & gay, literally, based on hit Broadway show.", "", "Of all the versions, imitations, and sequels, the first 1978 French picture is the best and funniest, a fresh look at machoism and drag queens; the gay couple is superb.", "", "", "The comic turns in the plot are achieved with such clockwork timing that sometimes we're laughing at what's funny and sometimes we're just laughing at the movie's sheer comic invention.
