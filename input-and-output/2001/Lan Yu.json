{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Beijing, 1988. On the cusp of middle age, Chen Handong (Hu Jun) has known little but success all his life. The eldest son of a senior government bureaucrat, he heads a fast-growing trading company and plays as hard as he works. Few know that Handong's tastes run more to boys than girls. Chen develops a relationship with a young boy named Lan Yu (Ye Liu) that goes farther than he ever wanted it to.", "rating": "67", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 27m", "director": "Stanley Kwan Kam-Pang", "studio": "YongningCreationWorkshop", "theater_date": "Nov 22, 2001", "dvd_date": "Mar 1, 2007", "box_office": "$116.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's a wise, moving love story--marred only by a rather arbitrary twist of fate at the end--played out with an emotional honesty that would be unusual and adventurous in any language.", "This film takes the Tienanmen massacre as its subtle backdrop, so subtle that it all happens though sounds heard off-screen.", "A gay love story based on an anonymous Internet novel.", "", "", "", "", "The characters seem one-dimensional, and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience.", "Seems like something American and European gay movies were doing 20 years ago.", "Hu and Liu offer natural, matter-of-fact performances that glint with sorrow, longing and love.", "This delicately observed story, deeply felt and masterfully stylized, is a triumph for its maverick director.", "A nicely constructed film with an unusual, though not unheard-of theme for Chinese cinema.", "Lan Yu is a genuine love story, full of traditional layers of awakening and ripening and separation and recovery.", "The movie is gorgeously made, but it is also somewhat shallow and art-conscious.", "It's probably worth catching solely on its visual merits. If only it had the story to match.", "It's a lovely, sad dance highlighted by Kwan's unique directing style.", "Assured, vital and well wrought, the film is, arguably, the most accomplished work to date from Hong Kong's versatile Stanley Kwan.", "The very simple story seems too simple and the working out of the plot almost arbitrary.", "A beautifully crafted love story that should stand as a career breakthrough for the subtle Hong Kong stylist Stanley Kwan.", "In the end, we are left with something like two ships passing in the night rather than any insights into gay love, Chinese society or the price one pays for being dishonest."], "rating": ["", "B+", "B", "3/5", "2/5", "4/5", "C", "2/4", "2.5/4", "3/4", "3/5", "", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "2/4", "", "4/5", "", "", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Ansen", "Jason Gorber", "Dennis Schwartz", "", "Emanuel Levy", "Greg Muskewitz", "Eric D.
