{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Fred Schepisi's thoughtful ensemble drama looks back on the life of Jack (Michael Caine), an amiable London butcher who leaves behind his devoted wife, Amy (Helen Mirren), and a group of loyal pub-dwelling buddies when he dies. Charged with bringing his ashes to the sea, Ray (Bob Hoskins), Lenny (David Hemmings) and Vic (Tom Courtenay) make their way to the ocean with Jack's foster son, Vince (Ray Winstone), fondly remembering their old friend along the way.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Fred Schepisi", "studio": "WinchesterFilms", "theater_date": "Feb 15, 2002", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$2.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "Schepisi always handles actors sympathetically and here he has a perfect cast, most of whom can draw on their own and their parents' experiences.", "Delicately handled and superbly textured, this fine adaptation of Graham Swift's Booker Prize-winning novel deals with all the really big subjects: love, friendship, death, life.", "[A] classy but dry, lackluster trip down memory lane...", "Ambitious in structure and casting, it packs a lot into its screen time. Quality craftsmanship for a discerning crowd.", "One of the most rewarding and authentic depictions of/tributes to the Cockney way of life in recent years.", "By film's end one feels as if they have indeed taken a long trip with these people -- and along the way has grown to know and care about them.", "", "'Last Orders' has class stamped all over it.", "By film's end one feels as if they have indeed taken a long trip with these people -- and along the way has grown to know and care about them.", "Fred Schepisi's latest film is based on Graham Swift's Booker prize-winning novel and has a great cast, but is ultimately rather slow moving and dull.", "Old people will love this movie, and I mean that in the nicest possible way: Last Orders will touch the heart of anyone old enough to have earned a 50-year friendship.", "Fred Schepisi's tale of four Englishmen facing the prospect of their own mortality views youthful affluence not as a lost ideal but a starting point.", "Gathering its forces slowly, this careful, thoughtful film, quietly but deeply moving, is dramatic without seeming to be.", "You'd think a movie with Bob Hoskins, Michael Caine, Helen Mirren and Tom Courtenay couldn't be all bad, but you'd be wrong.", "A movie I loved on first sight and, even more important, love in remembrance.", "Last Orders nurtures the multi-layers of its characters, allowing us to remember that life's ultimately a gamble and last orders are to be embraced. It's affecting, amusing, sad and reflective.", "Portrays the unvarnished nature of friendships: mean and spiteful, petty and begrudging, needy and loving.", "A beautiful movie about everyday people that seem so real they could be your neighbors. It's like being invited round to the pub for a couple of pints with some mates.", "Schepisi has never made a better film, and if he never makes one anywhere nearly this good again, this more than justifies the occasional clinker in his filmography."], "rating": ["B", "", "", "2/5", "4/5", "", "3.5/5", "2.5/4", "5/5", "3/4", "2/5", "4.5/5", "", "4/5", "", "4/4", "", "4/5", "3.5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Emanuel Levy", "Philip French", "David Stratton", "Mark Halverson", "Alan Morrison", "Geoff Andrew", "Michael Dequina", "Susan Tavernetti", "Tom Grealis", "Michael Dequina", "Matthew Turner", "Scott Weinberg", "Mark Palermo", "Kenneth Turan", "Jason Clark", "Michael Wilmington", "Urban Cinefile Critics", "Jeffrey Bruner", "Cherryl Dawson and Leigh Ann Palone", "Ken Hanke"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sacramento News &amp; Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Palo Alto Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">RT\u00c9 (Ireland)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieReport.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ViewLondon", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Coast (Halifax, Nova Scotia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Matinee Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Urban Cinefile", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Des Moines Register", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieChicks.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)"], "date": ["January 17, 2013", "October 11, 2010", "March 27, 2009", "August 7, 2008", "December 30, 2006", "February 9, 2006", "December 11, 2004", "May 20, 2003", "February 13, 2003", "December 8, 2002", "October 30, 2002", "August 28, 2002", "August 22, 2002", "August 15, 2002", "August 11, 2002", "July 20, 2002", "July 4, 2002", "June 7, 2002", "June 7, 2002", "June 5, 2002"]}}
