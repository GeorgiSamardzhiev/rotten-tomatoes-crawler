{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A comedy about two hapless best friends who are plunged headlong into the world of organized crime. When Bobby (Jon Favreau) and Ricky (Vince Vaughn) accept a high-stakes delivery, the clueless duo is flown first-class to New York and thrust into the moneyed world of Ruiz (Sean Combs), a downtown Manhattan gangster. In a matter of hours, Ricky's delusions of grandeur unravel the entire operation and put both his and Bobby's lives in jeopardy.", "rating": "71", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 34m", "director": "Jon Favreau", "studio": "CardiffGiantProductions", "theater_date": "Jul 13, 2001", "dvd_date": "Sep 9, 2015", "box_office": "$5.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Slick suits, hip urban nightspots, and an over the top performance by Vince Vaughn make this rambunctious farce an enjoyable and unpredictable movie with some obligatory fist fighting.", "A joyless experience with an often irritating, bland, and pointless movie.", "Vaughn hits the bullseye as a strident, volatile jerk who can't keep his mouth shut. You never really like him, but you can't wait to see what he'll do next -- his missteps and offenses are so unbelievable you wince, but you can't look away.", "Unfortunately, Vaughn repeatedly crosses the line between persuasively playing an obnoxious character and coming across as nerve-gratingly self-indulgent.", "Difficult Second Movie hurdle negotiated. Just.", "The same offbeat sensibility that informed Swingers is also evident here, except that unlike the 1996 film, which dealt with real issues, Favreau's new crime-comedy is plotless", "If the film's too ready to go with the flow of Chris Doyle's handheld camerawork, and sometimes seems ad hoc, its spot-on attention to the faux pas of the moment certainly raises a smile.", "A picture that may not end up with the fervent following of its flashier predecessor, but one that merits a viewing.", "Swingers fans beware.", "The film isn't as clever as Swingers but it boasts enough witty dialogue to make it entertaining.", "The plot seems to be nothing more than a translucent bridge to the next scene where Vaughn can run his mouth and Favreau can play off him as the longsuffering friend", "As with 'Swingers' before it, the sparkling chemistry between Favreau and Vaughn is undoubtedly the highlight of 'Made'.", "Well-written and well-acted, though your enjoyment will largely depend on how high your Vince Vaughn tolerance level is.", "The script is nicely seasoned with jokes and surprise twists (right up to a contrived sentimental ending), and the two lead actors plunge into their roles with contagious enthusiasm.", "As witty as Favreau's dialogue is and as engaging as the look and tone he gives the film are, I think what's most admirable is how generous he is with his cast.", "Made should be much funnier than it is, although I enjoyed the permanent fizzing of its humour on an internal level.", "There's a not-so-subtle attempt at rekindling the charisma Favreau and Vaughn showed in Swingers, and for the most part the effort succeeds.", "Most amazing is that Favreau not only keeps things hilarious even at their darkest, but he plays it all for keeps. There's not a \"hip\" or glib moment in the whole picture.", "Doesn't know when to step on the brakes before it turns itself in to a one-note shtick movie.", "Favreau and Vaughn retain the ad-libbed give-and-take that sparkled in \"Swingers.\""], "rating": ["B", "1/4", "4/5", "", "3/5", "C+", "", "3.5/5", "2/4", "", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3/4", "3.5/4", "", "3/4", "", "4/10", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Cole Smithey", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Stacie Hougland", "Joe Leydon", "", "Emanuel Levy", "Derek Adams", "Michael Dequina", "Jeanne Aufmuth", "Wilson Morales", "Brian Mckay", "Tom Grealis", "Matthew Turner", "Margaret A.
