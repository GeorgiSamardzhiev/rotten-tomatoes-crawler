{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Angela de Marco (Michelle Pfeiffer) is fed up with her gangster husband's (Alec Baldwin) line of work and wants no part of the crime world. When her husband is killed for having an affair with the mistress of mob boss Tony \"The Tiger\" Russo (Dean Stockwell), Angela and her son depart for New York City to make a fresh start. Unfortunately, Tony has set his sights upon Angela -- and so has an undercover FBI agent (Matthew Modine) looking to use her to bust Tony.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Jonathan Demme", "studio": "OrionPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 2, 2016", "box_office": "$19.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Demme sees corruption-the potential for it and the indulgence of it-in everyone. Yet he doesn't neglect the humanity of the people in thrall to or trapped within those systems.", "It's a tonal gymnastics display that doesn't come around very often, making \"Married to the Mob\" special, assisted in great part by Demme's askew vision for this type of story.", "The cast is superb - especially Mercedes Ruehl in over-the-top mode as Stockwell's brassy, jealous wife - and Demme keeps both the action and the laughs perfectly tuned.", "The results are very good - far better and funnier than most of what is being made these days.", "It's good for a few chuckles, but no real laughs, and the predictable plot is not very compelling.", "Demme makes crystal-clear what some have suspected for quite a while: that there are few more luxurious movie pleasures than watching Michelle Pfeiffer when she's given a role worthy of her.", "\"Married to the Mob'' isn't for all tastes. But for cinematic thrills and spills, it's quite a ride.", "High-spirited and hilarious, Mob supplies that special kick you get from movie comedy when laughter bubbles over into bliss.", "Demme's narrative has all the frantic intensity of a nightmare which with its constant shifts of pace and mood works beautifully both as a thriller and as comedy.", "...a top-tier '80s comedy.", "If you're in the mood for mafia comedy with laughs and a rebellious women's viewpoint, check out Married to the Mob on tape or cable.", "This is gangster life played for screwball comedy but the culture isn't all that different than what Martin Scorsese would present in Goodfellas just a couple of years later, right down to the colorful names like Vinnie The Slug...", "Married to the Mob is full of promise, but goes nowhere, apparently satisfied enough with being avant-garde and hip.", "Offbeat genial suburban gangster comedy delightfully directed by Jonathan Demme.", "A gangster film with a twist and the idiosyncratic Demme touch.", "Pfeiffer is at her best, and there's plenty of action, although you may feel that some of the gags involving a scorned and vengeful wife (Mercedes Ruehl) are a bit shopworn.", "A fluffy but entertaining comedy.", "A lot of fun to watch, thanks to a darn sturdy cast and a director with a sublime ability to make fluff seem deeper than it really is.", "The enormous cast is a total delight, starting with Pfeiffer, with hair dyed dark, a New York accent and a continuously nervous edge.", "Irresistible"], "rating": ["", "A-", "4/5", "3/4", "2/5", "", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "B-", "3.5/4", "", "", "7/10", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Keith Uhlich", "Brian Orndorf", "Jo Berry", "Roger Ebert", "Andrea Beach", "Sheila Benson", "David Sterritt", "Peter Travers", "Duncan Wu", "David Nusair", "Kathi Maio", "Sean Axmaker", "Cathy Burke", "Dennis Schwartz", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Film4 Staff", "Tim Brayton", "Variety Staff", "Fernando F.
