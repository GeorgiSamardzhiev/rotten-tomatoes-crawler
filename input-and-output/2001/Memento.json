{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Leonard (Guy Pearce) is tracking down the man who raped and murdered his wife. The difficulty, however, of locating his wife's killer is compounded by the fact that he suffers from a rare, untreatable form of memory loss. Although he can recall details of life before his accident, Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he's going, or why.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "Christopher Nolan", "studio": "TeamTodd,IRememberProductions,Llc,NewmarketCapitalGroup", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 1, 2017", "box_office": "$25.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A nifty puzzle worth assembling. The film that put Nolan on the map. A psychological film noir breakthrough. [Full review in Spanish]", "Although the plot itself isn't terribly complex, the editing is so labyrinthine that multiple viewings are almost certainly necessary.", "The brain-teasing mystery put Christopher Nolan on the map as a filmmaking force...", "Pearce is positively astounding.", "Nolan's winding timelines and practical stunts are marvels to behold, but they seldom compare to the slow push-in on Leonard's face, as brief but powerful bursts of memory envelop the screen.", "Think of all the ways that a linear film structure stabilizes us - the cause and effect chain of events. But Memento is about a character completely destabilized, so Nolan destabilizes us accordingly in a way maybe no other movie has.", "Memento takes us on a mental trip of recovery, revenge, and remembering.", "Memento would only be half as fun with only one gimmick or the other. Instead, the backward storytelling and the frozen man make for a wonderful pair, combining into something far more redemptive than it sounds.", "Memento isn't just a film with a twist ending; its scatterbrained storytelling literally keeps you guessing with every scene.", "Christopher Nolan's cinematic breakthrough...", "If the prospect of having to do some of the work yourself doesn't alarm you, then Nolan's first American film is well worth catching, a thriller which is for once authentically Borgesian, to use an overworked qualifier.", "I can't remember when a movie has seemed so clever, strangely affecting and slyly funny at the very same time.", "Writer-director Christopher Nolan's second film is one of the most original and ultimately confounding mind games to reach the screen since The Usual Suspects.", "The young British writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has every intention of putting us through the mill, doubles his fun by running the whole story backward.", "The astonishing payoff takes the film to another level entirely, unleashing a battery of existential questions that shed new light on everything that precedes it.", "The three leads are excellent, but it's the masterful execution of an almost-too-clever-for-its-own-good concept which really makes this the most delicious kind of food for the mind.", "Pearce's central performance is as compelling as the film's premise and Nolan's execution of it. In Pearce's hands, Leonard is a time bomb with a short fuse.", "You have to pay close attention to Memento, the most original thriller to come along in years -- and one of the best.", "This terrific movie, about one man's quest for vengeance, does everything a thriller is supposed to do: intrigue, involve and keep you guessing.", "If nothing else, Memento is a savvy comment on the queasy uncertainties of the postmodern condition, in which history goes no further back than yesterday's news."], "rating": ["4/5", "1", "3/4", "3.5/4", "", "5/5", "", "", "", "4/4", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Fico Cangiano", "Mike Massie", "Tom Meek", "Richard Propes", "Siddhant Adlakha", "Adam Kempenaar", "Ed Travis", "Joshua Rothkopf", "C.J.
