{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The beautiful Vicky (Shu Qi) drifts through her empty life in the sprawling metropolis of Taipei, Taiwan, maintaining a pointless relationship with her loser DJ boyfriend, Hao-Hao (Tuan Chun-hao), and an unsatisfying career as a nightclub hostess. As her romance becomes increasingly strained, she decides to take up with Jack (Jack Kao), a caring but criminally connected businessman. But this new relationship can't change Vicky's aimless nature, and her future remains as doubtful as ever.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "2h", "director": "Hsiao-hsien Hou", "studio": "3HFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 28, 2017", "box_office": "$14.8K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Millennium Mambo blunts the many rhythms of urban life into an empty time less lived than passively endured.", "Visually striking movie.", "We get far too few opportunities in the U.S. to see Hou's gorgeous films on the big screen.
