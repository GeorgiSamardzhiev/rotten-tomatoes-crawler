{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Slipping into a coma following a freakish accident, cartoonist Stu Miley (Brendan Fraser) finds himself in an incredible fantasy world known as Down Town. To return to reality, Stu has to outwit Death, herself (Whoopi Goldberg)... but one of the cartoonist's own creations, Monkeybone, has come to life and is manically intent on destroying Stu's plans to resume his life.", "rating": "19", "genre": "Animation/Comedy/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Henry Selick", "studio": "1492Pictures,TwitchingImageStudio,TwentiethCenturyFox", "theater_date": "Feb 23, 2001", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$5.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Monkeybone doesn't make a lot of sense, and, worse, makes little creative use of the contrast between animation and action.", "It is a puzzling melange of live action and cartoon, real life and fantasy that is almost stupefyingly incoherent.", "Starts out bad and gets progressively worse.", "Fun fun fun, but not necessarily for all the family.", "Primed to be dark, twisted, and playful -- all exhibited traits of the works of the director, animator Henry Selick -- it is instead juvenile, amateurish, and sloppy.", "A bundle of chaotic energy signifying nothing.", "The film Monkeybone is a raucous mess. Director Henry Selick mixes animation and live action to the noisy, clumsy detriment of both.", "...an outrageously funny demonstration of how our interior angst can be put into the service of art.", "This tale about alter ego and greed generates more morbid and sexual content than a real sense of ghoulish fun or panic.", "A crass and frantic comedy-fantasy pitched alternately, I think, at ten-year-olds or stoned college students.", "You can almost see money dripping off the walls of the sets and cybersets in this special-effects extravaganza.", "The design is often brilliant, although the film is nowhere near as tasteless or funny as it ought to be.", "The movie doesn't seem to have a purpose other than to fill space.", "Click to read the article.", "An embarrassment for Brendan Fraser. Consider this surreal comedy attempt a career hurdle that Fraser has since cleared.", "Don't waste your time with this monkey business.", "Monkeybone is kind of like a Tim Burton movie - except it wasn't directed by Tim Burton.", "There's a special place in my heart for movies that create new worlds for us to inhabit.", "A largely frustrating 90-minute experience.", "Selick does his cast a major disservice."], "rating": ["", "", "1/5", "", "3/10", "2/4", "1.5/5", "3.5/4", "2/5", "0/5", "", "", "2/4", "", "F", "", "2.5/4", "B", "2/5", "1.5/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Kathi Maio", "Bob Thomas", "Scott G.
