{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Leelee Sobieski is brash, abrasive and vulnerable as a teenage child of divorce who hides her pain behind a mask of hard-edged gothic rebellion. Albert Brooks plays a man who is her total opposite, a precise and well-ordered menswear store owner of forty-nine who manages limited expectations and protects lonely secrets with pleasant ritual and quiet, ironic reserve. These two total opposites collide in conflict then come together in a surprising alliance, changing each other's lives forever.", "rating": "52", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Christine Lahti", "studio": "FilmRoman,Inc.,TotalFilmGroup,ApolloMedia,FirelightFilms", "theater_date": "Oct 19, 2001", "dvd_date": "Feb 19, 2016", "box_office": "$621.4K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Offbeat friendship is provocative, dark, but sweet.", "Terrible script, terrible plot, clichs and plot holes galore...", "The actors earn the couple of salty drops you may shed at the end -- the script sure doesn't.", "Actress Lahti's feature directorial debut is a disappointingly sappy melodrama about the unlikely bond between a rebebllious high-school grad (Leelee Sobieski) and a dying older man (Albert Brooks).", "", "A beautiful story about finding camaraderie, and ultimate love in the infrequent of places", "...while Ghost World is, on the whole, a slightly better movie, My First Mister is nevertheless worth checking out mostly due to two incredible lead performances.", "", "Starts out as a deliriously original \"odd couple\" comedy, and then hangs a quick left turn into shameless tear jerking.", "A good small movie featuring a different kind of love story..", "A corny manipulative mess with a decent cast, and nothing more.
