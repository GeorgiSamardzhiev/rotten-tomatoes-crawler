However, this one certainly holds interest, for its extreme weirdness and its unusual photography.", "Nosferatu remains the best vampire movie of all time. It possesses a strain of sheer dread not captured by any subsequent bloodsucker film.", "F.W Murnau's 1922 Gothic masterpiece in many ways, paved the way for genre horror films and completely encapsulated audiences at the time of its release.", "It's remarkable, by contrast with all the films that have appropriated the stair shot, that Murnau's Nosferatu avoids any such shortcuts: turning leafy landscapes into places of horror, playing violence as romance, and romance as violence.", "Completely lacking in gratuity and malice: it creates all of its dramatic effect from the simple interplay between light and dark, and the suggestion of Nosferatu's diabolism.", "One of the best and most beautiful horror classics.", "Nosferatu is the seminal moment for horror cinema.", "So this is it: ground zero, the birth of horror cinema.", "Nosferatu remains the best vampire movie of all time. It possesses a strain of sheer dread not captured by any subsequent bloodsucker film.", "Whatever your opinion regarding intellectual property, I'm sure you'll agree we're fortunate that the movie survived, even in its various contested and truncated forms.", "The movie's best effect is its star...He looks every bit like an actual demonic wild-thing, retrieved from deep within the German wilderness and trotted out to perform for Murnau's camera.", "Still one of the scariest, most unnerving films ever made.", "There is pure expressionist inspiration in Murnau's juxtaposition of the malign wolves and the terrified old women: a poetry of fear.", "It is the sort of thing one could watch at midnight without its having much effect upon one's slumbering hours.", "Never mind that much of the story of this first important screen version of the Dracula legend seems corny and dated, for what counts is its atmosphere and its images, which are timeless in their power.", "Less frightening than haunting, Murnau's film conjures a persistent atmosphere of dread and decay, thanks in part to Max Schreck's immortal performance as Orlok.", "It's not just a great horror movie. It's a poem of horror, a symphony of dread, a film so rapt, mysterious and weirdly lovely it haunts the mind long after it's over.", "Count Orlock, played by the hideous Max Schreck, creeps through Murnau's archetypal silent imagery with a mesmerising authority that retains a surprising amount of tension.", "The metaphysical style is most vividly rendered by Murnau's obsessive use of point-of-view shots, which force a viewer to follow the characters into the abyss of their terrifying visions.", "'Nosferatu' is worthwhile on two counts: mise-en-scne and the actor who is the title (and sole) vampire."], "rating": ["2/4", "4/4", "", "", "5/5", "", "4/5", "", "4/4", "9/10", "4/5", "5/5", "5/5", "", "", "", "4/4", "5/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Kate Cameron", "Matt Brunson", "Holly Edwards", "Pamela Hutchinson", "PJ Nabarro", "Leslie Combemale", "Andrew Lowry", "Tom Huddleston", "Matt Brunson", "Christopher Long", "Noel Murray", "Rich Cline", "Peter Bradshaw", "Mordaunt Hall", "Kevin Thomas", "Dennis Lim", "Michael Wilmington", "Alan Jones", "Richard Brody", "Donald J.
