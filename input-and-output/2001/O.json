{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Moving the classic tale of \"Othello\" onto the basketball courts of a high school, the story focuses on a young black man named Odin (Mekhi Phifer) who is convinced by a conniving best friend, Hugo (Josh Hartnett) that his girlfriend (Julia Stiles) is cheating on him. Of course, what Odin doesn't know is that Hugo is in fact motivated by his own jealousy of Odin's good fortune. It's a sticky situation in classic Shakespearean tradition.", "rating": "64", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Tim Blake Nelson", "studio": "ChickietheCop,RhulenEntertainment,DanielFriedEntertainment", "theater_date": "Aug 31, 2001", "dvd_date": "May 14, 2016", "box_office": "$16.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The presence of old lags Martin Sheen and John Heard just beggars belief.
