{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Dapper Danny Ocean (George Clooney) is a man of action. Less than 24 hours into his parole from a New Jersey penitentiary, the wry, charismatic thief is already rolling out his next plan. Following three rules: Don't hurt anybody, don't steal from anyone who doesn't deserve it, and play the game like you've got nothing to lose. Danny orchestrates the most sophisticated, elaborate casino heist in history.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "Steven Soderbergh", "studio": "VillageRoadshowProd.,JerryWeintraubProductions", "theater_date": "Dec 7, 2001", "dvd_date": "Jun 28, 2011", "box_office": "$183.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A big-budget, stylish heist film with an A-list cast, well-suited to match.", "Quite possibly one of the best remakes ever made", "Although Soderbergh makes the audience privy to most of the Ocean crew's scheming, he keeps some details back so that the ultimate execution of the sting is a surprise for us.", "As we live and breathe, Steven Soderbergh is making the best kid-stuff for adults since Howard Hawks put Cary Grant in a sombrero. It's no small achievement.", "Combining enough star wattage to rival the lights of Vegas, the writing talents of Ted Griffin and Soderbergh's incredible directorial and cinematographic gifts, you've got yourself a winner that will stand the test of time.", "Soderbergh absolutely nailed the formula for a modern heist movie, in a fashion so satisfying that nothing (including the film's sequels) has been able to match it since.", "Somehow this has emerged as one of the more entertaining films I've seen in months.", "As tight and bright a jolt of jumped-up joshing-around as you'll ever encounter.", "Extremely slick yet consistently entertaining...", "One of the greatest dessert courses in contemporary cinema.", "Soderbergh's most commercial film to date is a star-driven, semi-successful, slightly better remake of the 1960 origianl feature.", "Fun heist movie for older kids and their families.", "A perfect example of smart, fun mainstream entertainment. David Holmes' mod-jazz score pulses with pep, and even with the star power, Steven Soderbergh makes room for winning supporting turns from Eddie Jemison, Shaobo Qin and Carl Reiner.", "An entertaining witty, funny, and well acted piece of comedy heist.", "A lark for everybody concerned, including the audience.", "Whatever you do, don't pay attention.", "", "Soderbergh and Griffin concoct a doozy of a robbery, seemingly impossible with a new hitch around every corner. The cast, headed by Clooney, never loses its cool and never gives away a surprise beforehand.", "This wholly enjoyable entertainment sees Soderbergh setting himself a new challenge - the hi-tech robbery procedural - and relishing the clichs even as he freshens them with a dab of polish, wit, pace and a light touch of irony.", "A fast paced, enjoyable flick, stylishly filmed, filled with great, or at least well-known actors, that doesn't disappoint, but doesn't make a lasting impression either."], "rating": ["7/10", "", "4/5", "", "", "8/10", "3/5", "4/5", "3/4", "1", "B", "4/5", "4/4", "", "", "2/4", "4.5/5", "3/4", "", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Rachel Wagner", "PJ Nabarro", "Joshua Rothkopf", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Sean Collier", "Louisa Moore", "Leigh Paatsch", "David Nusair", "Tim Brayton", "Emanuel Levy", "Nell Minow", "Nick Rogers", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Todd McCarthy", "Joe Lozito", "", "Jeffrey M.
