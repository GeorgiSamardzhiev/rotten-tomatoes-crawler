But the closer Luis becomes to Julia, the more enigmatic she seems to be. For Luis, the loneliness which led to love becomes a passion which transcends reason and defies convention, as he and Julia engage in a dangerous dance that takes them across the landscape of Cuba, into obsession, eroticism... and perhaps even murder.", "rating": "12", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 52m", "director": "Michael Cristofer", "studio": "ViaRosaProductions,IntermediaFilms,MetroGoldwynMayer,HydeParkEntertainment,DiNoviPictures,EpsilonMotionPictures", "theater_date": "Aug 3, 2001", "dvd_date": "Oct 7, 2016", "box_office": "$16.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Though written and directed by a Pulitzer Prize winner, Original Sin is better known as the picture in which a naked Angelina Jolie (by then a certified Oscar winner) and Antonio Banderas do the horizontal mambo.
