{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Combining outrageous, sexy comedy with the hottest snowboarding action around, snowboarding buddies Rick (Jason London), Luke (Zach Galifianakis), Anthony (Flex Alexander) and Pigpen live to board on Alaska's Bull Mountain.

You can't go into this movie expecting anything innovative.", "Its only redeeming value is the killer snowboarding scenes.", "Out Cold is essentially a spineless, unfunny Animal House. The pretence of plot is distracting and insulting.", "Funnier than Woody Allen's last four movies, more exciting than Tarkovski's The Sacrifice, Out Cold will play best if your first legal beer is still far enough into the future to seem a vision of the promised land.", "Just don't waste your time or money.", "There's really nothing to recommend about Out Cold.", "The result is so derivative, they should've called it Eskimo Pie.", "", "Basically a low-rent remake of the 1984 low-rent teenage sex comedy Hot Dog ... The Movie.", "I would mention that Out Cold boasts some pretty impressive snowboarding sequences, but so do most TV commercials.", "How appropriate this overcooked turkey opened over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend! And I'm here to give it a basting.", "What can you say about a movie that includes its outtake bloopers reel before the closing credits?", "If you've made a movie in which former TV star Lee Majors ... is the funniest person present, then you have surely made a movie that sucks a lot.", "Even though no one in the film breaks a leg, Out Cold is as lame as it gets.", "The best that can be said of Out Cold is that it is generally more lame than obnoxious.", "Funnier than it has any right to be and it's generally enjoyable."], "rating": ["2/4", "", "2.5/5", "0.5/5", "", "", "0.5/4", "2.5/4", "0/4", "", "D", "3/10", "", "3/10", "0/4", "0/5", "D+", "", "1/4", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Susan Stark", "Lisa Alspector", "John R.
