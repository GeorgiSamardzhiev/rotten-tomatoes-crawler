{"metadata": {"synopsis": "\"Princesa\" is the story of Fernanda, a 19-year-old Brazilian transsexual whose dream is to become a woman, find a husband and lead the life of a \"normal\" housewife.

On the streets she is transformed into Princesa - a stylish and alluring figure who makes a lot of money and many friends among the prostitutes and clients.", "rating": "71", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 34m", "director": "Henrique Goldman", "studio": "", "theater_date": "Dec 7, 2001", "dvd_date": "Apr 12, 2017", "box_office": "$19.7K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "", "", "With its warm humour and gritty realism, it's like a combination of the two extremes in the prostitute genre: Nights of Cabiria meets Pretty Woman!", "Whatever [Fernanda] was like, this movie is a fantastic tribute to her.", "Fernanda's trials and lessons are ticked off with a brisk, businesslike air that leaves little time for emotional and character development.", "[L]ed by the wooden, unattractive Ingrid de Souza as Fernanda, the film has no place to go but down.", "It's all quite the soap opera, made all the more melodramatic because it's a quasi-true story.", "Squanders a colorful setting and characters with uninspired acting and direction.", "Fernanda's life unfolds with discretion, compassion and humor under the sensitive yet lively direction of Goldman.", "Never really convinces.", "Princesa, like its heroine, is not at all what it seems at first. For its immediately straightforward melodramatics leave in the film's wake a haunting afterglow of a life not easily resolved by a screenplay's third act.", "The film suffers from a 'based-on-a- true-story' tag, and it not only polishes up the truth but also crushes everything down to soap-opera melodrama.", "A sympathetic look at what it's like to be a Brazilian transsexual prostitute working in Milan.", "Up until its oddly flat ending, Princesa is an honest depiction of the way dreams can backfire.", "[Goldman] tells Princesa's story with admirable simplicity, carefully skirting away from any easy sentimentality or victimization.", "Manages to tell its story (based on a real character) with great sensitivity.", "Deliberately non-gritty but still humane and loving in its depiction of people who don't fit into traditional categories of male/female and whore/john.", "Like Mr. Almodvar in his recent movies, this director goes beyond camp, which can be defined as the travesty of earnest sentiment into a realm of clear and honest emotion.", "An honest, heartfelt melodrama."], "rating": ["4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3.5/5", "4/5", "", "1/4", "3/5", "", "3.5/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "3.5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["", "Emanuel Levy", "Jamie Russell", "Rich Cline", "Ron Wells", "Hazel-Dawn Dumpert", "Marta Barber", "Tim Cogshell", "Frank Scheck", "Kevin Thomas", "Bob Strauss", "David Ehrenstein", "Jeffrey M.
