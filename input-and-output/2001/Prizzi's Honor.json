{"metadata": {"synopsis": "For Charley Partanna (Jack Nicholson), life in the Prizzi family is good as long as he honors the wishes of the Godfather (William Hickey). Partanna is respected for ruthlessly carrying out murder contracts, but his wise-talking Brooklyn existence is turned on its head when he falls for a beautiful hit woman (Kathleen Turner) from the West Coast. He follows her back to California, balancing work commitments and his love interest until a new contract makes things difficult.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 9m", "director": "John Huston", "studio": "AmericanBroadcastingCompany(ABC)", "theater_date": "Jun 14, 1985", "dvd_date": "Sep 16, 2003", "box_office": "$26.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["John Huston's best film in years.", "A dark comedy, to be sure, but it all ends on a surprisingly dour note that it never quite earns.", "I think it's just about a great movie, and certainly one of director John Huston's best.", "Almost every possible mob film has been made, but this one still feels inventive and engaging.", "John Huston's dark, cynical comedy about the Mafia, one of his last pictures, suffers from the lack of chemistry between Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner, but Anjelica Huston is excellent in a well-deserving Oscar-winning turn.", "A blackly comic and insidiously sly love story in the unforgiving underworld of mob families and freelance criminals...", "", "", "Huston steers clear of slapstick clich and keeps the comedy coming, right to its violently funny ending.", "John Huston's Prizzi's Honor packs love, sex, and murder -- and dark comedy -- into a labyrinthine tale.", "As usual, Turner works hard and manages to lend some conviction to a shoddily written part, but she can't connect with Nicholson, whose obscure hamminess leaves him isolated on some other planet.", "Widely considered a black comedy classic, Prizzi's Honor is dated today and, tragically, finally revealed as a middling work that wanders aimlessly and ends abruptly.", "A very stylish walk with love and death.", "", "", "", "", "Yes, it went a little too long, felt a little forced at times, began with one of the most unnecessary lengthy wedding scenes of all-time and ended on a note that simply didn't satisfy, but overall, I enjoyed it and would recommend it.", "This is the most bizarre comedy in many a month, a movie so dark, so cynical and so funny that perhaps only Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner could have kept straight faces during the love scenes.", "A black comedy about an ill-fated love affair and the nasty politics of a criminal clan."], "rating": ["", "2.5/4", "4/4", "3.5/4", "B", "", "3/5", "4/5", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "5/5", "3/5", "4/5", "4/5", "7/10", "3.5/4", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Molly Haskell", "Matthew Lucas", "Jeffrey M.
