{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A comedy set in the world of '80s rock 'n' roll, \"Rock Star\" is the story of an office supplies salesman who moonlights as a musician in a tribute band and whose life is changed forever when he is chosen out of the blue to replace the lead singer of his all-time favorite band, Steel Dragon.", "rating": "53", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Stephen Herek", "studio": "MaysvillePictures,WarnerBrothers,RobertLawrenceProductions,BelAirEntertainment,MetalProductions,Inc.", "theater_date": "Sep 7, 2001", "dvd_date": "May 4, 2010", "box_office": "$17.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Capping off a not-to-be-missed soundtrack, real-life heavy metal musicians... add credibility to the film as they take to the stage as members of the Steel Dragon band.", "Not great, but moments of guilty pleasure.", "A watered down, lukewarm and very clich rock fantasy...", "The first half is hilarious but the second gives itself more to cautionary moralising and life lessons.", "Every character becomes a cipher for a strangely reactionary morality tale.", "", "Just as it should be falling apart, its melodrama becomes more touching than ever, ultimately shaping a film about much more than any band and more poetic than any song on the radio.", "The milieu is more convincing than the story.", "Mark Wahlberg looks yummy in tight leather pants and that's a good thing because there's not much else to recommend . . . ROCK STAR.", "Okay, so the plot's as fantastical and absurd as that whole, awful era, but damned if it isn't a good time.", "Forget the storyline, just laugh (and cringe) at the period.", "A veteran of arena stage concerts, Wahlberg's obviously got the moves and the attitude, but in offstage moments where more complex characterization is needed, he flounders.", "Despite its flaws, screenwriters Callie Khouri and John Stockwell still manage to save Rock Star by writing a semi-entertaining script.", "It is a nonstop cliche.", "Very watchable, owing to a pair of strong performances from its two leads, but it isn't the great film it could have been.", "It offers witty entertainment and an easy, tourist-level jaunt through the more absurd precincts of big-time rock 'n' roll.", "This is not Spinal Tap, but it is a fun though far from decadent or persuasive rock epic about finding your own voice in life.", "Surprisingly, Wahlberg's 'Rock Star' mesmerized me right along with all those screaming fans and sexy groupies depicted in the film.", "This is the first R-rated movie that feels PG-13, a heavy-metal saga you can take Mom to see.", "While not in the same league as either This Is Spinal Tap or Almost Famous, this rock-band movie is at least thoroughly entertaining."], "rating": ["", "3/5", "", "4/5", "", "2.5/5", "3.5/4", "2/4", "2/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3.5/5", "2.5/5", "2/4", "3/5", "3/4", "3/5", "", "", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Debbie Lynn Elias", "Nell Minow", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Angie Errigo", "Geoff Andrew", "", "Steven Snyder", "Jeffrey Westhoff", "Andrea Chase", "Kimberley Jones", "Tom Grealis", "John R.
