{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Rudy Ruettiger (Sean Astin) wants to play football at the University of Notre Dame, but has neither the money for tuition nor the grades to qualify for a scholarship. Rudy redoubles his efforts to get out of the steel mill where his father works when his best friend (Christopher Reed) dies in an accident there. Overcoming his dyslexia thanks to his friend and tutor, D-Bob (Jon Favreau), Rudy gains admission to Notre Dame and begins to fight his way onto the school's fabled football team.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Drama/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "David Anspaugh", "studio": "TriStarPictures", "theater_date": "Sep 18, 1993", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$20.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's definitely a really wonderful movie if you want to be inspired by a goal that you have in your life and you want to be motivated.", "So sentimental it moves you to laughter rather than tears.", "Corny and manipulative as it is, Rudy is a movie that makes you want to cheer -- if not for the real-life Rudy Ruettiger's public relations triumph, at least for the mythical Rudy's brave pursuit of an All-American dream.", "Anspaugh, whose Hoosiers showed he knows from feel-good movies, directs this story as if he were conducting Bolero, carefully building climax upon climax as the story spirals to an underdog triumph every bit as tearful as that of Rocky.", "At times it is both overly sentimental and unintentionally funny.", "The film is so effective because Rudy is never seen as mock-heroic, and he's never lifted toward unrealistic achievement. He simply does the very best he can.", "Underneath its rah-rah spirit, the PG-rated Rudy is straightforward enough to raise, albeit unintentionally, some troubling questions.", "Ideally, this movie should be seen as a double feature with Knute Rockne, All-American, that other great movie about Notre Dame football.", "Well acted but overly familiar and sentimental sports tale of the underdog", "continues to make life seem a little better", "Inspiring sports film about a real life underdog.", "Rudy is one of those beating-the-odds tales that no one does better than Hollywood. A film that hits all the right emotional buttons, it's an intelligent, sentimental drama that lifts an audience to its feet cheering.", "With its faithful rendering of a true inspirational story, Rudy earns its sentiment...an irresistable inspirational movie for all ages. [Blu-ray]", "Sean Astin is utterly winning...", "", "An inconsequential, if moving, contribution to the sports-movie genre.", "[A] well-crafted piece of middle-American uplift.", "Directed with composure, but no great fervour, the film's conspicuously uninterested in American football, and much concerned with testing the limits and the resilience of the American dream.", "", "Shamelessly manipulative, but who cares when it's so damn uplifting?"], "rating": ["", "", "3/4", "3/4", "2/5", "3.5/4", "", "B+", "C+", "B", "5/5", "", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "2.5/5", "", "", "3/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Rachel Wagner", "Quentin Curtis", "Dennis King", "Johanna Steinmetz", "John Ferguson", "Jeff Shannon", "Kenneth Turan", "Nell Minow", "Emanuel Levy", "John A.
