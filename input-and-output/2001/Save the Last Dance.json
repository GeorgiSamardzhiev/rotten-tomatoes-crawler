{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Sara (Julia Stiles) is moved from a small Midwestern town to the south side of Chicago when her mother dies in a car accident, and must live with her father. She soon falls for an African American teenager (Sean Patrick Thomas) at her new high school and he has less than an idyllic past. They share a love for dance (ballet and hip hop respectively) and together they tackle the problems that go with an interracial relationship.", "rating": "53", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Thomas Carter", "studio": "MTVFilms,ParamountPicturesInternational,Cort/MaddenProductions", "theater_date": "Jan 12, 2001", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$91.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A hip, hopeful MTV romance.", "A solid dance-themed movie, with acting of a slightly higher calibre than the genre usually demands.", "This movie has sentimental value.

And the dancing is fun to watch, too.", "Likeable teen romance that overcomes its inevitable predictability thanks to its talented cast and its avoidance of both clichs and syrupy sentimentality.", "Carter has given us a pleasant enough, if not especially original film.", "There are enough respectable social messages here.", "If \"Dance\" stumbles into a few too many subplots and a couple of cliched characters along the way, it also makes some strong points about contemporary attitudes toward the idea of interracial romances.", "A refreshingly friendly view of a romance between people of different pigmentation, an area where more respectable pictures still wimp out.", "Told with a refreshing lack of sensationalism.", "The leads shine and the relationship really grew on me.
