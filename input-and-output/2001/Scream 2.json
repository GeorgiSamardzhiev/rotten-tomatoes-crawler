{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Sydney (Neve Campbell) and tabloid reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) survived the events of the first \"Scream,\" but their nightmare isn't over. When two college students are murdered at a sneak preview of \"Stab,\" a movie based on the events from the first film, it's clear a copycat killer is on the loose. Sydney and Gail, as well as fellow survivors Deputy Dewey (David Arquette) and Randy (Jamie Kennedy) have to find out who is behind this new murder spree, before they all end up dead.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Comedy/Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h", "director": "Wes Craven", "studio": "Craven-MaddalenaFilms,MiramaxFilms,KonradPictures,DimensionFilms,MavenEntertainmentInc.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 21, 2016", "box_office": "$101.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A perfect horror sequel.", "At least the movie-within-a-movie angle and the creative liberties taken with details in Gale's book are somewhat clever.", "A solid sequel that does a great job at making fun of itself. [Full review in Spanish].", "Running the gamut from horror parody to the inclusion of high art and stage tragedy, Scream 2 like a great piece of literary fiction.", "A sharp collection of observations strung across two hours of bloodshed, intricate motives, pointed cultural references and nearly flawless examples of well-modulated tension.", "Old-hand Craven delivers a delectably gruesome, well-crafted horror yarn that is crisply edited, inventively photographed and devilishly cast.", "Its self-awareness has a brashness that can be enlivening.", "The first 10 minutes attain a deranged brilliance (especially considering Charlie Kaufman wouldn't introduce his own brand of narrative invention for another two years).", "...a perfunctory (yet consistently watchable) sequel...", "Bloody good fun.", "The rest of the cast of disposable archetypes deadpanned about why ''sequels suck'' -- a particularly funny joke, since this one didn't.", "A bland limp sequel that fails to follow the act of the charismatic first film...", "Slightly milder sequel to the post-modern slasher.", "There's a lot more going on here than in Scream... So why isn't it a slam dunk? Because of the writing, which is just lousy in any number of ways.", "The weakest entry in the trilogy, but it's still smarter than the majority of horror films that get released each year.", "Visceral, witty and appropriately redundant...", "Clever parody of the sequel trend; once again we are treated to a movie mocking its own conventions. Some great comic -- and terrifying -- moments, but suffers for not being as original as the original.", "If you liked Scream there's no reason you shouldn't like this sequel.", "This disappointing sequel to last year's horror sleeper gets trapped in the clichs it's trying to send up.", "Scream 2 is as clever and nerve-wracking as the original; on its own self-referential, crowd-pleasing terms, it's a success."], "rating": ["5/5", "4/10", "3/4", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "B", "3.5", "2.5/4", "3.5/4", "B", "", "3/5", "5/10", "3/4", "", "3/4", "", "2/4", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Trace Thurman", "Mike Massie", "Federico Furzan", "C.H.
