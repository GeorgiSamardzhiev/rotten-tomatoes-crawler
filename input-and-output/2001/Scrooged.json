{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this modern take on Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol,\" Frank Cross (Bill Murray) is a wildly successful television executive whose cold ambition and curmudgeonly nature has driven away the love of his life, Claire Phillips (Karen Allen). But after firing a staff member, Eliot Loudermilk (Bobcat Goldthwait), on Christmas Eve, Frank is visited by a series of ghosts who give him a chance to re-evaluate his actions and right the wrongs of his past.", "rating": "71", "genre": "Comedy/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Richard Donner", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 6, 2014", "box_office": "$58.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Scrooged is one of the few times in the history of cinema we see faeries as the complicated, cruel, monstrous, (and sometimes funny) creatures they are - David Bowie's The Labyrinth being another rare example.", "It's not a bad notion for a satiric comedy and this one begins well, but then veers entirely out of hand until it's as over-inflated as its own Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come and as funny as a mugging.", "On balance... Bill Murray's lazy humor carries the movie up until his genuinely sweet relationship with an old girlfriend.", "It's a missed opportunity, but some gags still hit the mark and there's a stream of starry cameos...", "Scrooged is, indeed, phenomenally loud, and also very mean, and somehow also ultimately heartening, in a loopy yuletide sort of way.", "Still, Murray is magnificent in the film, the effects are better than you'd expect, and the 1988 version of Hollywood excess is almost quaint by comparison with the CGI purgatory we live in today.", "It would be hard to improve upon the classic, after all, and Scrooged not only sticks to the Dickens plot, but makes it believable as a modern fable. But the more difficult part of Scrooged is its modernization, the colorization of Dickens, if you will.", "Murray, it's clear today, was the perfect Scrooge of the '80s.", "Despite the juicy, on-the-edge craziness, Murray is able to layer his outrageous histrionics with an inner sensibility, making his ultimate transformation not only believable but Christmas-cheer uplifting.", "Murray doing what he does best, if you like that sort of thing.", "It's got Bill Murray, and that's always a good thing.", "A meaningful Christmas Carol this is not, but a perfectly entertaining yuletide comedy this certainly is.", "Bill Murray is the one of the greatest screen Scrooges in this 1980s updating.", "Tacky in the extreme, this self-congratulatory 1988 film is an exercise in hypocrisy, indulging every form of Christmas exploitation that it pretends to attack, and many of the laughs are forced.", "A number of talented actors appear, but only a few are able to make much of a mark given their limited screentime.", "An appallingly unfunny comedy, and a vivid illustration of the fact that money can't buy you laughs.", "Frequently funny take on Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\" with Murray learning a lesson.", "Rowdy stuff for the light in head.", "", "I found much of this irreverent modernization of A Christmas Carol to be hilarious, and I commend Murray and director Donner for giving their film a sardonic edge."], "rating": ["5/5", "", "3/4", "3/5", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "3/5", "7/10", "7/10", "", "1/4", "1.5/4", "", "4/5", "", "3/5", "7/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Sez\u00edn Koehler", "Sheila Benson", "Gene Siskel", "John Ferguson", "Rob Harvilla", "Sean Nelson", "Cathy Burke", "Rob Gonsalves", "Duane Byrge", "William Thomas", "John J.
