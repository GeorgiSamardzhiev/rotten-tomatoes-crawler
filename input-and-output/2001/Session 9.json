Session 9 without this building is simply inconceivable.", "Session 9 is heavy on mood and light on narrative substance, but the pervasive sense of dread that it sustains trumps the slightness of plot.", "A brilliant, morbid peek in to human psychology.", "Playing to a classier tune, the film is one that is immersive even in its understatedness, weaving a tale that is all the more effective because of how believable it is.", "One of the best horror films of 2001 ...", "", "We've been given a new and very scary movie and it should be appreciated accordingly.", "", "", "Brad Anderson cria um forte clima de suspense e conduz o filme com seguran\u00e7a - at\u00e9 que, a 15 minutos do final, o roteiro entra em modo de auto-destrui\u00e7\u00e3o.", "", "Atmospheric chills and some solid performances ... keep the tension up for a while, until the nasty and disquieting finale.", "", "If ever a place needed a horror movie made about it, it is the abandoned Danvers State Mental Hospital in Massachusets ... utterly chilling, and will stick with you for days", "Tries to be a back-to-basics thriller without the special effects, buckets of blood and evil dolls that talk.
