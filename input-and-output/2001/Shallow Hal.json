{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The story revolves around Hal (Jack Black) who, taking his dying father's advice, dates only the embodiments of female physical perfection. But that all changes after Hal has an unexpected run-in with self-help guru Tony Robbins. Intrigued by Hal's shallowness, Robbins hypnotizes him into seeing the beauty that exists even in the least physically appealing women.", "rating": "49", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "Robert Farrelly, Peter Farrelly", "studio": "TwentiethCenturyFox,ConundrumEntertainment", "theater_date": "Nov 9, 2001", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$70.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The pervasive, uncomfortable feeling from Hal's confusion distracts from the commendable nature of the themes and the effectiveness of the humor.", "Obviously no one bothered to tell Bobby and Peter Farrelly to stick to what they do best in film making - insanity, stupidity and raunchy bathroom jokes.", "A movie that meanders from one sight gag to the next, many of which you've already seen in the commercials.", "Romantic comedy is pretty tame for Farrelly Bros.", "With the relatively untested Black coming on awfully strong, the lack of directorial finesse lets the enterprise down, creating some clunky scenes and dead air where laughs might have been expected.", "The Farrellys take an artistic step backward with this soft, disappointingly sentimental comedy about the true nature of beauty; they seem to have forgotten their roots in the outrageous and gross-out.", "", "The film is not as funny as their best, but fascinates in the discomforting way it foregrounds the brothers' normally buried, facile moral dialectic.", "[An] insulting new comedy from Bobby and Peter Farrelly.", "", "", "There's just about enough charm and laughs here to keep Farrelly fans happy.
