{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Once upon a time, in a far away swamp, there lived an ogre named Shrek (Mike Myers) whose precious solitude is suddenly shattered by an invasion of annoying fairy tale characters. They were all banished from their kingdom by the evil Lord Farquaad (John Lithgow). Determined to save their home -- not to mention his -- Shrek cuts a deal with Farquaad and sets out to rescue Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz) to be Farquaad's bride. Rescuing the Princess may be small compared to her deep, dark secret.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Animation/Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 29m", "director": "Andrew Adamson, Vicky Jenson", "studio": "DreamWorksSKG,PacificDataImages(PDI)", "theater_date": "May 18, 2001", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$267.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The most effective moments arrive in the form of clever visual gags related to well-known fairy tales.", "Shrek is unashamed of its modern flourishes. At the same time, especially for young viewers, it works very well as a straightforward and quite funny fable. The animation, coordinated by directors Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson, is impressive.", "With the perfect blend of storytelling, animation, and music this is one movie (Shrek) the whole family can enjoy!", "Unfortunately when you take out the humor there isn't that much going for it.", "The first Oscar for Best Animated Feature went to Shrek, an absurd choice to those of us who believe that Pixar's Monsters, Inc. was that year's best toon flick. Still, this is nevertheless a snappy comedy that manages to stick it to the entire genre.", "Murphy steals every scene he's in with equal parts bounce and warmth.", "Here is a movie of the times, funny, enjoyable, perfect-looking, and altogether original in a way that might cause us to look again at the meaning of the word.", "Adults will find plenty to laugh at. Children will love it.", "Shrek is alive, and with dark, sly and absolutely hilarious irreverence lampooning every once-sacred characteristic of the nursery kingdom. Shrek is a subversive joy..", "With improbable finesse it buffs up some of the oldest tropes of storytelling and then gives them a mischievous tilt, so that we appear to be watching a celebration of a genre and a sneaky subversion of it at the same time.", "Even more amazing, for a movie with its share of flatulence gags, it also has a real heart. Few films have had their cake and eaten it so gleefully.", "The best jokes in Shrek spoof Disney tradition; the villain's lair looks suspiciously like a certain theme park's Main Street USA, and a bluebird of happiness explodes during a sugary crescendo.", "Shrek qualifies as a classic animated movie, and one of the more charming films to grace screens in a long time.", "The story's simple, the quest not that complicated. But the joy of Shrek is in the telling, in the details along the way.", "The sarcastic, nasty tone of smug hipness clashes mightily with the film's shrill attempts at sincerity and lesson-learning.", "A a computer-animated burlesque fairy tale that generates more belly laughs than any live-action comedy since Best in Show.", "The animation, with its dimensional verisimilitude, is beguiling and the whole package ends with a noncloying dash of uplift.", "What the film lacks is the faintest glimmer of charm.", "Shrek may not have the class of Buzz Lightyear, but he's a lovable great lunk, and you could do a lot worse this summer than see this.", "There's no denying that the monster-as-hero device has 90-odd-minutes worth of entertainment mileage, and the delivery of the story's moral is handled well enough to avoid tweeness."], "rating": ["7/10", "", "4.5/5", "C", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "B", "5/5", "3.5/4", "5/10", "3.5/4", "3.5/5", "", "", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Kathi Maio", "Allison Rose", "Rachel Wagner", "Matt Brunson", "Paul Malcolm", "Andrew O&#39;Hagan", "Christopher Tookey", "Alexander Walker", "Anthony Quinn", "Mark Steyn", "Steve Persall", "Bob Grimm", "Matt Soergel", "Tim Brayton", "Michael Sragow", "Richard C.
