Elements of both are evident in this taut psychological thriller.", "Stuck is disturbing in all the right ways, turning an incredible real-life story of human callousness and suffering into a tawdry entertainment that makes guffawing, sociopathic rubbernecks of us all.", "Stuart Gordon's low-budget thriller is so compellingly perverse that it transcends its humble premise.", "With a little more ingenuity, a few more evilly funny lines and a more interestingly written role for its female lead, this could have been a minor cult classic.", "While it'll certainly make you wince, Gordon's slapsticky execution and misguided injections of humour serve only to bleed the situation of suspense. What emerges is not so much horror as a grisly farce.", "Uninspired by a true story, the first 20 minutes before the collision are entertaining but, after metal hits flesh, you can almost hear the premise creaking as it's stretched to feature length, resulting in some of the dullest moments I can remember.", "Bizarre film that remains watchable thanks to strong performances and a decent script, though the tone veers wildly from black comedy to violent thriller via thinly-disguised social commentary and the film never quite comes together as a result.", "disturbing in all the right ways, turning an incredible real-life story of human callousness and suffering into a tawdry entertainment that makes guffawing, sociopathic rubbernecks of us all.", "As the title of this splatter comedy by writer-director Stuart Gordon indicates, he's like a bug stuck to her windshield, and that's about the level of humanity and insight one can expect here.", "Gordon hits the proverbial ball not only directly out of the park, but also through the windshield of a ... well, maybe I should just start from the beginning.", "It's a grueling little noirish thriller with slasher-worthy gore.", "", ""], "rating": ["2.5/4", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "", "", "3/5", "3/6", "3.5/5", "3/5", "3/5", "2/5", "2/5", "3/5", "", "", "4/5", "", "B+", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Matthew Lucas", "Steve Newton", "Joshua Rothkopf", "Renee Schonfeld", "Fernando F.
