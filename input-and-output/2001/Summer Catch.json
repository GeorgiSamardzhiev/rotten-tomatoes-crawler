{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A coming-of-age romantic comedy set against the backdrop of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Local boy Ryan Dunne (Freddie Prinze Jr.), now a pitcher for Boston College, meets Tenley Parrish (Jessica Biel), the daughter of a wealthy couple who summer on the Cape. Ryan and Tenley fall in love, much to the chagrin of their families, while Ryan clings to one last hope of being discovered and signed to a pro baseball contract.", "rating": "8", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Michael Tollin", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,Tollin/RobbinsProductions", "theater_date": "Aug 24, 2001", "dvd_date": "Oct 1, 2010", "box_office": "$19.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's a movie that should have been called on account of boredom.", "Big chunks of plot seem to be missing, as if left on the editing-room floor so that director Mike Tollin, in his feature debut, can get to yet another inspiring speech.", "It's a baseball romance with precious little baseball and only the most insipid, by-the-numbers kind of romance.", "This is the WB version of a baseball movie. Everyone is young, toned, sexually active and agonizes over their future.", "The film is as predictable as the outcome of a New York Yankees-Tampa Bay Devil Rays game, but you can bet nobody will be standing up to do the wave.", "Not even a cast of fresh-faced acting hotshots can give flavour to this bland and undistinguished teen sporting romance.", "Despite an enjoyable turn from Brittany Murphy, the clichd plot (local poor boy pitches his way to the Major League) ensures that's the best this forgettable teen fodder can hope for.", "This story has its share of bad acting. But Summer Catch turns out to be a well-meaning, light, and fluffy comedy with plenty of good giggles.", "As the script works toward its big-game finale, it pauses now and then to rip off Bull Durham, to let Biel spout Successories-worthy words of encouragement, and to touch on subplots involving Prinze's familiar-faced teammates.", "Maybe the filmmakers figured that the audience for Summer Catch is too young to have seen Bull Durham.", "The film steps up a notch when the action is on the field. However, many directors before him have portrayed the beloved sport better.", "When it comes to funny business, Tollin's got game, and he makes the most of some talented supporting players on his bench.", "The element of Summer Catch that sours it all for good is that so many actors decided it would be a good idea to be in this film.", "[An] awful light drama.", "A baseball movie with no baseball, no movie, and absolutely no love involved.", "If this is what the boys of summer are offering, I say bring on football season -- now!", "Not that this is a particularly dispicable film, it just doesn't try to do anything new and delivers mostly wooden performances.", "Perhaps Freddie is simply a pawn in some sinister plan to destroy his career...", "Call this one foul.", "Yawn."], "rating": ["1/4", "1/4", "", "", "", "2/5", "2/5", "", "", "", "2/5", "", "F", "", "1/5", "1/4", "1.5/4", "1.5/4", "2/4", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Jami Bernard", "Matt Soergel", "Dennis King", "Leah Rozen", "Smriti Mundhra", "Sloan Freer", "", "Deborah Henderson", "Keith Phipps", "Malcolm Ritter", "Kit Bowen", "Joe Leydon", "Brian Orndorf", "Lisa Alspector", "Oz", "Emily Blunt", "Andrew Rodgers", "David Nusair", "Joe Mader", "Urban Cinefile Critics"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Florida Times-Union", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IGN Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Modamag.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Blunt Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Zap2it.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Palo Alto Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Urban Cinefile"], "date": ["August 8, 2014", "August 8, 2014", "August 8, 2014", "August 8, 2014", "August 8, 2014", "August 8, 2014", "June 14, 2013", "June 14, 2013", "June 14, 2013", "June 14, 2013", "November 20, 2008", "April 16, 2008", "March 31, 2007", "March 6, 2007", "January 11, 2006", "March 26, 2004", "February 25, 2004", "August 17, 2003", "May 14, 2003", "August 17, 2002"]}}
