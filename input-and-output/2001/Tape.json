{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A three-character ensemble piece set within the confines of a tawdry motor lodge in Lansing, Michigan. After 10 years apart, three disparate people come together to play out the unresolved drama of their final days in high school. Intrigued, we watch as layers of denial are slowly peeled away. Suspense builds as each character is provoked into revealing his or her true nature and motivation. Mesmerized, we are drawn into their lives as they choose which cards to play and which cards to hold.", "rating": "77", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 23m", "director": "Richard Linklater", "studio": "InDiGentEntertainment,TapeProductionsInc.", "theater_date": "Nov 2, 2001", "dvd_date": "Oct 6, 2016", "box_office": "$490.5K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's a wonderfully tense tale, played out with humor and sarcasm.", "The humor gives Tape a quirky edge, but the film falls flat whenever the dialogue drifts to allow for a theatrical set piece or joke rather than to further investigate the central dilemma.", "Fascinating and engrossing character study with strong performances from the cast...", "Tape is a perfect example of how digital filmmaking can deliver great cinematic values.", "Three actors yakking in a single drab interior, shot on HD video: It's unlikely this poverty-program recipe has, or ever will again, yield results quite as entertaining as \"Tape.\"", "", "This makes good on that old Dogme promise by discarding the crutches of conventional movie drama and concentrating on the raw essentials of character and story.", "Though I admired the idea behind the film, the execution, and the performances, the material doesn't seem to add up to anything.", "", "Linklater is testing the boundaries of what can be done with digital video, thematically as well as visually.", "Tape brilliantly mixes sex, lies, and videotape-esque quirks with some supreme mental fornicative twists to produce an engaging chunk of film.", "A testament to why blockbuster junkies like me should turn off the Dolby digital and turn on the IFC every now and then.", "Unlike some other filmed plays, this one contains dialogue that sounds realistic.", "The actors show great chemistry, reveling in the dialogue as they inspire each other to greater heights.", "A film, which, for all its energy, never quite sparks into life.", "As the film progresses and voices are raised the audience is dealt a very interesting and compelling film.", "Intensely claustrophobic, impeccably directed drama, featuring excellent performances by all three leads.", "The question that comes to the viewer's mind is: Who cares?", "The actors do justice to this potent and insightful script, filling the screen with explosive energy.", "It makes up for its low cost and minimal set (a single hotel room) with searing emotional intensity."], "rating": ["", "3/5", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "3/5", "3/4", "4/5", "4/5", "3/4", "A", "", "3/5", "4/5", "", "A-", "B"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["B.
