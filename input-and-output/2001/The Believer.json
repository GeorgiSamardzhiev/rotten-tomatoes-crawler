The result is arresting, prickly, vaguely funny, even - 'difficult' in the best sense.", "", "Em uma performance absolutamente brilhante, o jovem Ryan Gosling cria um personagem que, mesmo moralmente desprezvel, fascina por seu conflito interior.", "The underdevloped Believer has at its core a performance of searing and genuine intensity, yet it also regrettably handles the psychological turmoil of its antagonistic protagonist with kid gloves.", "Gosling projects a feral intelligence that is riveting...", "It's an explosive and disturbing film that forces the audience to ask difficult questions about the nature of belief.", "It made for an emotionally hair-pulling ride, without benefit of much intellectual give and take.", "An uncomfortable experience, but one as brave and challenging as you could possibly expect these days from American cinema.", "The Believer is packed to the gills with various speeches and lectures and theological bantering. Much of it ends with someone getting a baseball bat to the head.", "this polarizing film deserves a wider audience", "Artful, effective and socially redeeming stuff.", "You just get the sense that what you're seeing is a very personal struggle in what will probably be one of the most powerful films of the year."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "3/4", "3/5", "2.5/4", "A-", "", "4.5/5", "4/5", "C-", "", "", "C+", "4/5", "2.5/5", "B+", "3.5/4", "4.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["B.
