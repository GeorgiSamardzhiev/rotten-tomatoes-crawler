{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) enjoys the adrenaline of street car racing and his fans treat him like a rock star. After a blazing encounter with the ruthless Johnny Tran, Dom decides to take Brian (Paul Walker), a newcomer to street racing, under his wing. Dom's sister Mia sees something she likes in Brian, too. Trouble is, neither of them realize he's an undercover cop, and Dominic and his rival Johnny Tran are both the prime suspects in a case involving dirty money and big-rig hijacking.", "rating": "53", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Rob Cohen", "studio": "UniversalPictures,NealH.MoritzProductions,OriginalFilm", "theater_date": "Jun 22, 2001", "dvd_date": "Sep 10, 2015", "box_office": "$144.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Anything resembling dialogue or storytelling is actually just a mini-trampoline that allows TFAF to jump to higher levels of stupendous stuntery as the minutes and scenery flash by.", "Exudes testosterone, American brawn... amazing car chases and races; it's a gear head's wet dream.", "A spectacular start to one of Hollywood's most surprising and popular franchises ever.", "This is a bad, bad movie.
