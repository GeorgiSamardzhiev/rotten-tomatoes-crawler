{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Based on actual events, \"The Grey Zone\" is the staggeringly powerful story of the Auschwitz's twelfth Sonderkommando -- one of the thirteen consecutive \"Special Squads\" of Jewish prisoners placed by the Nazis in the excruciating moral dilemma of helping to exterminate fellow Jews in exchange for a few more months of life. From inside the working organs of the infamous Auschwitz death camp, this film asks to what terrible lengths we are willing to go to save our own lives.", "rating": "69", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Tim Blake Nelson", "studio": "KillerFilms,Goatsingers,MillenniumFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 8, 2016", "box_office": "$507.4K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["If they gave an Oscar for best ensemble acting, and I think they should, The Grey Zone would get my vote.", "This is a masterpiece and yet another chapter of the dark period called: \"The Holocaust.\"", "So many incredibly raw, wrenching--and, crucially, unsparingly unsentimental--scenes and moments that it's impossible to not be haunted by the film.", "It unsuccessfully tries to bridge the gap between pathos and establishing a sense of realism, coming across as forced. Overweight prisoners and Harvey Keitel's German accent distract from the mood of the film.", "Filme trgico, complexo, difcil - e que pode ser assistido em sesso dupla com O Pianista.", "They are dark, thoroughly uncompromising works of a filmmaker completely fearless to take an audience into dank recesses of the human condition.", "Roman Polanski's The Pianist may have been showered with Oscar glory ... but the best Holocaust film of 2002 was actually The Grey Zone.", "Unlike Schindler's List, ... this uses history to remind us of the tenuousness of our own morality, to remind us that ... most of us will never have to know what we might be capable of in certain circumstances.", "The effort is sincere and the results are honest, but the film is so bleak that it's hardly watchable.", "Hauntingly unforgettable.", "An intelligent and deeply felt work about impossible, irrevocable choices and the price of making them.", "It's hard to imagine anybody ever being \"in the mood\" to view a movie as harrowing and painful as The Grey Zone, but it's equally hard to imagine anybody being able to tear their eyes away from the screen once it's started.", "Brings light to a little-known facet of the Holocaust in a way that does justice to its moral ambiguities.", "If this story must be told and retold -- and indeed it must -- then The Grey Zone is to be lauded for finding a new and ingenious angle.", "If stars could be awarded on the basis of good intentions, The Grey Zone should be king of the galaxy. Unfortunately, it lands on earth with something of a thud.", "Effectively feeds our senses with the chilling sights and sounds from within the camp to create a completely numbing experience.", "Even in its darkest moments, a heartening defiance underlies gut-wrenching calamity.", "As bold and unyielding as The Grey Zone stands with its historical subtext, there are a few factors detracting from the powerful message.", "", "The Grey Zone is powerful, mesmerizing and disturbing."], "rating": ["B+", "", "3.5/4", "C", "5/5", "3/4", "3.5/4", "", "C", "", "2.5/4", "", "4/5", "A-", "2.5/5", "5/5", "B+", "3/4", "2.5/4", "4.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Joel Siegel", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Michael Dequina", "Jason Gorber", "Pablo Villa\u00e7a", "Sara Michelle Fetters", "Matt Brunson", "M.
