{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A New Jersey man named Jimmy (Frank Whaley) splits his time between working as a lowly supermarket stock boy and inventing things. Unfortunately, the latter part of his career has not been going well, and his wife, Annie (Carla Gugino), has just had their first baby. Meanwhile, his best friend, Ray (Ethan Hawke), is a slacker who seems to be a terrible influence. Amid all this angst, Jimmy decides to participate in a nearby comedy club's open-mic night, with surprising results.", "rating": "40", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "Frank Whaley", "studio": "NextWednesdayProductions,StonelockPictures", "theater_date": "Dec 13, 2002", "dvd_date": "Apr 4, 2017", "box_office": "$703"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "", "So faithful to the doldrums of the not-quite-urban, not-quite-suburban milieu as to have viewers recoiling from the reality check.", "Rewarding for its brash originality and daring in etching a portrait of a man who refuses to take life's disappointments lying down.", "Whaley's determination to immerse you in sheer, unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting.", "The film, like Jimmy's routines, could use a few good laughs.", "If the movie succeeds in instilling a wary sense of 'there but for the grace of God,' it is far too self-conscious to draw you deeply into its world.", "It may be a somewhat backhanded compliment to say that the film makes the viewer feel like the movie's various victimized audience members after a while, but it also happens to be the movie's most admirable quality", "There's an admirable rigor to Jimmy's relentless anger, and to the script's refusal of a happy ending, but as those monologues stretch on and on, you realize there's no place for this story to go but down.", "Whaley's performance is earnest and often riveting, but he should have taken a few lessons from his peers at amateur night."], "rating": ["3/5", "2/5", "2/4", "3/5", "2/5", "2/4", "2/5", "", "", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["", "Emanuel Levy", "Bill Chambers", "Chris Gore", "Maitland McDonagh", "V.A.
