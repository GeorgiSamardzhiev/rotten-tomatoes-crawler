The cowboys grow fond of Ol' Fooler and, knowing that he is nearly impossible to ride, enter the horse in the rodeo hoping to make their fortune.", "rating": "54", "genre": "Comedy/Western", "runtime": "1h 25m", "director": "Burt Kennedy", "studio": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The movie has wonderful outdoor color photography, better than some done for bigger films.
