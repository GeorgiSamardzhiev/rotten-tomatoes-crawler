{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Royal Tenenbaum and his wife Etheline had three children and then they separated. All three children are extraordinary --- all geniuses. Virtually all memory of the brilliance of the young Tenenbaums was subsequently erased by two decades of betrayal, failure, and disaster. Most of this was generally considered to be their father's fault. \"The Royal Tenenbaums\" is the story of the family's sudden, unexpected reunion one recent winter.", "rating": "80", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Wes Anderson", "studio": "TouchstonePictures,MordecaiFilms,AmericanEmpiricalPictures", "theater_date": "Dec 14, 2001", "dvd_date": "Nov 23, 2015", "box_office": "$52.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The fact that The Royal Tenenbaums is able to maintain a whimsical tone, coupled with profound moments of hurt and loss, and then still have the audacity to be an outright hilarious movie elevates it to something sensational.", "If it sounds bittersweet, it is, but like the best family albums, Tenenbaums is split wide with open-heartedness, and equally generous with its triumphs and failures.", "The Royal Tenenbaums is silly but full of love. It shows that even at their worst, there is always some good in every family...", "Tenenbaums is excellent in its own right but it also serves as a perfect entry point to anyone new to the quirk-filled world of Wes Anderson.", "What really stands out is how rich the story's technical canvas and narrative textures actually are.", "There's so much to like about Wes Anderson's work, and it's hard not to warm to a guy who makes a comedy about damaged young has-beens. But he misfires badly in some crucial respects.", "Suffused with warmth and colour, and making liberal and inventive use of flashbacks, captions, voiceover and even chapter headings to break up the story, The Royal Tenenbaums won't be to everybody's taste, but it is a blast of original, irreverent air.", "With a stellar cast, gorgeous art direction and a surprisingly moving story [The Royal Tenenbaums is], a contender for Anderson's best work to date.", "This comedy-drama about a dysfunctional family of eccentric geniuses is exactly the kind of movie America could use. It's funny, poignant, laced with irresistibly flawed characters and focuses on the power of love in a family.", "The film manages to be both sarcastic and sentimental. As odd as the Tenenbaums are, the family remains bound by love.", "These characters are written with the broad strokes of caricature, yet they are neither funny nor, in the end, sympathetic.", "Anderson truly comes into his own as an original voice with a unique storytelling agenda with this fresh, studiously peculiar film.", "Anderson likes his characters too much to see real cruelty befall them; you likely will too.", "The Tenenbaums's self-referential outlook, wayward agendas, wanton destructiveness and wishful fantasy make for a highly entertaining spectacle, provided you acknowledge you're watching a churning status quo that will never alter in essentials.", "Anderson may yet be the heir to the screwball-comedy throne, but his creative blood needs a fresh infusion.", "Anderson and Wilson have developed into two of the most original voices in American film today. Watching their movies you get the sense that you're peeking into their daydreams.", "With Anderson's images, seductive as they are, we can ultimately only guess -- what Margot's plays are about, or who Etheline's suitors are... And that makes Anderson's film an exhilarating experience, a real jungle gym for the imagination.", "Each character, as ever, is tucked into a shell of his or her obsessions, and yet the filming itself -- the grace of Anderson's draftsmanship, as it were -- binds the figures together into a team.", "Anderson, who collaborated on the script (as in his previous films) with his college buddy Owen Wilson, gives everyone some of the best dialogue heard in a recent movie.", "Wes Anderson is an authentic original -- an eccentric and heretical talent."], "rating": ["", "", "", "A+", "4/5", "", "", "5/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "4/4", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Ed Travis", "Joshua Rothkopf", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Brian Gill", "PJ Nabarro", "Mark Steyn", "Pat Stacey", "Christopher Machell", "Jack Mathews", "Jeff Strickler", "Christopher Tookey", "Dennis King", "Matt Soergel", "Alexander Walker", "Peter Keough", "Christopher Borrelli", "Jonathan Romney", "Anthony Lane", "Lou Lumenick", "Manohla Dargis"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Jesus", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">In These Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Mad About Movies Podcast", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Herald (Ireland)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Minneapolis Star Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Mail (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Florida Times-Union", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Phoenix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Toledo Blade", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sight and Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">L.A.
