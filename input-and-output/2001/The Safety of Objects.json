{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In a suburban landscape, the lives of several families interlace with loss, despair and personal crisis. Esther Gold (Glenn Close) has lost focus on all but caring for her comatose son, Paul (Joshua Jackson), and neglects her daughter (Jessica Campbell) and husband (Robert Klein). Lawyer Jim Train (Dermot Mulroney) is devoted to his career, not his family. Helen Christianson (Mary Kay Place) wants to find a new spark in life, while Annette Jennings (Patricia Clarkson) tries to rebuild hers.", "rating": "50", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 1m", "director": "Rose Troche", "studio": "ClearBlueSkyProductions,RenaissanceFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 13, 2017", "box_office": "$319.1K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["mechanical film school exercise", "Though well-acted, Troche's third film, an adaptation of short stories, is a minor addition of a fractured, ensemble narrative to the overly populated genre of suburban malaise and anomie in the wake of the success of Mendes' Oscar-winner American Beauty", "", "Four neighboring families, seven stories, one secret - one great movie.", "Troche has created a truly moving film, upsetting and uplifting in equal measure.", "...there's a lot worth recommending about the film.", "Simply put, there's too much going on, and too many fragile, damaged characters to fret appropriately over.", "", "A richly compelling movie that is as hard to forget as it is difficult to warm up to.", "The time required to introduce more than a dozen major characters eats into the two-hour film, leaving precious few minutes for development.", "A fairly deft sewing job of short stories by A.M.
