As a massive dragnet starts to pursue them across Texas, the couple become unlikely folk heroes and even start to bond with the captive policeman.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Steven Spielberg", "studio": "UniversalPictures,Zanuck/BrownProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["[The Sugarland Express] has a certain cinematic knack, but is all effect and no real humanity, all manipulation and splash, and no attempt at honest insight.", "It is a decent road movie, which falls for the most trivial melodramatic exposition that Spielberg uses to synthesize the meaning of sacrifice from the perspective of the American family. [Full review in Spanish]", "Spielberg's eye for detail is stated visually rather than through dialogue and the film offers many accurate vignettes of America's obsession with \"heroes\" and heroism.", "Spielberg is a talented director who knows how to dazzle with fancy filmwork. His cast is an attractive one. The problem here is the script.", "A brilliant film from the young Steven Spielberg who was just beginning his career. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The pace falters near the end, but overall this is a brilliantly calculated audience pleaser.", "With this role, Hawn further proves she was an actress of some talent and not just an attractive woman to be taken lightly.", "The set pieces are beautifully handled, grizzled veteran Ben Johnson is watchable as the head cop on their tail, and, looking back, it's clear that Spielberg already held all the aces and knew how to deal them.", "A tragi-comedy in which our modern beasts of burden ultimately exact revenge with horrific panache.", "The Sugarland Express is not terribly original - Bonnie and Clyde, Badlands and The Getaway are indelibly marked in its DNA - but shows an already dazzling young filmmaker honing his skills and vision.", "Steven Spielberg in Malickland, with dolly and zoom and a wagonload of familial issues", "Modest but assured work.", "Unfortunately, the film degenerates in final reels to heavy-handed social polemic and sound-and-fury shootout.", "", "", "Reflecting the zeitgeist of mid-1970s America, this early Spieleberg picture is still one of his strongest, dealing with alienation, anarchy, and lack of control; Goldie Hawn gives an uncharacteristicaly forceful dramatic performance.", "A beautifully put together, assured film.", "One of the most purely fun and slyly political films Spielberg has ever made.
