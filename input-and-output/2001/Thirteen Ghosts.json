{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A state-of-the-art remake of the classic William Castle horror film about a family that inherits a spectacular old house from an eccentric uncle. There's just one problem: the house seems to have a dangerous agenda all its own. Trapped in their new home by strangely shifting walls, the family encounters powerful and vengeful entities that threaten to annihilate anyone in their path.", "rating": "16", "genre": "Horror", "runtime": "1h 31m", "director": "Steve Beck", "studio": "DarkCastleEntertainment,13GhostsProductionsCanadaInc.", "theater_date": "Oct 26, 2001", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2009", "box_office": "$41.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Whereas both versions of Thirteen Ghosts find characters donning special glasses to be able to see the specters, only the remake will lead viewers to wish they had special goggles that would allow them to see a different movie instead.", "...a workable premise that's employed to progressively tedious and downright interminable effect...", "Impressive set design can't quite justify an otherwise choppy, sloppily penned rehash of what could have been an interesting revisit of Castle's penchant for shlocky shocks.", "Shalhoub is well suited to portray Arthur, a lost widower trying to deal with his pain while taking care of his children.", "While the film isn't entirely noteworthy, it solidifies its place among the corny movies from the early 2000's. Cyrus' haunted house is a work of art, and ultimately adds a memorable piece of real estate in the horror genre's spooky neighborhood.", "Elaborate, very expensive and very, very bad, Thir13en Ghosts is filled with ghouls who look like rejects from for Michael Jackson's Thriller video.", "A more fitting tribute to William Castle would have been to create a horror flick you could sit through without consistently squirming in abject loathing.", "It's junk, too, and while maybe it's not as much fun as the original, neither does it disgrace its parent.", "Brutally violent horror remake is a huge waste.", "Still entertaining in spite of its number of faults.", "There isn't enough dry ice in the world to conceal the rot of stupidity hovering over \"13 Ghosts.\" With Embeth Davidtz and Matthew Lillard both overacting to a lower power in supporting roles, there apparently also aren't enough acting coaches.", "Director Beck discards Castle's signature cheeky verve, saddling the film with a poor script rife with hilarious exposition, a literally painful sound design and uniformly bad acting.", "Like the huge glass house that serves as its centerpiece, the film is shiny, sterile, bland, vacuous, and completely pointless.", "In addition to the incredible set that serves as the centerpiece of this film, which is without question its most enjoyable quality, there are also some amazingly truthful performances by Shalhoub, Lillard, and, of course, Abraham.", "This film is a messy jumble.", "Thirteen Ghosts is so bad it scared me more than the Evil Dead knock off ghouls.", "impressionante que 13 Fantasmas tenha sido montado por trs editores, j que a trama (na falta de um termo melhor) flui de maneira absolutamente catica.", "At least his (Castle's) old films could be viewed as pure, innocent camp. Thir13en Ghosts can hardly be viewed at all.", "A loud, stupid and incomprehensible piece of junk", "By any objective accounting, Thirteen Ghosts is exactly a baker's dozen too many -- this is a zero of a film."], "rating": ["2/4", "1/4", "1/5", "3.5/5", "", "", "", "3/5", "2/5", "", "D-", "2/5", "0/5", "4/5", "", "1.5/4", "1/5", "3/10", "1/4", "0/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Matt Brunson", "David Nusair", "Nicholas Bell", "Allison Rose", "Marisa Mirabal", "Sophie Gorman", "Steve Newton", "Ken Hanke", "Nell Minow", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Christopher Smith", "William Thomas", "Brian Mckay", "John R.
