{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Three grown sisters, Maribel (Tamara Mello), Leticia (Elizabeth Pe\u00f1a) and Carmen (Jacqueline Obradors) try to cope and live with their father Martin (H\u00e9ctor Elizondo) ; a veteran chef who is slowly losing his sense of taste. Martin has one simple rule: be at home for Sunday dinner and attendance is both mandatory and non-negotiable. A rift in the family develops when the sisters develop relationships and an obnoxious woman (Raquel Welch) sets her sights on Martin's affections.", "rating": "74", "genre": "Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Maria Ripoll", "studio": "SamuelGoldwynFilms,Starz!EncoreEntertainment", "theater_date": "Aug 24, 2001", "dvd_date": "Oct 9, 2015", "box_office": "$4.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["While this cheerful film has nothing particularly new to say about the ties that hold family members together even when they're driving each other crazy, it's a pleasure to watch such a talented ensemble at work.", "Only some of the characterizations exhibit subtlety, though most of the performances have considerable charm.", "A harmless comedy that will make your mouth water.", "This movie has a lot of heart and soul into it.", "Thanks to a perfectly blended ensemble led by Hector Elizondo, in his best screen role to date, Tortilla Soup is a warm-blooded winner with equal emphasis placed on taste buds and heartstrings.", "Great filmmaking? No, but it's warmly enjoyable and a pleasant way to spend an evening.", "Though the cast are willing, the movie plods along in need of the zingy flavours and hot spices we see going into Elizondo's cooking.", "", "Like a drunken karaoke version of a classic song, this derivative piece of filmmaking does little but blemish our memories of the magic it is trying to copy.", "English-language Mexican-family version of Ang Lee's Eat Drink Man Woman doesn't duplicate the subtleties of the original.", "There's nothing original here, but the film is pleasant enough, and it's a pleasure to see Elizondo on the screen again. Pea, Obradors and Mello are fine as well.", "The romantic foodie movie of the season is upon us, and a delicious dish it is.", "Hector Elizondo lords over his uniquely messed-up offspring with a knowing twinkle in his eye. He's having fun, and so are we.", "Despite a few adjustments, Ripoll's film largely remains faithful to the central plotting of Lee's original film, which presented a slightly familiar yet utterly charming tale of food and families.", "'Tortilla Soup' gives Hector Elizondo the right recipe for his first starring role in a feature film.", "Ang Lee's Eat Drink Man Woman is faithfully adapted into Los Angeles' Mexican-American subculture in this enjoyable ensemble film.", "Isn&#8217;t the delicacy that Eat Drink Man Woman was&#133; But on the level of comfort food this remake is enjoyable enough.", "If your erotic inclinations tilt toward the table, Tortilla Soup will probably offer nothing short of hardcore pleasure. If not, but see it you must, close your eyes and think of other appetites.", "Tortilla Soup is bittersweet fun, but it could have been zanier had Maria Ripoll not directed it with such a ponderous, heavy hand.", "The story gets all hyperactive in the last 20 minutes, but even the predictable stuff can't obliterate the simple pleasure of watching what went before."], "rating": ["3/4", "", "3/5", "3/4", "", "3.5/5", "", "2/5", "2/5", "6/10", "", "3/4", "3.5/5", "3/5", "", "3/5", "C+", "2/4", "3/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Maitland McDonagh", "Lisa Alspector", "Joyce Slaton", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Ken Eisner", "Ken Hanke", "Geoff Andrew", "Emanuel Levy", "", "Jeffrey Chen", "Jean Lowerison", "Margaret A.
