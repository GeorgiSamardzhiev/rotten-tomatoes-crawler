{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Douglas Quaid (Arnold Schwarzenegger) is a bored construction worker in the year 2084 who dreams of visiting the colonized Mars. He visits \"Rekall,\" a company that plants false memories into people's brains, in order to experience the thrill of Mars without having to travel there. But something goes wrong during the procedure; Quaid discovers that his entire life is actually a false memory and that the people who implanted it in his head now want him dead.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Paul Verhoeven", "studio": "TriStarPictures,CarolcoPicturesInc.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 26, 2016", "box_office": "$117.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Forget about the disposable Colin Farrell remake from 2012.", "From the outstandingly inventive prosthetics to the nonstop, volatile hullabaloo piled high with death and laugh-out-loud humor, the film is essential science-fiction viewing.", "Though the movie might make you think twice before embarking on a virtual staycation, Total Recall is ideal \"escapism\" - a big action movie with something to say.", "The film's visual invention is offset by its visceral nastiness. Schwarzenegger's self-deprecatory good humour prevails none the less.", "Suffice it that machines crackle, futureworlds whirl and beings human and animal metamorphose before our eyes. Sci-fl addicts, see and enjoy. Everyone else may await, though not over-eagerly, the video.", "You get the action, the cheese, and some good sci-fi and practical effects. What's not to love?", "Schwarzenegger is never going to make the De Niros and Hoffmans of this world lose a night's sleep, but he has acquired a new confidence as an actor under Verhoeven's guidance.", "Total Recall is slick, sly and subversive, and if some of the special effects have aged somewhat, that only adds to the charm.", "All told, Total Recall is a powerful brew of mordant humor, keen wit, refreshing originality and graphic violence.", "As Quaid, Schwarzenegger continues to stretch beyond his reach as an actor, relying on physical prowess to keep him in character.", "Total Recall went through four directors before Verhoeven finally took it on, and four writers worked on the script. It's no wonder the finished film emerges without a unifying style, or a single performance worth mentioning.", "If the movie sometimes seems overwhelmed by its budget and its legendary third-act problems, it's still entertainingly raw and brutal, full of whiplash pace and juicy exaggeration.", "If Total Recall isn't as much fun as I'd hoped, it's not as dreary as I'd feared. I wouldn't call it totally awesome, but it's far from being a total loss.", "The movie is a cartoon, though a mammothly enjoyable one.", "This rip-roaring slice of sci-fi excess remains Arnold Schwarzenegger's most satisfying film since his breakthrough hit, The Terminator.", "Arnold Schwarzenegger brings an effective blend of machismo and innocence to his role. Too bad director Paul Verhoeven lets brainless violence and tricky special effects swamp the cleverness of the tale itself.", "Total Recall begins to self-destruct not long after Schwarzenegger arrives on Mars, and the story degenerates into a violent, stunningly foul-mouthed enterprise.", "If you don't ask too many questions, or just accept that it's all a dream so logic and science don't matter, then this is an enjoyable romp.", "Paul Verhoeven's version of the original story packs a real sense of intellect and brilliant ambiguity beneath the seemingly surface science fiction action tale...", "A wickedly violent, action-packed old school piece of warped, twist-filled sci-fi and Schwarzenegger cheese. You'll wish you had three hands to hold this one."], "rating": ["5/5", "9/10", "", "", "", "4/5", "3/4", "4/5", "3/4", "2.5/4", "", "", "3/5", "", "4/5", "", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "", "9/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Kevin Maher", "Mike Massie", "Matt Patches", "David Robinson", "Nigel Andrews", "David Hogan", "Desmond Ryan", "Tom Huddleston", "Dennis King", "Johanna Steinmetz", "Bill Kelley", "Michael Wilmington", "Jay Boyar", "Peter Travers", "John Ferguson", "David Sterritt", "Gene Siskel", "Scott Nash", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "R.L.
