To which I'd reply by quoting the translation of the title: who knows?", "For my money, this is a pretentious, overlong (150 minutes), boring film about people for whom living seems to be a chore, and human connection impossible.", "There are a number of fantastic scenes in Va Savoir, but the realities of its characters and their portrayals -- some no doubt a function of a different culture, others undercooked in any language -- undermine its effectiveness.", "A curiosity that's easily forgettable.", "Rivette and his players know that exploring the unanswerable is where the fun and riches lie. Anyone who treasures precisely tuned direction and meaningful dialogue will agree.", "An intelligent, sophisticated hymn to modern-day relationships.", "This might sound terribly convoluted, but on screen it plays out simply and humorously.", "Rivette deftly entertains while intellectually posing conundrums and revealing the complexity of human desires.", "For those people, like me, who do not become engaged by the rambling and plodding story that screenwriters Pascal Bonitzer and Christine Laurent created, the film is sleep-inducing."], "rating": ["", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "A", "", "6/10", "3/4", "4/5", "4/5", "", "C-", "2.5/5", "", "3/4", "4/4", "4/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Chris Chang", "Mark Halverson", "Ken Fox", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Film4 Staff", "Philip French", "Emanuel Levy", "Rob Nelson", "Vadim Rizov", "Susan Tavernetti", "", "Brian Walker", "Jean Lowerison", "Brent Simon", "Christopher Null", "Urban Cinefile Critics", "Andrew Howe", "Jeremy Heilman", "Lisa Stokes", "Bruce Kirkland"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Comment Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sacramento News &amp; Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Observer (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">City Pages, Minneapolis/St. Paul", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie-Vault.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Palo Alto Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ViewLondon", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Diego Metropolitan", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Today", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmcritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Urban Cinefile", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MovieMartyr.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Jam!
