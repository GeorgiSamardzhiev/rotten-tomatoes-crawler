A movie I didn't care for at the time of its release, I now see a lot more of merit in this slasher than I did back in 2001.", "What struck me about Valentine was just how smart the film is, and how it taps into these intriguing female characters and relationships as well, especially at the turn of a new century when there were only the inklings of where our society was headed.", "Valentine is far from perfect, but not a bad film.", "A singularly direct and unchallenging example of the latter-day slasher film, made to a template that was starting to show its age every bit of 20 years before the movie premiered.", "", "Poorly made and just stupid.", "A bland whodunit slasher film starring a bunch of nineties relics...", "", "Yet another one of those films that Scream was supposed to have buried but instead resurrected.", "The contradictory sexual politics in this lightweight slasher suggest that at some point it was meant to satirize the traditional mores of the self-satisfied female characters.", "It doesn't have those scare-the-sh*t out of you moments, and if it doesn't have any of those, what's the point?", "Scary horror flicks went out with the emergence of the self-referential horror movie.", "", "In the new teen slasher flick Valentine, a public-school nerd, now grown up, seeks to systematically murder all the girls who wouldn't dance with him at the Grade 6 Valentine's dance. Or maybe that's not what happens. It s hard to tell.", "The essential daftness isn't helped by the stars, who play it straight when they should have gone for laughs.", "Porno actresses are smarter than this crew!", "I'm not a big fan of horror films, but as they go this isn't a bad one.", "A cheesy horror flick that doesn't take itself too seriously.", "The horror-thriller Valentine makes mistakes where its successful predecessors like Scream didn't, essentially revealing its antagonist in its casting.", "As run-of-the-mill slasher movies go, one of the best to hit screens since the post-Scream boom."], "rating": ["2.5/4", "3.5/5", "2.5/5", "4/10", "D", "1/5", "", "1/5", "1/5", "", "1/5", "2/4", "0/4", "0/4", "1/5", "1.5/5", "", "", "2/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Sara Michelle Fetters", "Heather Wixson", "Zena Dixon", "Tim Brayton", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Ellen MacKay", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Jim Lane", "Rob Gonsalves", "Lisa Alspector", "Eric Lurio", "David Nusair", "Kit Bowen", "Liam Lacey", "Jo Berry", "Brad Laidman", "Jean Lowerison", "", "Annlee Ellingson", "Chuck Rudolph"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MovieFreak.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Dead", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Real Queen of Horror", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sacramento News &amp; Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Greenwich Village Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Globe and Mail", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Diego Metropolitan", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Atlanta Journal-Constitution", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boxoffice Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Matinee Magazine"], "date": ["March 14, 2019", "March 2, 2019", "October 8, 2018", "February 15, 2012", "September 7, 2011", "January 1, 2011", "April 29, 2009", "August 7, 2008", "July 25, 2007", "February 28, 2007", "November 7, 2003", "August 1, 2003", "June 20, 2003", "April 25, 2003", "April 21, 2003", "December 8, 2002", "October 21, 2002", "June 19, 2002", "June 5, 2002", "February 14, 2002"]}}
