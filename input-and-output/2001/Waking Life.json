{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Transcending the boundaries of technology and imagination, \"Waking Life\" is a revolutionary breakthrough in film animation. In \"Waking Life,\" Wiley Wiggins (\"Dazed and Confused\") travels through a series of encounters and observations in a world that may or may not be reality. It is this surreal existence, flourishing with endless ideas and possibilities, that ultimately leads to the question -- Are we sleep-walking through our waking state or wake-walking through our dreams?", "rating": "81", "genre": "Animation/Art House & International/Drama/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "Richard Linklater", "studio": "FatBlackFilms,IndependentFilmChannel,DetourFilmproduction,ThousandWords", "theater_date": "Oct 19, 2001", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$2.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Linklater and his animation collaborators have clearly had a lot of fun, morphing characters into their own conversational subjects, destabilizing their environs, throwing the material world into question.", "It is a dream -or rather a series of waking dreams that slip into one another like those Russian dolls. It also takes computer animation in a new direction.", "Waking Life looks stunning... Animation, thesis, questions!", "a commercial ripoff designed to confuse art-house patrons", "Love-it-or-hate-it film best for older teens.", "A far-out-man poetry slam, art exhibit and imaginative philosophical discourse all at once drifts gently down a stream of consciousness until merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily, \"Waking Life\" is but a dream. Who says existential fiction must be dreary?", "A brilliant film that provokes thought, idea, and conversations within the audience through its surreal animation and incredibly profound conversations.", "", "Form and content fit perfectly: even if the highbrow babbling gets a bit much, the hypnotic animation means that there is always something to watch, like characters suddenly dissolving into smoke or spectacles expanding.", "A true independent film that uses animation techniques to their utmost.", "This inventive animated film, which takes Linklater back to his roots in Austin and Slacker, represents a summation of all the philosophical concerns that have defined him as spokesperson for Gen-X.", "The question comes up often in life: What's your favorite movie? Since October 2001, the answer has been easy and one I shoot back reflexively almost before someone's finished the question: \"Waking Life.\"", "The novelty of the much-lauded animation style wears off about halfway through, with the end result a film that's more interminable than anything else.", "The endless philosophising is a bit sophomoric and more jokes would help, but this is one of a kind that grows more absorbing the longer it runs.", "It is not the best film of the year, nor is it likely to be one that I purchase and watch often. Still, it is something that should be seen by everyone and experienced by any diehard film lover.", "I applaud Linklater for [directing] such an interesting ride. But it suffers from a lack of sensistivity to its audience...", "Linklater's most visually distinctive movie, with exquisitely detailed renderings ... that are at the same time unstable, floaty, in a way perfect for a dreamed reality.", "It reminded me of college.", "This audacious movie may put some people to sleep; for others, it'll be a wakeup call on the possibilities of screen storytelling", "Waking Life takes a peek into that other ninety percent of the possibilities of the cinematic medium that nobody ever explores. Hopefully, others will follow."], "rating": ["", "", "5/5", "D", "4/5", "4/4", "", "4/4", "3.5/5", "5/5", "B+", "4/4", "1/4", "", "4/4", "A-", "", "4/4", "", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["B.
