{"metadata": {"synopsis": "For over 20 years, photojournalist James Nachtwey has been visiting war-torn countries such as Kosovo and Rwanda, capturing the destruction on film. While merely an observer, he still feels the immediate effects of the ravaged lands. The stark images are contrasted by Nachtwey's calm reserve as he fends off accusations of exploiting tragedy. Director Christian Frei attaches a small video camera to Nachtwey's still camera for a bird's-eye view of destruction, pain, and ultimately, hope.", "rating": "80", "genre": "Art House & International/Documentary/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "Christian Frei", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 17, 2020", "box_office": "$34.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "", "Photographs tell stories, and in this case, they tell more than shots of guys looking for photos.", "[There are] moments of breathtaking visual splendor...", "War Photographer is a powerful documentary about a gifted and idealistic peace maker in a world torn by conflict, pain and suffering.", "", "A worthy tribute to a man and his colleagues who risk their lives to bring us the true story of the world.", "Intriguing Oscar-nominated documentary.", "This film is an act of spiritual faith -- an eloquent, deeply felt meditation on the nature of compassion.", "Both the film and Nachtwey's photos hammer home the grim reality of the world's gutters and battlefields, and will make you question what 'news' really is.", "It's almost too much to watch, and, frankly, I dare anyone to sit through this movie without having to leave the theatre.", "If you ever wondered what it would be like to be smack in the middle of a war zone armed with nothing but a camera, this Oscar-nominated documentary takes you there.", "It's as close as we'll ever come to looking through a photographer's viewfinder as he works.", "A film at once depressing and uplifting--depressing in terms of the sad, often horrifying subjects of Nachtwey's photographs but uplifting in terms of his commitment and integrity.", "Uplifting as only a document of the worst possibilities of mankind can be, and among the best films of the year.", "Watching War Photographer, you come to believe that Nachtwey hates the wars he shows and empathizes with the victims he reveals.", "Although commentary on Nachtwey is provided ... it's the image that really tells the tale.", "In the second half of the film, Frei's control loosens in direct proportion to the amount of screen time he gives Nachtwey for self-analysis.", "Nachtwey clears the cynicism right out of you.
