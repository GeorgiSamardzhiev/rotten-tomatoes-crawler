{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Propelled to the top of the fashion world by a photogenic gaze he calls \"Blue Steel,\" dimwitted male model Derek Zoolander (Ben Stiller) thinks he's got a fourth consecutive win as Male Model of the Year in the bag. But, when his rival, Hansel (Owen Wilson), unexpectedly takes the crown, Derek is crushed. He becomes easy prey for fashion designer Jacobim Mugatu (Will Ferrell), who signs Derek to star in his \"Derelicte\" fashion show, then brainwashes him to kill Malaysia's prime minister.", "rating": "63", "genre": "Comedy/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 29m", "director": "Ben Stiller", "studio": "TenthPlanetProductions,ParamountPictures,RedHourProductions,ScottRudinProductions", "theater_date": "Sep 28, 2001", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$45.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This project is almost too silly for words.", "In a world where so few comedies make me laugh anymore, this one made me hysterical.", "Zoolander offers the breathless revelation that show business is a vain and hollow place.", "'Zoolander' is a fairly representative sample of the eclectic nature of Stiller's talent as a filmmaker.

Not so in \"Zoolander,\" which is not only Cuba Gooding Jr. and Billy Zane's best work of the last decade, but what remains Stiller's flat-out funniest film - down to the DVD menu.", "", "A fashion spoof draped over the bones of a puerile conspiracy adventure, this vanity comedy fails at every level barring its incidental details.", "It's patchy, but when it hits, Zoolander is as funny as any Frat Pack picture.", "At times Zoolander threatens to disappear up its own catwalk, but it's often very funny stuff.", "This light silly and fluffy satire of the fashion industry targets for a change not the female but male models.", "A success -- if you like dumb fun.", "Stiller ... is able to demonstrate contempt for the folly of the Industry of Image even as he shows affection for the people that are in it.", "Some funny moments, but misses a chance to really skewer its subject.", "There are cameos galore and you get the feeling that everyone had a ball making the movie.
