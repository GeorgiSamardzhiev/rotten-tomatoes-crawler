{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Manchester, 1976. Tony Wilson (Steve Coogan) is an ambitious but frustrated local TV news reporter looking for a way to make his mark. After witnessing a life-changing concert by a band known as the Sex Pistols, he persuades his station to televise one of their performances, and soon Manchester's punk groups are clamoring for him to manage them. Riding the wave of a musical revolution, Wilson and his friends create the legendary Factory Records label and The Hacienda club.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 57m", "director": "Michael Winterbottom", "studio": "Miramax", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$1.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It may not be all true, necessarily, but it's super entertaining, and that's what matters in the end, right?", "", "Tony Wilson's and \"24-Hour Party People's\" tossed-off philosophy was that the worst of times, like the best, pass away - never truer than in the fickle music industry. A free-form view of a freefall where artifice and artistry tumbled head over heels.", "Excellent movie about punk's origins; older teens only.", "", "Those wishing for a full-on, comprehensive look at the era will be disappointed, but Winterbottom, Coogan, and Boyce serve up a vivid and lively thumbnail sketch.", "When it comes to capturing music in a visual medium, 24 Hour Party People ranks right up there with Martin Scorsese's 1978 rock documentary, The Last Waltz.", "24 Hour Party People is a frenzied, metafilmic, postmodern splatter of a homage to a music movement . . . a jolting, raucous ride into the celluloid distance.'", "Those who can't tell their Johnny Rotten's from their Right Said Fred's will be entertained by Coogan's charmingly relaxed turn and Frank Cottrell Boyce's ardent script.", "A light and playful look at the Manchester music scene which spans from the punk explosion to the dawn of acid house.", "", "", "It is probably entertaining if you are at least remotely interested in, or knowledgeable about, punk music or the rave scene. If not, forget it.", "From a pure structure standpoint, 24 Hour Party People is extremely interesting and original. Surprisingly slow moving, however.", "This is Cult Movie Central -- and there's no livelier tour guide than Michael Winterbottom.", "Steve Coogan makes a likeable enough narrator, and director Michael Winterbottom uses enough cinematic tricks to keep things interesting. Still, for those not in the know, 24 Hour Party People can seem 24 hours long.", "Director Michael Winterbottom has pulled off an inspired act of self-referencing, post-modern filmmaking that does these people, their attitude, their home, their music, and their legacy proud.", "Brilliantly realised and hilariously funny.", "", "Fans of that period of music should see the film post-haste; others may enjoy it purely from a filmmaking perspective, in which category it succeeds pretty well."], "rating": ["", "B", "3.5/4", "4/5", "4/5", "3/4", "3.5/4", "", "B", "", "4/5", "8/10", "C", "2/5", "4/5", "2.5", "3.5/4", "4/5", "4/5", "B-"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Chris Ludovici", "Emanuel Levy", "Nick Rogers", "Nell Minow", "", "Michael Dequina", "Judith Egerton", "Brian Gibson", "Sean O&#39;Connell", "Eric Henderson", "", "Dragan Antulov", "Robert Roten", "Karina Montgomery", "Tim Merrill", "Matt Easterbrook", "Mark Dujsik", "Jamie Russell", "Matthew Turner", "Eric D.
