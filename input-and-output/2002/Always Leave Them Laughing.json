When the famous Eddy Eagen (Bert Lahr) falls ill, Cooper seizes the opportunity to fill in for him. Luckily, he already knows Eagen's act, but his commitment to the show -- and to his pretty dance partner -- causes trouble between Cooper and his fianc\u00e9e, Fay (Ruth Roman).", "rating": "", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Roy Del Ruth", "studio": "WarnerBrothers/SevenArts", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["[Berle] remains on the screen for nearly two hours, pulling every stunt imaginable.
