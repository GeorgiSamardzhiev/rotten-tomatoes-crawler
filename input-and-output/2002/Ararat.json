Egoyan has dedicated so much time and feeling to the historical wounds of his race that the emotion is festering.", "Because of Egoyan's astute, cool intellectual powers and directorial finesse, the film cannot be quickly dismissed, especially if you're an Egoyan disciple. You do become concerned about the characters . . and the issues. If only you could feel them.", "A disappointingly convoluted attempt to present the 1915 Armenian genocide through an intergenerational family melodrama.", "Great idea. Execution poor enough to compare it to a Lifetime/VisionTV Movie of the Week.", "Verges on the brilliant and is a much more interesting work than Egoyan's admirable but over-praised The Sweet Hereafter.", "", "", "[Egoyan is] so careful telling the story of the genocide that much of the film feels cold and didactic, like watching a slide show in a lecture hall.", "One of Egoyan's great pics that in time will grow in stature.", "Although not an easy film to follow, I found 'Ararat' worthy of close attention.", "The movie's flaws ring of underconfidence, as if Egoyan intellectualised its parts until he ended up draining them of power.", "It's not easy to shake or dismiss.", "Exploring the fluid nature of history ... [is] a fascinating conceit, but one Egoyan has trouble executing.", "There's no doubting that this is a highly ambitious and personal project for Egoyan, but it's also one that, next to his best work, feels clumsy and convoluted.", "Ararat feels like a book report", "Egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement, and, if you'll excuse a little critical heresy, too intellectually ambitious.", "Atom Egoyan has conjured up a multilayered work that tackles any number of fascinating issues", "A haunted, bountiful film that demands patience -- and rewards it.", "The work of an artist tormented by his heritage, using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims.", "Impassioned performances and direction make this a riveting recreation of a reprehensible period neglected by historians."], "rating": ["", "", "C", "C", "4/5", "3.5/5", "3/5", "2.5/5", "A", "", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "3/5", "1.5/4", "C", "", "4/5", "3.5/4", "8/10"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Alexander Walker", "Brandon Judell", "Emanuel Levy", "Jason Gorber", "Ken Hanke", "", "", "Josh Bell", "Dennis Schwartz", "Betty Jo Tucker", "Ian Mantgani", "Jeff Vice", "Sean P.
