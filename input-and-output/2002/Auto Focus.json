{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A successful TV star during the 1960s, former \"Hogan's Heroes\" actor Bob Crane (Greg Kinnear) projects a wholesome family-man image, but this front masks his persona as a sex addict who records and photographs his many encounters with women, often with the help of his seedy friend, John Henry Carpenter (Willem Dafoe). This biographical drama reveals how Crane's double life takes its toll on him and his family, and ultimately contributes to his death.", "rating": "71", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Paul Schrader", "studio": "PropagandaFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$2.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The technical aspects of the film are quite on the money.", "For all its tantalizing forays into the narcotic, head-swimming loss of self and perspective in addiction, Auto Focus never quite extends its sympathy to its characters or convinces us that they are real people.", "The movie's themes are aptly captured in the double entendre of the title, suggesting both Crane's narcissism and the video technology that abets it...a lot of Auto Focus is coolly funny--it's a slyly satiric comedy of '60s manners.", "The film isn't the least bit erotic, or prurient - or even interesting.", "What makes the material work so well here is the perception that both writer and director choose to execute with its protagonist, which is not to provide overlying sympathy for him or his choices.", "", "Ultimately one-dimensional and superficial look into the life of Bob Crane...", "A repetitive and disappointingly shallow look at what is in fact an intriguing Hollywood mystery.", "", "Out of focus.", "", "", "", "Sempre fascinante, o filme traz Greg Kinnear e Willem Dafoe em performances absolutamente impecveis.", "See it for Kinnear's performance, see it for a supreme depiction of the time, but don't go in expecting Citizen Kane. More like Deep Throat.", "Another probing case history of male pathology from one of the most consistently interesting American film-makers alive.", "Given its lurid subject matter, the film is astoundingly bland.", "Crane's story is a modern Hollywood tragedy, and Schrader and Kinnear treat it with the utmost respect, creating a film that is both touching and bittersweet.", "..interesting for the way it reveals what the advent of the videotape in the '70s has done to all of us.
