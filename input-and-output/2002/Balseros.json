{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A public television crew joined Cuban nationals in 1994 for this insightful documentary about their harrowing escape on a raft, their incarceration at the U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay and their transition to life in the United States. When the rafters, known as \"balseros,\" finally arrived in the U.S., they spread out to a string of cities. Seven years later, the filmmakers reconnected with their subjects to see what progress they had made in their pursuit of the American Dream.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Art House & International/Documentary/Drama/Special Interest", "runtime": "2h", "director": "Carles Bosch, Josep Maria Dom\u00e8nech", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 26, 2005", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Despite the heroic exertions of the rafters and filmmakers, this apolitical film is oddly lacking in drama.", "", "Here are a handful of fairly ordinary people who happen to be from a crippled island with a deteriorating economy, who earn our sympathy just by being themselves.", "Focuses its attention on telling a series of individual, human stories, refreshingly leaving the history lessons for the classroom.", "A movie that shows normal life can be as tough, and as gripping, as rowing across a dangerous ocean.", "Relates such amazing journeys that it's hard not to get emotionally involved.", "A heart-rending account of people trying to dodge the hurdles that politics puts in front of them.", "A seven-year time lapse that's full of drama, poignancy and some heartbreaking moments.", "Hangs on to a sense of hope and promise, even in the face of disaster, that can only come from the people themselves.", "The documentary is remarkable in how it personalized this human tragedy.", "Well-done documentary.", "Illustrates the pain and anguish of the 1994 Cuban rafter exodus.", "Poignant, spirited, revealing.", "Despite its unique Cuban elements, Balseros gets much of its power from the way it turns out to be a classic story of immigrants coming to a golden land and finding the streets paved with baser materials.", "Old news for anyone who has seen even one or two documentaries on similar subject matter.", "While uneven, occasionally confusing and rough-edged, the documentary achieves a rare depth and intimacy in its portrait of dreams fulfilled and shattered.", "Once viewers get to know the balseros as individuals, rather than by a label thrust upon them by desperate circumstances, it's interesting to see how close to -- or far from -- their dreams the American experience takes them.", "Hats off to directors Carles Bosch and Josep M.
