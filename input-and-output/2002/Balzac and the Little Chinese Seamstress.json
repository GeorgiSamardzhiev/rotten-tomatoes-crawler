{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the early 1970s, teenage friends Ma Jianling (Ye Liu) and Luo Min (Chen Kun) are forced to move to a remote mountain village for re-education during China's Cultural Revolution. Luo falls in love with a beautiful girl known as the Little Seamstress (Zhou Xun), who thirsts for the Western music and literature that the village chief (Chen Tianlu) considers insufficiently Maoist. The friends read to her from a cache of suppressed European literature that opens her mind to new possibilities.", "rating": "77", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Sijie Dai", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 27, 2005", "box_office": "$665.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The ethereal private moments and inspired passages are beautifully shot by Jean-Marie Dreujou, but Dai never quite organizes the material dramatically, and the tone is too often jagged and disruptive.", "A dullish though quite watchable lyrical coming-of-age love triangle drama set in the 1970s during the Chinese Cultural Revolution.", "Anyone expecting something either insightful or unusual will be disappointed.", "", "", "will appeal primarily to literary and artistic mentalities", "The film is episodic, and most of the scenes are evocative and charming.", "Seamstress doesn't inspire the same kind of fervent devotion its principals feel when confronted with art, but it does make a pleasant enough diversion.", "A number of memorable set pieces illuminate the world around this subdued romantic triangle.", "Skillfully done...but the broader historical context may make one just a tad queasy reveling in its visual and emotional excesses.", "[A] tribute to the transforming power of books.", "Beautifully photographed, Balzac is a sometimes edgy journey that lands gently, but effectively on the mind.", "A nifty little film about the powers of culture and the humanities.", "[A] big, beautifully photographed and somewhat mushy film.", "[A] charmer.", "The three main characters make a fabulous threesome - they settle into a very comfortable arrangement even though you can feel the sexual tension just under the surface.", "The movie may lose some of its bite when translated from page to screen, but it still delivers a valid message.
