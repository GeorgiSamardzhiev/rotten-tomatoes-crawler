{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Who's afraid of the big bad Wolf? Not Jason Shepherd (Frankie Muniz), who has to prove that sleazy Hollywood producer Marty Wolf (Paul Giamatti) stole his class paper and turned it into a blockbuster hit movie, \"Big Fat Liar.\" Traveling to Los Angeles with his best friend Kaylee (Amanda Bynes), Jason tries to break into show business -- literally. Through a hilarious series of pranks and ruses, Jason brings one of Hollywood's most powerful producers to his knees.", "rating": "44", "genre": "Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Shawn Levy", "studio": "Tollin/RobbinsProductions,MediastramFilm", "theater_date": "Feb 8, 2002", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$47.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Although aimed at kids, adults will find Big Fat Liar just as entertaining, giving them a chance to reacquaint themselves with their own \"kid within.\" Goofy, adorable and laughable.

That alone earns it a place in the list of genuinely funny comedies for kids.", "Even adults will appreciate the comedy, and making a film that gets the whole family chuckling is tougher than it sounds.", "It's crafty, energetic and smart -- the kid is sort of like a fourteen-year old Ferris Bueller.", "It's more enjoyable than I expected, though, and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs.
