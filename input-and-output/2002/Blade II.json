{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Exploding from the pages of Marvel Comics comes the thrilling follow-up to the blockbuster \"Blade.\" Half Man ... half vampire, and consumed by a desire to avenge the curse of his birth and save the human race from a blood-drenched Armageddon. In this newest action-packed adventure, Blade (Wesley Snipes) is forced to team up with the very vampires he hates in order to overcome a new type of monster which threatens to eradicate both races.", "rating": "57", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Horror", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "Guillermo del Toro", "studio": "AmenRaFilms,ImaginaryForces", "theater_date": "Mar 22, 2002", "dvd_date": "Jan 3, 2012", "box_office": "$81.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Blade II is an incredibly upbeat picture, and rather than focus on Blade's loneliness or how he's humanity's protector and yet can never truly be one of them, del Toro gleefully jumps into the action scenes.", "The plot is essentially Blade fighting a bunch of people, then talking to a bunch of people, then fighting a bunch of people, then talking to a bunch of people, and keep repeating. Over and over.", "The best installment of the saga and one of the clearest examples of the splendid handling of the cinematographic narrative treasured by the Mexican filmmaker. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Blade, the protagonist of Blade II, takes his blade and shampoo factory to Prague, where many a super vampire are blade adieu.", "There's no script to speak of, but del Toro devises every battle to wow even the most jaded martial-arts mavens; the dissolutions and implosions are beautiful.", "Basically, the sequel replays the original movie's set pieces with even more gore and less coherence.", "Blade II is certainly not without interest... But mostly, it looks and feels so much like a video game that some members of the audience will feel their thumbs twitching before the final reel.", "In the inventive fight scenes, [Blade's] sword clangs, and there are sluicing sounds when it finds its target, all in keeping with the unapologetic bang! blam! pop! comic-book spin director Guillermo Del Toro brings to the film.", "The original Blade movie was a chilling, gory vampire story, energetic and stylish -- all in all, a bloodthirsty success. The second one's chaotic and dumb and almost completely without thrills.", "Del Toro's aim is brutally simple: to give your adrenalin glands a bootcamp work-out. Granted, the spin-dry visuals and hectic tempo mean the style is the content -- but what style, what energy and what a bloody great sequel.", "It's a fabulous-looking package, elegantly orchestrated by del Toro, who has an unerring eye for undead iconography, which he takes to visually imaginative extremes.", "It is directed by Guillermo del Toro: by \"directed\" I simply mean he turned his camerawork over to the computer graphics surgeons who cut, slice, dice and vivisect the material to mount a gross eyeassault of CG sequences.", "Del Toro is a stylish horrormeister, and he has created an evocative, foreboding atmosphere. But only a fan of this kind of mayhem could find a way into the story. And only a critic, sworn to serve, could stick it out to the end.", "The frenetic fight scenes are too fast for non-vampire eyes, but those familiar with the original should find plenty to like.", "No one seems to be having much fun, with the possible exception of Kris Kristofferson, who is back as Blade's venerable human sidekick, Whistler. The film finds few variations on the themes of run, kick, chomp and gulp.", "The world can always use another entertainingly trashy B-movie, and Blade II fits the bill.", "Blade II is a better vampire movie than recent entries such as Queen of the Damned or Dracula 2000. That said, Wesley Snipes' return as slayer of the undead still is fairly anemic.", "Del Toro has Blade II timed to the emotional beat, and it flows from track to track like your favorite CD mix.", "Icky, bloody vampire sequel.", "\"Twilight\" popularly defined vampire cinema in the Zeroes. But Team Blade could execute every last sullen Cullen. When Blade turns full vampire - suplexing and flying-elbow-dropping people like a crazy Mexican luchador - 'tis pure fanboy nirvana."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "1/4", "2/4", "", "2/4", "4/5", "3/5", "", "1.5/4", "3/4", "", "", "", "8/10", "2/5", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Matt Goldberg", "Germain Lussier", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Leona Laurie", "David Edelstein", "Michael Sragow", "John Wooley", "Leah Rozen", "Matt Soergel", "", "Alan Jones", "Alexander Walker", "Jack Mathews", "Alex Kaloostian", "Joe Morgenstern", "Nathan Rabin", "David Germain", "Steve Head", "Nell Minow", "Nick Rogers"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Collider", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">io9.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Geek Girl Authority", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slate", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Florida Times-Union", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IGN Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Yap"], "date": ["October 18, 2018", "October 18, 2018", "October 18, 2018", "August 29, 2018", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "December 22, 2010", "September 25, 2010"]}}
