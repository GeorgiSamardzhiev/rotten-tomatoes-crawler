{"metadata": {"synopsis": "FBI profiler Terry McCaleb (Clint Eastwood) was hot on the trail of \"The Code Killer\" when a heart attack put him out of commission. A heart transplant later, Terry spends his time in the harbor on his houseboat -- that is, until he starts to investigate the facts surrounding his transplant. His donor was a murder victim, and the murder is still unsolved. With the help of his seaside neighbor, Buddy (Jeff Daniels), and over the protests of his doctor, Terry reopens the case.", "rating": "52", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Clint Eastwood", "studio": "MalpasoCompany", "theater_date": "Aug 9, 2002", "dvd_date": "Nov 1, 2009", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Mediocre crime pot-boiler from Clint Eastwood in actor-director mode.", "This vehicle&mdash;the cinematic equivalent of a supermarket paperback&mdash;plays like the best-ever episode of Matlock rather than a truly distinguished feature film.
