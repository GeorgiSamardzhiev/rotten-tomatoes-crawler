{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Political documentary filmmaker Michael Moore explores the circumstances that lead to the 1999 Columbine High School massacre and, more broadly, the proliferation of guns and the high homicide rate in America. In his trademark provocative fashion, Moore accosts Kmart corporate employees and pleads with them to stop selling bullets, investigates why Canada doesn't have the same excessive rate of gun violence and questions actor Charlton Heston on his support of the National Rifle Association.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Documentary/Special Interest", "runtime": "2h", "director": "Michael Moore", "studio": "DogEatDogFilms,UnitedBroadcastingInc.,SalterStreetFilmsInternational", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 17, 2017", "box_office": "$21.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An extremely effective, if not rambling film that asks the question \"Are we (America) a nation of gun nuts, or are we just nuts?\"", "Though Moore's style and biases have often been called into question, Bowling for Columbine diagnosed America's gun problem...", "Readers of these pages need no introduction to Michael Moore, nor will they require any acrobatics on my part to go see Bowling for Columbine, which is (brace yourselves) pretty terrific.", "The most striking thing about Michael Moore's 2002 documentary, Bowling for Columbine, is how painfully relevant it still is.", "hits us with hard truths and thought-provoking inquiry while also making us laugh", "Whatever, dude.
