It's almost as if Zeffirelli ... has dug up a late-'70s time capsule to share with the world.", "Justifies its dismissal of factual truth in favor of a deeper sort.", "Nothing more than Zeffirelli's wish-fulfillment, pretending to stage a production of 'Carmen' with Fanny Ardant acting as proxy for his late, great star.", "Zeffirelli is in his element celebrating Callas' glory and lushly staging Carmen. Alas, the rest of the movie... falls flat.", "Though for opera buffs the result may well be fun, it's also camp with a high C....Douglas Sirk and Ross Hunter, eat your hearts out.", "Little of it works, and frankly, the film alternates between being dull and being almost campy fun.", "Bravura performances by all. Fanny Ardant shines as the woman in desperate need of a spotlight.", "For Callas fans, this is a winner. For others, it should at least be interesting.", "The film's portrait of the singer is indelible. The story as a whole, however, doesn't hold together, primarily because the imaginary characters and situations that surround her are so inadequately sketched.", "Callas may be forever, but Franco Zeffirelli's fictionalized tribute is not.", "Achieves some briskly intimate entertainment on its odd terms.", "A film that forgets to bring its central character to life."], "rating": ["4/5", "2/5", "3.5/5", "3.5/5", "3.5/5", "2/4", "2/5", "", "3.5/4", "", "C", "2/4", "C+", "2/4", "3.5/5", "A-", "3/4", "", "2.5/4", "C"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Ken Hanke", "", "", "", "James Wegg", "John Beifuss", "Steve Davis", "Robert W.
