{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A rush-hour fender-bender on New York City's crowded FDR Drive, under most circumstances, wouldn't set off a chain reaction that could decimate two people's lives. But on this day, at this time, a minor collision will turn two complete strangers into vicious adversaries. Their means of destroying each other might be different, but their goals, ultimately, will be the same: Each will systematically try to dismantle the other's life in a reckless effort to reclaim something he has lost.", "rating": "77", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Roger Michell", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "Apr 12, 2002", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$66.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Emotionally violent thriller for mature teens.", "\"Changing Lanes\" asks how far we'd go not to lose what's ours, but it's a morality play with hope for dtente rather than any destructive force.

An extraordinary film with a level of moral complexity and attention to detail that are rare today ...", "How often do you go to a Hollywood movie and still find yourself thinking about it on the way to work the next day?", "Changing Lanes is a good movie built on a dumb premise. But it's a good movie all the same.", "Despite its strong start with a plausible situation gone disastrously wrong, Changing Lanes lectures audiences and devolves into the corniest of melodramas--there's nothing subtle about it.", "", "While Roger Michell's film does indeed take a bad detour in its home stretch, it is on the whole a brisk and absorbing morality play.", "It's a bit contrived, but this is a strongly acted two-hander...", "Inside the film's conflict-powered plot there is a decent moral trying to get out, but it's not that, it's the tension that keeps you in your seat.
