{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Nightclub sensation Velma (Catherine Zeta-Jones) murders her philandering husband, and Chicago's slickest lawyer, Billy Flynn (Richard Gere), is set to defend her. But when Roxie (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger) also winds up in prison, Billy takes on her case as well -- turning her into a media circus of headlines. Neither woman will be outdone in their fight against each other and the public for fame and celebrity.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Rob Marshall", "studio": "Miramax,StorylineEntertainment,ProducersCircle", "theater_date": "Jan 24, 2003", "dvd_date": "Apr 21, 2016", "box_office": "$170.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The brisk tempo never slows and the visuals never lose their luster.", "...Chicago is another spectacular spectacular filled with enough razzamattazz, razzle dazzle, all that jazz and then some, all guaranteed to place Hollywood back at the top of the heap as king of the movie musical.", "This jaw-dropping, mouth-watering, heart-stopping film version of the spectacular Fosse stage show takes all the best bits from the musical and enhances every scene.", "It's a high-wire act energized by its stars' amazement at their own reckless effrontery, a brash blast, and an original sight in a cinema cancerous with cautious recyclings.", "If this production from first-time director Rob Marshall doesn't single-handedly revive the musical as a viable genre in Hollywood, then the musical deserves to stay dead.", "Chicago's so engrossing that you even forget to reach out for the Coke n' popcorn. Now isn't that entertainment!", "Marshall doesn't doggedly follow Fosse. He uses scenes from many other musicals. Chicago is, among other things, a collection of fan's notes by a boy crazy about the form.", "Chicago is supposed to be cynical about showbiz, not embarrassed by it. Oh, well. There'll be another film musical along around 2008.", "Does Rob Marshall really think this is the way to shoot musical? [Full Review in Spanish]", "I recommend Chicago.", "In effect it is filmed theatre, but this brings its own compensations: the more fake Chicago looks, the more real it seems to get.", "What makes this more than a film of a great stage show is the way that the action spills seamlessly from the stage sets into real life. Magic.", "Whatever one's qualms about the material, its execution here is rock solid in ways that keep on impressing, right through to the niftiest end credits sequence in years.", "As a reproduction of the stage show, Chicago isn't bad, but it makes no persuasive case for itself as a film.", "Marshall and company have given the old genre a swift, vigorous kick in the pants. Chicago is one movie that won't let us down; it's our kind of town.", "You know you have just witnessed a good musical when you leave the theatre or cinema with one, or more, of its songs still ringing in your head.... But after seeing Chicago, I did not whistle or tap my way home.", "Bawdy, funny and exhilarating, Chicago is great entertainment.", "Chicago may not rank with the classics, but it's the best traditional movie musical in many a moon.", "Perhaps someone should have reminded Rob Marshall that framing, camera angles, and edit points have meaning beyond the provision of eye candy to dissipate potential audience distraction.", "In both concept and execution, Chicago is the real thing, and may someday be remembered with the very best of its genre."], "rating": ["8/10", "", "4/5", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "1/5", "", "", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "4.5/5", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Sky Staff", "Tim Appelo", "Christopher Borrelli", "Namrata Joshi", "Hilton Als", "Mark Steyn", "Diana Albizu", "Dan Savage", "Barbara Ellen", "James Christopher", "Tim Robey", "Anthony Quinn", "Dennis King", "Cosmo Landesman", "David Stratton", "Sam Adams", "Lesley M.
