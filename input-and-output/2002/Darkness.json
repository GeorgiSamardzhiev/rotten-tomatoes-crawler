As the supernatural occurrences get more intense and threatening, Regina looks into the house's dark history and struggles to uncover the reason behind the macabre presence.", "rating": "4", "genre": "Horror", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Jaume Balaguer\u00f3", "studio": "DimensionFilms,FantasticFactory(Filmax),ViaDigital", "theater_date": "Dec 25, 2004", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$22.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Nothing even remotely interesting occurs.", "There's the draw from the audience of potential scares and the good cast, but there's nothing ever delivered to us.", "This baffling, unintentionally sidesplitting horror show has opened just in time to qualify as the worst film of the year.", "...ultimately comes off as nothing less than a total disaster.", "All of this, of course, would be forgivable if it added up to a scary movie or made even a lick of sense (chunks appear to have been cut out of a longer cut of the film), but Balaguero manages to disappoint on every possible front.", "As in most bad horror flicks, intimations of unspeakable evil are supposed to distract us from the yawning gaps in story logic and character motivation.", "Even as the darkness closes in, there is never any real sense of dread. The slow-burning terror soon fizzles out, as does the damp squib of an ending.", "Back to horror school for you, Seor Balaguer.", "A plodding, portentous horror thriller in which a spooky child figures prominently and people speak in hushed tones about sinister doings.", "Darkness is a by-the-numbers haunted house thriller that recalls a number of other films in which a family moves into a mysterious old manse with a sordid past", "There's still a lot of European feel to Darkness, which can sometimes be off-putting to American audiences.", "Too many plot and character lapses for comfort, even in the traditionally logic-flouting horror genre.", "It's unfortunate that the film is called Darkness because this means it will soon be relegated to the Wal Mart bargain bin next to 2003's stinker Darkness Falls.", "A good case of style over substance.", "The film is dark, and a bit slowly paced in parts, but it's worth watching.", "There's nothing very frightening about this shallow, stupid spookfest.", "The movie finally degenerates into a hopeless mass of mumbo-jumbo, silliness, and incoherence.", "However, the fact that the creepy suspenseful atmosphere builds up to a risible climax where nothing remotely scary happens undermines all the good work that has gone before.", "Darkness is a ridiculous film choked with genre clichs and stolen scares, yet there's something genuinely dark and nasty wrapped inside all that ridiculousness...", "incomprehensibly opaque and moronically over-projected"], "rating": ["1.5/4", "", "1/5", "", "2/4", "", "", "2/5", "", "", "2.5/5", "2/4", "D-", "2.5/4", "2/5", "D", "4/10", "2/5", "", "1.5/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Matt Brunson", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Mark Halverson", "David Nusair", "Ken Fox", "J.
