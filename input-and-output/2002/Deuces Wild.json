Just fill in the blanks and you too can brew the same bland, goopy mixture.", "A flashback to a heroin casualty on a rain-soaked playground is a crucial visual aid, but any punch-drunk victim of Deuces Wild might prefer the needle to the damage done.", "This is a movie that can't say no to a melodramatic opportunity, and whatever verisimilitude inspired Paul Kimatian and Christopher Gambale to write a script based on Kimatian's memories of the gangs has been utterly lost along the way.", "Slow-motion shots of swaggering tough guys punctuate this painfully hackneyed gang drama set in late-50s Brooklyn.", "The script from first-timers Paul Kimatian and Christopher Gambale requires Dillon to say corny things like: 'Bricks don't fall outta the sky in this neighborhood unless I'm throwin' 'em.' Tony Soprano, he ain't.", "What died in here, and who can we call to take its carcass away?", "If it was the intention of Kalvert, Gambale and Kimatian to infiltrate their script with every stereotypical hoodlum clich from every movie covering Brooklyn bad boys, they were on the money. Too bad their movie isn't.", "Tentando desesperadamente se transformar em uma espcie de O Selvagem da Motocicleta do novo milnio (com toques de Amor, Sublime Amor), o filme  esquemtico demais, tornando-se artificial e nada envolvente.", "With a couple of plot twists and a few powerful performances, Deuces Wild is worth checking out -- but only on home video.", "I accuse films of being generic and unoriginal on a regular basis, but rarely have I seen a movie so determined to check off every clich on the list as Deuces Wild.", "Astonishing isn't the word -- neither is incompetent, incoherent or just plain crap. Indeed, none of these words really gets at the very special type of badness that is Deuces Wild.", "Despite its best intentions, Deuces Wild is an empty hand.", "Both half-hearted and half-assed"], "rating": ["", "", "2/4", "", "", "", "1/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "2/5", "2.5/5", "D+", "", "3/10", "C-"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Loren King", "Alex Kaloostian", "Leah Rozen", "James Keith La Croix", "Nathan Rabin", "Jack Mathews", "Gene Seymour", "Jessica Winter", "Robert Koehler", "J.
