En route, their midlife crisis turns into a midnight crisis when they get lost in Tokyo's neon jungle and can't find the way back to their hotel. It's down and out in Asia's brave new world. With no credit cards, directions, and with no Yen in their pockets, they wander through an alien environment where the simplest everyday thing becomes a major, if often comical, challenge.", "rating": "62", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Doris D\u00f6rrie", "studio": "", "theater_date": "Jun 8, 2001", "dvd_date": "Sep 24, 2002", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Dorrie manages to keep the film, and her characters, on track.", "", "With its lack of visual artistry and its overabundance of expository dialogue, I was bored not long after it began.", "Doris Dorrie obviously loves these guys, not in spite of their foibles and failings, but, oddly, because of them.", "", "", "", "Sometimes movies transcend their descriptions.
