{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A director, Ian (Rufus Sewell), brings his crew to the Alps to film a group of extreme-sports practitioners for a television commercial. But, over the course of the shoot, the thrill seekers get more than they bargained for when they stumble on the hideout of a Serbian warlord, Pavlov (Klaus Lowitsch), and his terrorist goons. After they unintentionally get the warlord on film, a gnarly chase begins, and they find themselves experiencing a whole new kind of thrill.", "rating": "7", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Christian Duguay", "studio": "ParamountPictures,DiamantCohenProductions,MDPWorldwide", "theater_date": "Nov 27, 2002", "dvd_date": "Jun 9, 2017", "box_office": "$4.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Good extreme snowboarding, poor everything else.", "It all just pans out like a long episode of \"Power Rangers\" minus the costumes with so many predictable plot twists.", "An extremely stupid action movie.", "In their quest for the youth market, Hollywood hacks often dress up their old script ideas in baggy pants and backward baseball caps, but I hope American kids aren't dumb enough to swallow this awful extreme-sports adventure.", "The impossible plot and laugh-out-loud dialogue would have been tolerable if the tricks were impressive.", "No amount of skate tricks or avalanche-dodging ski stunts will win us over if the characters have had their charisma surgically removed.", "This is a duff plot, but as an excuse to show lots of people with guns, a lot more people jumping around on snowboards and even more people repeatedly shouting 'Woooo!', it's unbeatable.", "If you're walking past a cinema where it's showing, and it's raining, and you fancy a laugh...
