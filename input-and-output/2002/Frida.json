You may want to laugh now and then, but you won't look away.", "Salma Hayek finally ushered her dream project into production, but her impassioned lead performance lacks the necessary gravitas for the role, mistaking empty energy for wild fits of inspiration.", "The plodding, glumly literal screenplay holds this otherwise expressive biopic back, but it's still a colourful and entertaining watch.", "One can imagine Taymor's glorious vision as a triumph of which Frida herself would approve.", "a pity that the project paints by the numbers so much", "Sporting mustcahe, Selma Hayek gives a solid performance in the otherwise conventionl and mediocre biopic of the noted Spnish artist.", "Graphic biopic of artist Frida Kahlo.", "Taymor conveys in imaginative cinematic fashion how for Frida, creating art and living were one and the same.", "Actress Salma Hayek portrays the famed Mexican surrealist painter in a biopic that neither mythologizes nor decries the artist's accomplishments on or beyond the canvas.", "Taymor brings all of her artist's compassion to bear on a subject that deserves it.", "It wasn't a bad idea to conceive of the film as an epic, complex love story between Frida and Rivera, but the passion between them is more rhetorical than palpable...Taymor and Hayak give us only the rough sketch of a wild soul.", "Salma Hayek earned an Oscar nomination for her fierce, passionate portrayal of the famous, iconic Mexican painter.", "[A]s in soap opera, drama is synonymous with the torments of love. Hayek is a brave, tireless performer, ... but given the script she can only play Kahlo the \"beguiling personality\" she liked to think of herself as ... rather than Kahlo the artist.", "", "", "Frida boasts a small galaxy of charismatic stars orbiting two appealing actors in the juiciest roles of their careers.", "", "While this conventional bio-pic may please middle brow audiences, fans of Ms. Taymor are almost certain to realize that the film could have been so much more than this.", "While Hayek's portrayal is appealing and sincere, it's a shade too adoring.
