And, for better or worse, they do.", "This is a film that should probably go back where it came from.", "This wry, atmospheric procedural spawned by a real mystery would be thorny enough without also being an adaptation.", "A disappointingly conventional thriller from the Hughes brothers (Menace II Society still their best film by far), neither chilling enough as a horror flick nor compelling as a character study; one of Johnny Depp's few mediocre performances", "A rare, clever, horror film.", "Jack the Ripper has proven a far more durable movie baddie than Freddy, Jason and Hannibal combined.", "Fitfully arresting late night entertainment.", "This movie is beautiful to look at, but has little substance. All Depp and no depth.", "They want it to feel like one really bad dream ... and by the film's end we're too dizzy to think, to see if it all lines up.", "What the Hughes Brothers have done in making a lavish period piece complete ...... is nothing less than a revolutionary achievement.", "Some of the lines seem a bit over-the-top and the ending is improbable and schmaltzy, but it's a true Hollywood period film.
