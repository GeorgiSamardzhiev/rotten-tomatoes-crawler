{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Amsterdam Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a young Irish immigrant released from prison. He returns to the Five Points seeking revenge against his father's killer, William Cutting (Daniel Day-Lewis), a powerful anti-immigrant gang leader. He knows that revenge can only be attained by infiltrating Cutting's inner circle. Amsterdam's journey becomes a fight for personal survival and to find a place for the Irish people in 1860's New York.", "rating": "74", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h 48m", "director": "Martin Scorsese", "studio": "Miramax", "theater_date": "Dec 20, 2002", "dvd_date": "Mar 2, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The production design itself is exquisite in its own right.", "Martin Scorsese's Les Miserables.", "Gangs of New York is to Fernando Wood's Manhattan what Fellini's Satyricon is to Nero's Rome, with a touch of Monty Python filth on the faces and clothes.", "You simply have to applaud the magnitude and ambition of Scorsese's vision - it really is New York conceived of on a grand scale.", "One of the most provocative films from Hollywood in recent times.", "Gangs of New York is one of those haunting failures. I can't get over it; it still gives me a pang every time I think of it. It seemed so filled with potential.", "It's a punishing piece of work, this Gangs of New York. Spectacular, brilliant, but punishing-basically, one long brawl...", "The visuals are strong, while the central narrative is weak (a disastrous combination for a long movie). Worst of all, Gangs of New York achieves far too little while trying much too hard.", "Scorsese scores some fine political points along the way and demonstrates the mastery of his craft in every scene, but the underlying theme of brutal revenge at any cost loses its way too early on...", "Brilliant but devastating. High schoolers and up.", "One of Scorsese's weakest films, a wannabe historical epic that's essentially a formulaic revenge saga, lacking unified vision and style. The only reason to see it is Daniel Day-Lewis' vividly compelling performance as Bill the Butcher.", "[A] flawed masterpiece.", "The whole may not add up to the sum of its parts, but it's difficult to dismiss the brilliance of those parts.", "It's a story of such relevance to New York, to America and even to the rest of the world, that just had to be told on film with as much impact as a filmmaker can muster. And Martin Scorsese musters much.", "The impact is all in the broad strokes of Scorsese's design: the corresponding coming-of-age stories of three confused and violent adolescents: Amsterdam Vallon, New York City, and America. [Blu-Ray]", "Why did Scorsese spend three decades thirsting to make this movie? It's nowhere clear on the screen.", "Gangs becomes a standard revenge opus. And a long one at that.", "It's a story of violence, revenge, racial intolerance and class struggle, and it's a story told extremely well.", "Martin Scorseses dream project finally explodes on the screen after years of planning and another year of delays.", "It's never less than compelling, driven by an overwhelming, larger than life performance from Day-Lewis and by Scorsese's grandiose historical imagination."], "rating": ["", "2.5/4", "", "3/5", "3/4", "", "", "", "3.5/5", "4/5", "C", "", "3/4", "", "3.5/4", "2/5", "2.5/4", "4/5", "3.5/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Danielle Solzman", "Josh Larsen", "Joshua Brown", "PJ Nabarro", "Namrata Joshi", "Eileen Jones", "Amy Taubin", "Barbara Ellen", "James Wegg", "Nell Minow", "Emanuel Levy", "Philip French", "Michael Dequina", "Urban Cinefile Critics", "Peter Canavese", "Rob Gonsalves", "Joe Lozito", "Jason Zingale", "Jeffrey M.
