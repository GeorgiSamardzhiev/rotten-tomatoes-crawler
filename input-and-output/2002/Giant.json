It told about two generations of a wealthy American cattle ranching family in Texas spanning a twenty-five year period", "Including a fine performance from Elizabeth Taylor, great acting from Rock Hudson and a piercing portrayal from James Dean. Giant stands shoulder-to-shoulder with the great ones.", "Giant, in spite of its length, seldom seems long -- its story is too eventful, its effects too picturesque, and its director too skilful for that even over so long an expanse of time. It may not be a great film but it is certainly an awesome one.", "Sweeping saga of American prosperity that reveals its racist underbelly; glorious star vehicle that upends rigid gender roles; modern western that questions the validity of frontier land ownership.", "The combination of director George Stevens and source novelist Edna Ferber, both given to expressions of overblown high seriousness, yields a long, slow, achingly self-important movie.", "This ambitious adaptation of the Edna Ferber novel is often touched by greatness, yet it's ultimately too scattershot to satisfactorily maintain its bloated 200-minute running time.", "Like the title says.", "An excellent film which registers strongly on all levels, whether it's in its breathtaking panoramic shots of the dusty Texas plains; the personal, dramatic impact of the story itself, or the resounding message it has to impart.", "Its deeper themes and superb performances from Taylor, Hudson and Dean make it a classic Hollywood epic.", "Much of it is awful, but it's almost impossible not to be taken in by the narrative sprawl.", "Dean's last performance is poetry in motion.", "Stevens' sprawling epic of Texan life, taken from Edna Ferber's novel, strives so hard for Serious Statements that it ends up as a long yawn.", "Some critics consider Giant to too bloated and sprawling, but by its era's standards, it exposed idelogical cracks in the American Dream, the myth of melting pot, women's allotted place in society.", "", "", "For a reason I cannot fathom, Giant still has a reputation as a fine film, and it will no doubt go on boring audiences forever and a day."], "rating": ["", "1", "", "", "A+", "", "", "", "3/5", "3/4", "4/4", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "B+", "4/5", "5/5", "1/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Andrew Sarris", "Mike Massie", "Adam Nayman", "Clyde Gilmour", "Tim Dirks", "James Powers", "", "Serena Donadoni", "Philip Kemp", "Matt Brunson", "", "Fred Hift", "", "Dave Kehr", "Cole Smithey", "Geoff Andrew", "Emanuel Levy", "Forrest Hartman", "Michael Szymanski", "Dan Callahan"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Ringer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Maclean&#39;s Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmsite", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Village Voice", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reno Gazette-Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">International Press Academy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slant Magazine"], "date": ["February 3, 2021", "August 22, 2020", "March 27, 2020", "January 29, 2020", "September 29, 2019", "October 10, 2018", "March 21, 2018", "September 28, 2016", "April 14, 2014", "November 6, 2013", "November 13, 2007", "November 13, 2007", "November 13, 2007", "November 13, 2007", "May 11, 2007", "June 24, 2006", "December 13, 2005", "October 7, 2005", "September 21, 2005", "May 23, 2005"]}}
