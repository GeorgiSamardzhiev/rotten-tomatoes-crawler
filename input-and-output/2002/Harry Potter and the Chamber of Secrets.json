A technical and visual masterpiece.", "Good film directed for a teenage audience in which not only is magic taught but also how stereotypes affect it while the film itself recreates some British stereotypes. [Review in Spanish]", "This time, the adventures of the world's most famous young wizard come mixed with a stiff dose of the menacing.", "Director David Yates deals with this change of tone skillfully.", "Director Chris Columbus has pushed the envelope farther, made a sequel that is pacier and more swashbuckling. Yet it still feels cautious and reined-in.", "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is darker, funnier and finer than its forerunner Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.", "Chamber Of Secrets is funnier and more exciting than the first Harry Potter movie, and adorned with some of the most stunning special effects ever.", "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets isn't perfect, but it's everything it should be: fun, exciting, humorous and stirring.", "Have no fear, you legions of Potter fans: Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is a solid step forward in the movie adaptations of J.K. Rowling's much-read novels.", "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets is good enough to satisfy hard-core fans, even if it falls short of being truly transporting moviemaking.", "Columbus' pacing is still murderously slow, his ideas as pedestrian as the worst TV.", "Apart from a rather pointless cameo from Kenneth Branagh and a rather peaky-looking Richard Harris, in truth there was nothing in HP2 that we hadn't already seen in HP1.", "Despite its sophomoric awkwardness, the Chamber of Secrets is a welcome delivery of childlike wonder for a planet of ever- increasing ugliness.", "Although it's unlikely to make converts of the uninitiated, fans of the series and its characters will find the movie to be a worthy entry.", "It appears that the production has learned from its mistakes and managed to put together the kind of film that deserves to be a part of young adult film folklore for generations to come.", "This new Harry Potter has its flaws, but it's better, as well as darker, than the first.", "Two down, presumably five to go, and already the franchise is entering dangerous territory: if you aren't one of the many who know their Harry Potter chapter and verse, prepare for a nap."], "rating": ["", "5/10", "4.5/5", "", "3.5/5", "2/4", "", "", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Film Companion Staff", "Mike Massie", "Leigh Paatsch", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Guillem Martinez Oya", "Namrata Joshi", "Megan Basham", "Sukhdev Sandhu", "Lizzie Rusbridger", "Christopher Tookey", "Brian Linder", "Matt Soergel", "Dennis King", "Sam Adams", "Philip Kerr", "Gregory Weinkauf", "Michael Kleinschrodt", "KJB", "Joe Morgenstern", "Michael Agger"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Companion", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinematismo", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Outlook", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WORLD", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Mail (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IGN Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Florida Times-Union", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia City Paper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Statesman", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times-Picayune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IGN Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker"], "date": ["October 27, 2020", "September 29, 2020", "June 18, 2020", "November 13, 2019", "July 11, 2019", "January 4, 2019", "October 3, 2018", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "November 26, 2013", "November 26, 2013"]}}
