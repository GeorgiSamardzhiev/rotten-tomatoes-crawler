It plods along like a chronic asthmatic, meandering to a conclusion that's both irritating and implausible.", "...Suitably gritty and intense...", "It's hard to know whether or not to recommend this film because for every thing it does right there's at least one and occasionally two things it gets ever so wrong.", "Engaging thriller combines military movie genres and succeeds as more than the sum of its well-oiled parts.", "Reaches for more than it can handle, but it's well-acted and earnest in its intentions.", "", "Paint-by-numbers claptrap.", "As old-fashioned as it can get, a throwback to cinema's Golden Age and a tribute to the flawed, guilty human beings we call heroes.", "As an American propagandistic attempt to market patriotism (or courage, or honor), it is arguably successful; by its own merits it is merely decent.", "", "The movie's surplus of male-fraternizing never conveys that these Americans are under imminent danger and stress.", "Hart's War is an absorbing courtroom drama that gives Farrell the chance to show off his star quality although the ending disappoints."], "rating": ["", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "B", "", "", "2.5/5", "2/5", "4/5", "2.5/5", "3/5", "", "3/5", "", "3.5/4", "", "2.5/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Ansen", "Nell Minow", "Mark Halverson", "", "Emanuel Levy", "Jeffrey M.
