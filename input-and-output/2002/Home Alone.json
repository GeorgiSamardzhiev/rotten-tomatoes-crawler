{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When bratty 8-year-old Kevin McCallister (Macaulay Culkin) acts out the night before a family trip to Paris, his mother (Catherine O'Hara) makes him sleep in the attic. After the McCallisters mistakenly leave for the airport without Kevin, he awakens to an empty house and assumes his wish to have no family has come true. But his excitement sours when he realizes that two con men (Joe Pesci, Daniel Stern) plan to rob the McCallister residence, and that he alone must protect the family home.", "rating": "67", "genre": "Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Chris Columbus", "studio": "20thCenturyFox,HughesEntertainment", "theater_date": "Nov 16, 1990", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$281.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A not completely unnuanced riff on the themes of family, safety and sanctity.", "The degree to which Home Alone's various components work, and work exceedingly well, is generally nothing short of astonishing...", "Expert conceptual construction from celebrated writer-director John Hughes (The Breakfast Club, Trains, Planes & Automobiles) elevates a low-flying caper comedy to great heights.", "A lot of people love Home Alone around the holidays but I love Home Alone year round.", "Home Alone has a premise that over the years became classic and an execution that was endearing from the beginning.

But even then, the script is tremendously weak, by Hughes's standards or anybody else's.", "The only really likable thing about this film is Culkin. He's an uncommonly natural child actor, but even he doesn't always survive the tiresome gags (the aftershave bit is funny once; three times is tedious).", "This is engaging and frequently hilarious.
