{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A deranged teen kills several fellow students, leaving \"it girl\" Deanna Cartwright (Erika Christensen) alive but badly wounded. Police Detective Martin Van Zandt (Victor Garber) suspects that student Alicia Browning (Busy Philipps), a misunderstood outsider who wasn't hurt, had a role in the murders. The police start monitoring her activities, and, at the behest of police and school officials, Alicia visits Deanna at the hospital.
