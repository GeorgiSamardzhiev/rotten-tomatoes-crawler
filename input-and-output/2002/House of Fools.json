This makes for a bizarre movie, but it has some really tender moments.", "War is insane. Insane people are cute. Bryan Adams is God. There, now that you've got these three principles down, you don't need to see House of Fools.", "Sub-Fellini nonsense.", "The use of Bryan Adams as the madwoman's imagined paramour is indicative of just how mediocre this movie is.", "Too disjointed, derivative and stylistically clumsy to be much more than an irritant.", "", "There's not much to Konchalovsky's tale ... but it's often beautifully told; a gentle fantasy of a harsh time.", "As Janna demonstrates, old assumptions and passions certainly die hard. And the worst is when they don't die at all.", "Often trying and not wholly successful but highly ambitious and ultimately rewarding.", "...the most striking feature of the film is the fundamental decency and even gentleness of both the soldiers and the mad", "Based-on-a-true-tale drama about an insane asylum on the frontlines in the Chechen conflict is tired, trite and dull."], "rating": ["3/5", "C-", "3/5", "3/5", "2/4", "2.5/4", "4/4", "C-", "1/4", "2.5/5", "2/5", "", "2/5", "C-", "3/5", "2.5/4", "3/4", "B-", "B", "1/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Emanuel Levy", "Dennis Schwartz", "Steve Schneider", "Jay Boyar", "Marta Barber", "Laura Kelly", "", "Chris Vognar", "Jeff Vice", "Cherryl Dawson and Leigh Ann Palone", "Kim Linekin", "David Elliott", "Marjorie Baumgarten", "Frank Swietek", "Oz", "Moira MacDonald", "Phil Villarreal", "William Arnold", "Philip Martin", "James Rocchi"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Miami Herald", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dallas Morning News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Deseret News (Salt Lake City)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieChicks.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eye WEEKLY", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Diego Union-Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Austin Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Guy&#39;s Opinion", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arizona Daily Star", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Post-Intelligencer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Netflix"], "date": ["September 11, 2005", "October 28, 2003", "August 29, 2003", "August 29, 2003", "August 22, 2003", "August 21, 2003", "July 16, 2003", "July 11, 2003", "July 11, 2003", "July 11, 2003", "July 8, 2003", "June 28, 2003", "June 15, 2003", "June 14, 2003", "June 14, 2003", "June 13, 2003", "June 12, 2003", "June 12, 2003", "June 4, 2003", "May 22, 2003"]}}
