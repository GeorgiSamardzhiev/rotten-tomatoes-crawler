{"metadata": {"synopsis": "There is something dark and mysterious occurring in a small Hungarian village, but exactly what that is remains a secret, barely perceptible among the rhythms of everyday life. A youth drives the milk cart and spies a young woman sunbathing. An old woman plows her field, and a farmer's sow is fertilized. But there is also a strange ritual that involves the villagers and the mailman, who presents items to every new widow when her husband dies -- something that happens with regular frequency.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 17m", "director": "Gyorgy Palfi", "studio": "Columbia", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2005", "box_office": "$48.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Told almost entirely without words and composed largely of detail shots, this doesn't quite transcend the gimmickry of its concept, but it succeeds as a bravura technical exercise with some truly amazing images.", "Some of the things encountered in Hukkle are brilliant cinematic conceits, which the director properly builds up to their punchline.", "", "Sparkling and thought-provoking, Hukkle is the cinematic equivalent of a puzzle box wrapped up in ethnic enigmas and rural riddles.", "It's a novelty, and an educational one at that. It reminds you of just how dumb your average movie is these days.", "The movie is an enriching, lovingly filmed exercise in disorientation, worth seeing more than once if you've got the time, money and patience.", "Unclassifiable and wildly original.", "So precisely and hypnotically assembled it could have been directed by a particularly whimsical metronome.", "Gyorgy Palfi shows an incredibly deft hand in creating a fictional story that...you could enjoy as a slice of life in rural Hungary", "There are so many odd references tucked into \"Hukkle\" it becomes a complex puzzle masquerading as a simple tale which may require multiple viewings.", "What film is all about, but all too often isn't -- it challenges its audience to look at the world in a different way.", "Packs more bizarre ideas into its 75 minutes than most films do with two hours.", "", "Daring and unusual.", "At once impressive and indulgent, hypnotic and patience-inducing with its languorous rhythms.", "Kind of like Koyaanisqatsi without an agenda.", "The picture is so completely detailed and precise in its depiction of pastoral beauty that, if you blink, you might well minimize--or miss--the murder that gradually darkens the story.", "Hypnotic, elliptical, often rapturously beautiful, the film is a testament to the much-maligned concept of art cinema, one that depends for its thrills on film's essentials as a visual and sonic medium.", "You're in for an unforgettable experience, a microcosmic cornucopia of delights.", "It's bracingly funny to see the glorious human species redefined as just another set of moving parts in a huge machine lacking any evident purpose."], "rating": ["", "", "4/5", "A", "3/5", "3.5/5", "3/4", "3/4", "B-", "B", "4/4", "3.5/4", "4/4", "7/10", "", "3/4", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Martin Rubin", "Boyd van Hoeij", "", "Bill Gibron", "Roger Moore", "Steve Schneider", "Liam Lacey", "Wesley Morris", "Robin Clifford", "Laura Clifford", "G.
