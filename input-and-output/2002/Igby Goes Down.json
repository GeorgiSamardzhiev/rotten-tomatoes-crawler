{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Igby Slocumb (Kieran Culkin), a rebellious and sarcastic 17-year-old boy, is at war with the stifling world of old money privilege he was born into. With a schizophrenic father (Bill Pullman), a self-absorbed, distant mother (Susan Sarandon), and a shark-like young Republican big brother (Ryan Phillippe), Igby figures there must be a better life out there -- and sets about finding it.", "rating": "76", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Burr Steers", "studio": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer,UnitedArtists", "theater_date": "Sep 13, 2002", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$4.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["If this were a short story, it would belong in The New Yorker in the days of J.D. Salinger. It is both droll and grim, often handsome and tasteful with its cinematography and production values.", "so many of the characters are so soulless, making it difficult to see past their sarcastic, brash exteriors... So when all the iciness melts away, the sentimentality which replaces it seems unconvincingly pat.", "Dark, depressing story that's for adults only.", "Steers puts a lot of balls in the air, but no one, including Igby, gets developed far enough for viewers to really know and care about them.", "Consistently unusual, unpredictable and uproarious viewing.", "Balancing its frequently absurd humour with poignant observations of that time in life when you're not sure exactly what it is you're rebelling against, Igby Goes Down is an offbeat winner.", "", "Yes, it's The Catcher in the Rye all over again - with generous helpings of Rushmore, The Graduate, Bret Easton Ellis and The Ice Storm. Igby never reaches those heights ...", "", "", "Deep, dark and hopelessly cynical - the kind of film that kids are too young for and won't understand and parents are too old for and won't understand either.", "While teens are at the age of self discovery, Igby is doing his best work at self-destruction.", "While J.D. Salinger and his Holden Caulfield positively own the territory of runaway upper class malcontents in New York, this funny and touching film does justice to the genre.", "The poignancy of the conclusion leaves you hoping fervently that Igby's best is still to come - and Culkin's, as well.", "", "The nearest thing we've got to a big-screen Catcher in the Rye...with Kieran Culkin giving a very Holden Caufield-esque performance.", "", "", "An uninspiring, would-be Catcher in the Rye story.", "It's second-class Salinger, but even at that it's thoughtfully entertaining."], "rating": ["", "", "4/5", "", "3/4", "", "3.5/4", "", "3.5/4", "7/10", "7", "1.5/4", "3.5/5", "", "4/5", "3.5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "C", "7/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Malcolm Johnson", "Anton Bitel", "Kelly Kessler", "Ken Eisner", "Michael Dequina", "Urban Cinefile Critics", "Joe Lozito", "Neil Young", "Scott Nash", "Tony Medley", "Rob Macdonald", "Ross Anthony", "Marcy Dermansky", "Sandra Hall", "Matthew Turner", "Shannon J.
