Events in his second movie, Marooned in Iraq, are even more heart-rending.", "Even though the film's tone grows ever more elegiac, it stubbornly remains a celebration of the Kurdish capacity to endure.", "Moving from the harsh reportage of his first feature, A Time for Drunken Horses, Kurdish filmmaker Bahman Ghobadi looks at life through the all-seeing but forgiving lens of comedy.", "Ghobadi has found a way to use the quest of one man to show all the problems in Kurdistan. It's interesting, occasionally funny and thought-provoking, but doesn't quite capture your heart.", "Eliciting affecting performances from his cast of nonprofessionals (all with fascinating faces), Ghobadi manages to balance the inhumanity with humanity.", "Though Marooned in Iraq falls short of greatness, its timing couldn't be more brilliant.", "Here is an immensely touching and compassionate film about the harassed and persecuted Kurdish people fleeing from Iraq towards the Iranian border; it will open your eyes and your heart as well.", "Part rollicking road picture, part ardent homage to ethnic homeland, and part unexpected last laugh for Iran-based Kurdish director Bahman Ghobadi.", "Both celebratory and elegiac.", "On a miniscule budget, Ghobadi conveys the terror of war, while the beautifully edited sequence in which Iranian villagers make bricks resembles nothing so much as a choreographed dance number."], "rating": ["3/5", "1.5/4", "B", "3/4", "4/5", "4/4", "3.5/4", "3/4", "4/4", "", "4/4", "3.5/5", "", "3/5", "B+", "", "", "A-", "", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Emanuel Levy", "Paul Sherman", "John A.
