But even the worst parts are saved by an air of innocent enjoyment.", "I think it's arguable one of the best family films ever made.", "Mary Poppins is a picture that is, more than most, a triumph of many individual contributions. And its special triumph is that it seems to be the work of a single, cohesive intelligence.", "As the magical nanny who turns life upside down for her charges in Edwardian England, Julie Andrews maintains a stiff upper lip that dries out some of the Disney schmaltz.", "This is easily the best of Disney's experiments in combining animation and live action, and one of the studio's best-loved films.", "Van Dyke and Andrews have great chemistry together, but it's really her interaction with the children and the magic of the story and the visual effects that charm audiences.", "Van Dyke's energy is prodigious (especially when he leaps around with a gang of sooty chimney-sweeps on the London rooftops) and the songs are classics.", "One of the great movie musicals and of that rare breed of deathless family entertainment that's guaranteed to transfix children, well beyond this, its fiftieth anniversary. [Blu-ray]", "Whether the movie's message is Travers-approved or not, the emphasis on joy and empathy proves heartening, even today.", "The entire set was constructed indoors and it shows: the \"outdoor\" scenes are bathed in a dull gray light", "World's coolest nanny celebrates family and fun.", "One of the best films ever produced by Disney, indeed one of the best American films of the 1960s... a fantasy of the most delicate touch and charming disposition.", "The sets are luxuriant, the songs lilting, the scenario witty but impeccably sentimental, and the supporting cast only a pinfeather short of perfection.", "With all the subtlety of Battleship Potemkin, a queue full of sour-faced old school nannies is shown blowing away into thin air to make way for the embodiment of modern female assertiveness.", "Arguably, it already seemed dated by the early 1970s, within a decade of its 1964 release. Yet still, somehow, the substantial charms of Mary Poppins live on.", "The film was deservedly a mega-hit.", "The grace of the effects makes it some kind of classic.", "One of the greatest children's films ever."], "rating": ["", "8/10", "", "A+", "", "", "5/5", "A-", "4/5", "4/4", "4.5/5", "7", "5/5", "1", "", "3/4", "8", "", "", "4/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Al Cohn", "Mike Massie", "Wendy Michener", "Rachel Wagner", "James Powers", "Jake Wilson", "David Parkinson", "James Plath", "Martin Chilton", "Peter Canavese", "Noel Murray", "Dan Jardine", "Common Sense Media Editors", "Tim Brayton", "", "Eric Henderson", "Brian Webster", "", "Dave Kehr", ""], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Maclean&#39;s Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rachel&#39;s Reviews (YouTube)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Age (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Family Home Theater", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Groucho Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dissolve", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily-Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slant Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Apollo Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide"], "date": ["February 3, 2021", "August 27, 2020", "July 16, 2019", "May 9, 2019", "December 17, 2018", "November 9, 2018", "April 6, 2016", "March 30, 2016", "January 1, 2015", "December 9, 2013", "December 9, 2013", "September 16, 2013", "January 1, 2011", "November 29, 2010", "April 24, 2009", "January 27, 2009", "January 23, 2009", "March 3, 2008", "March 3, 2008", "March 3, 2008"]}}
