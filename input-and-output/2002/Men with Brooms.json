{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A decade ago, curler Chris Cutter (Paul Gross) disappeared suddenly on the verge of stardom, dropping his curling stones to the bottom of a lake and leaving his fianc\u00e9e, Julie Foley (Michelle Nolden), at the altar. But when his former coach dies, Cutter returns home for the funeral and attempts to fulfill the man's last wishes. The team is reunited under Cutter's estranged dad, Gordon (Leslie Nielsen) -- himself a former curling star -- for a final attempt at glory.", "rating": "57", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Paul Gross", "studio": "SerendipityPointFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 12, 2016", "box_office": "$4.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The filmmakers have great fun mixing and matching the game's metaphors. With such gags as a sweat lodge of hot curling rocks, they send up and glorify its rituals all at once.", "Think The Full Monty on ice: Canada's most famous TV Mountie Paul Gross (Due South) puts tongue firmly in cheek as he applies the old underdog sports team formula to that great Northern obsession: curling.", "On one hand, it's a Canadian movie about curling, so points for originality and cultural pride... On the other hand, almost all of those points for originality come back off, because... we can see it all coming from the opening scenes. I mean, everything.", "Serving as director, writer and lead, Paul Gross -- who enjoyed brief fame in the TV Mountie show Due South -- imbues his film with that series' same languid Canadian charm.", "While curling enthusiasts may be delighted to see their little-known sport featured in a film, actor-director Paul Gross never manages to make it seem interesting to newcomers.", "", "The plot of the comeback curlers isn't very interesting actually, but what I like about Men With Brooms and what is kind of special is how the film knows what's unique and quirky about Canadians.", "Not completely loveable -- but what underdog movie since The Bad News Bears has been? -- but certainly hard to hate.", "Call this The Full Monty on ice, the underdog sports team formula redux.", "Scores a few points for doing what it does with a dedicated and good-hearted professionalism.", "It makes you believe the cast and crew thoroughly enjoyed themselves and believed in their small-budget film.", "This is a winning ensemble comedy that shows Canadians can put gentle laughs and equally gentle sentiments on the button, just as easily as their counterparts anywhere else in the world.", "", "", "Curling may be a unique sport but Men with Brooms is distinctly ordinary.", "Someday, a creative filmmaker may make an involving movie on the unique sport of curling. Men With Brooms, however, is not that movie.", "This isn't exactly profound cinema, but it's good-natured and sometimes quite funny.", "While much of the cast has charm -- especially Allodi and Nolden -- the performers are sunk by the film's primitive approach to the mechanics of comedy.", "", "A perplexing example of promise unfulfilled, despite many charming moments."], "rating": ["", "", "", "3/5", "1.5/5", "2/5", "3/5", "3/5", "B-", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "3/5", "B", "2/5", "2/5", "", "7", "2/5", "2.5/4", "2.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Brian D.
