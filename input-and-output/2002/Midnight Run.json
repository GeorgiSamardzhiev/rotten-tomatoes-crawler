{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When Eddie Moscone (Joe Pantoliano) hires tight-lipped bounty hunter Jack Walsh (Robert De Niro) to locate a mob accountant named \"The Duke\" (Charles Grodin) and bring him to L.A., Eddie tells Jack that the job will be simple, or a \"midnight run.\" But when Jack finds The Duke, the FBI and the mob are anxious to get their hands on him. In a cross-country chase, Jack must evade the authorities, hide from the mob and prevent The Duke's erratic personality from driving him mad.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy", "runtime": "2h 2m", "director": "Martin Brest", "studio": "UniversalPictures,CityLightFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 18, 2015", "box_office": "$36.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There's a certain blue-collar demographic pocket in America where \"Midnight Run\" will live on forever. I still hear manly guys quoting it 30 years later. You wanna die laughing? Here's your chance.", "The comic chemistry between Grodin and De Niro is of a rare, and relentlessly funny calibre.", "...as funny as it is exciting.", "This could have been engaging fluff except De Niro's acting has grown as heavy as Jake La Motta.", "Midnight Run is a witty, low-key comedy with the accent on character. Individually, De Niro and Grodin are brilliant; together, they are hilarious.", "What makes Midnight Run so remarkable are its principals, and the supporting cast that keep the audience titillated, laughing and excited for the film's entire 128 minute-running time.", "An extremely satisfying action-comedy, one that STILL hasn't fully received its due.", "The interplay between the two leads is pure gold.", "Who said movies always have to be original? This one is redeemed by execution and brilliant talent: De Niro, Grodin, director Martin Brest, composer Danny Elfman, most of the cast and technicians.", "A thoroughly engaging action film, Midnight Run boasts a superb cast that transforms its rather mundane story line into something memorable, funny, and moving.", "Wonder why De Niro doesn't do comedy this good any more.", "A performance like De Niro's, in a well-made entertainment like Midnight Run, is cheap at any price. And capable of restoring the audience's faith in the form.", "Midnight Run is an inside-out, upside-down buddy film and comedic cross- country caper. It also is the entertaining excuse for Robert De Niro, the Method actor of his generation, to cut loose and play things light for a change.", "As with all the best road movies -- and this is one of the best -- the picture really moves, as a simple air trip from New York to LA turns into a saga of trains and automobiles, car crashes, and skirmishes with the FBI and [other] interested parties.", "De Niro is nervily hilarious and Grodin nervelessly exceptional in Midnight Run, a formula buddy movie exalted to insta-classic status by their performances.", "De Niro is probably the most intense and idiosyncratic actor of his generation; Midnight Run may be the most conventional movie I've ever seen.", "Brace yourself for a movie joyride that sends you home reeling from thrills, laughter and the pleasure of honest sentiment.", "Grodin and De Niro are different kinds of actors, but they share a knack for detail and a gift for understatement that keeps their scenes together crackling.", "A cut above your average buddy flick.", "The pleasures of Midnight Run come mainly from its acting."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "5/5", "", "3.5/5", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "3/4", "", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mark Jackson", "Leigh Paatsch", "David Nusair", "Molly Haskell", "Brian D.
