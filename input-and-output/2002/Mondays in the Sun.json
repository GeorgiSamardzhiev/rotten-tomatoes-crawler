{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Vigo, a port town in Spain, has fallen on hard times. The shipbuilding industry, which was a primary source of jobs, has laid off many workers. Several of these erstwhile shipbuilders spend their newfound free time at a local bar owned by their friend Rico (Joaqu\u00edn Climent). The group is headed by Santa (Javier Bardem), a steadfast pragmatist who tries to keep the spirits of the men high. Troubles are many, however, including the marital problems of Amador (Celso Bugallo) and Jos\u00e9 (Luis Tosar).", "rating": "80", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Fernando Le\u00f3n de Aranoa", "studio": "Televisi\u00f3ndeGalicia(TVG)S.A.,InstitutodelaCinematograf\u00edaydelasArtesAudiovisuales,Mediapro,V\u00edaDigital,Eurimages,El\u00edasQuerejetaProduccionesCinematogr\u00e1ficasS.L.,Antena3Televisi\u00f3n,Sogepaq,QuoVadisCin\u00e9ma,ContinentalProducciones,EyescreenS.r.l.", "theater_date": "Jul 25, 2003", "dvd_date": "Jan 6, 2017", "box_office": "$146.4K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Delicado drama que, com seu elenco coeso encabeado por um Bardem vigoroso e intenso, funciona como um testemunho do impacto psicolgico e moral provocado pelo desemprego numa economia em recesso.", "", "Moving, often hilarious examination of masculine frustration with a sharply observed script and impressive performances from its cast.", "Another staggeringly strong performance by Javier Bardem.", "", "Bottom feeder, out of work adventurers busying themselves with basically anything that will keep the terror of an abyss called the future at bay.", "Full of sympathy for the worker's plight.", "Si Los Lunes al Sol es una pelcula tan humana, tan sensible y tan reveladora es porque hemos visto esos personajes ac noms, a la vuelta de la esquina.", "Okay, I'm saying it: Javier Bardem is the next Robert De Niro.", "Will look and feel all too familiar to victims of the jobless recovery, or at least those who can afford to see the movie.", "", "Thanks to Bardem's performance the film finds plenty of sublime moments.", "Seems born not of contrivance but genuine, hurtful truth", "A timely little slice of desolation.", "In these days of cutbacks and belt-tightening, its story has a strong resonance.", "If nothing else, watch it for Javier Bardem, who is rapidly establishing himself as among the world's very best at his craft", "Instead of pacing, it offers terrific performances and a wonderful sense of small-time tragedy", "What keeps us involved in this perceptive film is the beautiful acting of its cast ... and the way the movie balances grim reality with bits of fancy that feel oddly perfect.", "A small, intimate film that moves viewers with its passion.", "It has nice little touches, and some solid performances, but in the end nothing is accomplished.
