{"metadata": {"synopsis": "\"Monster's Ball\" is a hard-hitting Southern drama tempered by a story of powerful, life-changing love.

But, heavy-handed and derivative as it is, its lead actors strike some resonant chords....", "", "", "Forster's poised direction, as well as powerful turns from Billy Bob Thornton and the Oscar-winning Halle Berry, make this compelling viewing.", "Thornton and Berry show us what acting is in this movie.", "Halle Berry turns in an amazing performance.", "", "Recalls Tender Mercies, another astutely acted character study that remained resolutely small-scale and was all the more affecting because it didn't overreach.", "It's not a polemic on the death penalty, race relations or family dynamics. It's a character study that really sticks with you.", "", "Much of the film works, performances all around are better than the script, and the whole (especially the first part) is well directed by Marc Forster.", "A fine film that packs enormous ambition into a modest, carefully executed package.", "In a movie season already nourished with tales of domestic despair, Monster's Ball is the most complex, naturalistic, and sympathetic."], "rating": ["3/5", "3/5", "2/4", "3/5", "4/4", "B", "3.5/5", "B", "3.5/5", "1.5/4", "4/5", "4.5/5", "3/4", "A", "", "3.5/4", "4/5", "", "3/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Karl Quinn", "Nell Minow", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Mark Halverson", "Joe Lozito", "Emanuel Levy", "", "Jeffrey Overstreet", "", "Susan Tavernetti", "Caroline Westbrook", "John R.
