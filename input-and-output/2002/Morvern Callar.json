{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When her boyfriend commits suicide, unambitious Glasgow clerk Morvern Callar (Samantha Morton) invents various stories to explain his absence. After several days, she chops up and buries the body. She then finds a novel he completed before killing himself and sends it to several publishing houses as her own work. When the book is bought, Morvern uses her first payment to take a Spanish vacation with her best friend, Lana (Kathleen McDermott), which turns out to be a surprising emotional journey.", "rating": "84", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Lynne Ramsay", "studio": "BBCFilms,FilmCouncil", "theater_date": "Dec 20, 2002", "dvd_date": "Aug 22, 2017", "box_office": "$267.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Ultimately provides little resolution for our tough heroine, and the way the film visualizes this discontent continues to haunt at least one viewer.", "Morvern Callar isn't just cool, it's downright arctic: Ramsay takes her alienation neat with rarely a chaser of glam.", "The narration submits to the sensitised state that Morvern retreats into as she embarks on what could loosely be described as a personal epiphany: reinventing herself abroad.", "\"Morvern Callar\" is beautiful, crushing, and nihilistic as hell. Samantha Morton + Lynne Ramsay = heaven and I want them to work on another project together.", "Ramsay and Morton trust the audience enough to resist softening up or even explaining their central character, resulting in a difficult yet ultimately rewarding piece.", "While [Lynne] Ramsay's sensibility is entirely her own, it approaches the rawness of work by Nan Goldin or Richard Billingham.", "", "", "Samantha Morton's performance recalls Emily Watson's work in Breaking the Waves -- you can't take your eyes off of her.", "Morvern Callar is assured and confidently-made, even as the emotions of the title character seem brittle and crystalline.", "El resultado ha encontrado admiradores y detractores; sin llegar a ninguno de los dos extremos, yo tengo la impresi\u00f3n de que vi una buena pel\u00edcula pero no me di cuenta.", "\"Shocking and exhilarating.\"", "Morton finds a wealth of nuance in anomie and neurasthenia.", "A mesmerizing conundrum of a suspended life in perpetual motion.", "Ramsay is showing us one very particular type of person, a live-for-the-moment young woman who is fascinated by ugliness and pain and who -- like the poet, Terence -- believes nothing human is alien to her.", "A character study of such acuity that you'll find yourself thinking about it for days afterward.", "With little dialogue to assist her -- just the strains of that wonderfully organic music -- [Morton] still manages to suggest the internal struggle, and to slowly reveal a fierce toughness that flies in the face of conventional morality.", "Maintains your sympathy for this otherwise challenging soul by letting you share her one-room world for a while.", "You'll wonder how Morvern got that way.
