{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Years after his mother's death, artist Ernesto (Sergio Castellitto) learns of his family's initiative to get her canonized when he's invited for an interview with a cardinal (Maurizio Donadoni). The impending appointment stirs up complex feelings toward religion -- his mentally ill brother killed their mother because of her extreme pious ways. Slowly, he uncovers his family's self-serving motivations for beatification, while his son, Leonardo (Alberto Mondini), explores Roman Catholicism.", "rating": "84", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Marco Bellocchio", "studio": "FilmalbatrosS.r.l.", "theater_date": "Feb 11, 2005", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$40.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Bellocchio famously took on the Catholic Church and the Italian family in his frenetic first film ...
