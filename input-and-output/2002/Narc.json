Unfortunately the script is your basic renegade-cop narrative, with the usual hoo-ha about justice versus the law.", "Carnahan shows flair and confidence.", "", "If Carnahan keeps wrenching this material back an inch or two from clich, it's only an inch or two.", "Joe Carnahan's Narc is familiar stuff, but it is bracingly effective. There hasn't been a cop and robbers film this cold and harsh since the 1970's.", "For a picture that's billed as fresh and bracing, this is a pretty formulaic scheme, which Carnahan attempts to jolt into life through jittery direction.", "Narc est un film extrmement conventionnel dans son histoire, mais brille dans sa ralisation, son atmosphre et son style.", "Sometimes it seems a director tries to pack in as much harsh footage as an R-rating will allow for its own sake.
