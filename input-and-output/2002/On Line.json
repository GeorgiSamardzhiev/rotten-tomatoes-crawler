{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Set in Manhattan's cybersex industry, \"On-Line\" at first appears to be about people getting off without ever touching, but it's much more. Built around revealing and often funny videos with \"net-izens\" like man-on-man host AI Fleming (John Fleck), Internet fantasy girl Jordan Nash (Vanessa Ferlito), self-destructive artist Moira Ingalls (Isabel Gillies), and Ohio innocent Ed Simone (Eric Millegan), \"On-Line\" uses a mix of new technology and romantic narrative to tell a classic story.", "rating": "38", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 24m", "director": "Jed Weintrob", "studio": "", "theater_date": "May 22, 2003", "dvd_date": "Apr 5, 2017", "box_office": "$166.0K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "", "A [reasonably] compelling, refreshingly non-judgmental look at the newest phase of one-handed clapping.", "Although far-fetched at times, On Line gives us likable enough characters and several laugh out loud moments. Director Jed Weintrob has a distinct visual flair.", "", "With a fearlessness for being honest, the situations the characters find themselves in are embarrassing and laugh-out-loud funny.", "Amateurish drivel, which is headed for Skinemax in a hurry.", "The youthful cast is lively enough to make the enterprise almost work, presenting a time capsule of cyber- communication that should be more interesting 20 years from now.", "", "A 90-minute hairy-palm horror show, one that will strike terror into the heart of anyone who shares a keyboard with a lonely, Web-crazed roommate.", "Weintrob's stylish visuals mimic Web technologies, which succeed in making his characters seem all the more removed from reality. Now if someone would find a way to equip theater seats with a 'delete' key, we could be rid of them completely.", "There's something so familiar and commonplace about this story and its characters -- and maybe that has something to do with how much the Internet is a part of our everyday lives -- it's hard to get particularly thrilled.", "It does a good job of portraying the day-to-day life of these online obsessives, but we realize eventually that they are more interesting because they are online.", "If you like scenes of characters sticking hands down their pants, this is the film for you.", "A pleasant, small comedy that will have you smiling.", "On_Line is the kind of thing I dread -- a movie about digital technology directed by an expert in interactive media and video games.", "Doomed by Weintrob's passion for the Web, his passionless characters are little more than manipulated 'bots' -- and audiences, absenting possible hipster appeal, may vote more zeroes than ones for this digital tale.", "At its heart, On_Line is just an old-fashioned movie about people, relationships and making connections in an isolated world. And in this sense, the movie is very successful.", "Well-crafted late-night sleaze.", "Take away the computers and DSL lines and it's the 1950s of Jules Feiffer and Mike Nichols and Elaine May all over again, without the shrewdness and bite."], "rating": ["3/5", "1.5/4", "", "3.5/5", "0/4", "", "1/5", "2/4", "2.5/4", "", "2/4", "", "2/4", "2/4", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["", "Paul Sherman", "Andrew Wright", "Brian Mckay", "James Berardinelli", "Ryan Cracknell", "Bill Muller", "John Monaghan", "", "Gary Thompson", "Janice Page", "Desson Thomson", "Roger Ebert", "Robert K.
