{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Casual shoppers stocking up at the local SavMart may not pay much attention to the man at the photo counter. In fact, they may not even see him.

[Full review in Spanish].", "While honoring the suspense-building engine of a thriller, One Hour Photo creates a nightmare portrait of American life.", "Robin Williams makes this movie what it is with his uncomfortably fearless portrayal of the wimpish Sy the Photo Guy, giving us the creepiest, most spine tingling, heebie-jeebie making film of the year.", "One Hour Photo is a very well-made thriller. It shows us Robin Williams extending his acting range into unusual and disturbing material. And as well as causing acute anxiety in its last reels, it delivers a more moral message than most of its kind.", "A film that over the years I've come to appreciate far more than my initial viewing due to the brilliant, unforgettable effort by Robin Williams who gives one of his most haunting performances.", "Without Robin Williams, 'One Hour Photo' is just another predictable B movie thriller. He's like that slow train wreck, personified, that people can't seem to take their eyes off.", "Robin Williams gets a chance to stretch as an actor in this semi-effective thriller.", "Intensely scary thriller; not for every teen.", "this film shows that Williams can slither into the blacks and grays of the psyche", "", "Call it an exercise in threat management, free with the purchase of a photo album--or a movie ticket.", "This is a brilliant, incredibly directed film with excellent performances all around from Nielsen, and Williams who deserves an Oscar nod.", "This immaculately made first feature from noted musicvid and commercials director Mark Romanek provides Robin Williams with one of his creepiest, atypical roles, and the comic star responds with an unusually restrained performance...", "In a story so reliant on detail as the engine for character action, it's frustrating and annoying to see the film spiral down the gurgler because of a few (but crucial) lapses of attention to detail.", "Robin Williams creates a character who earns our revulsion--and somehow also our sympathy.", "Sy is a complete character with a physicality, inner monologue and motivation that we haven't seen from Mr. Williams in a long time. And it's a pleasure to watch.", "It has arresting things to say about how the family photo is used less to record than to project, and how far that projection can be from the truth.", "This story begs for a harder focus, the kind of thing Stanley Kubrick was always good at, at least until he got a little too focused. What saves the film is Robin Williams in a very atypical role.", "This is not the Robin Williams you are used to seeing."], "rating": ["4/5", "3/4", "", "", "", "7/10", "7/10", "C+", "3/5", "C+", "4/5", "", "3/4", "", "", "A-", "3/4", "", "3/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Leigh Paatsch", "Federico Furzan", "Felicia Feaster", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Alexander Walker", "Jeffrey Lyles", "James Plath", "Emanuel Levy", "Nell Minow", "John A.
