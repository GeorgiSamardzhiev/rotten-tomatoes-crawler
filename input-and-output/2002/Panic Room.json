{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Trapped in their New York brownstone's panic room, a hidden chamber built as a sanctuary in the event of break-ins, newly divorced Meg Altman (Jodie Foster) and her young daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart) play a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with three intruders - Burnham (Forest Whitaker), Raoul (Dwight Yoakam) and Junior (Jared Leto) - during a brutal home invasion. But the room itself is the focal point because what the intruders really want is inside it.", "rating": "76", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 52m", "director": "David Fincher", "studio": "Hofflund/Polone,ColumbiaPictures", "theater_date": "Mar 29, 2002", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$95.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Panic Room is among Fincher's most straightforward genre exercises, it's not really interested in subverting or challenging or upsetting anything...but that doesn't mean it doesn't have anything on its mind.", "Panic Room is one of those thrillers you'll enjoy and get really into on your first viewing, but probably won't be dying to watch again.", "Yet more top-shelf terror from director David Fincher, the man behind such popular pulse-pounders as Seven, The Game and Fight Club.", "Leaving you utterly dissatisfied...", "How did Fincher - a director who is very good at supplying thrills to thrillers, whatever his other strengths or limitations might be - end up shepherding such a leaden film?", "Extreme suspense, graphic violence; not for kids.", "Valuing logic over brutality, David Fincher's claustrophobic ride also touted the real-world practicality of keeping quiet over the cinematic kicks of a loud thriller. It's like \"Wait Until Dark\" with helplessness that's emotional, not just physical.", "Apart from one plot twist too many, \"Panic Room\" is a seamless suspense-thriller with a top-notch cast.", "There are so little things you can do with this story and a lot of it is pretty contrived.", "A thinking-man's women-in-jeopardy picture, Panic Room does about as much as humanly possible with its deliberately restricted one-setting premise.", "David Fincher directs a nail-biter starring Jodie Foster about a mother and daughter who defend their house against a brutal home invasion.", "[Allows] Fincher to shine as the skilled, stylish director that he is.", "After his mind-bending, exhilarating Fight Club, director David Fincher takes on a more conventional Hollywood thriller.", "Ultimately, this is just a big, dumb, commercial suspenser - but it's one of the best for ages, reminding us that it is still possible to make a high quality piece of popcorn entertainment.", "Fincher is such a technically brilliant director that he can elevate a genre film--a suspenser about a damsel-in-distress--above its melodramatic trappings. The confined space (whole movie is set within a house) is no big challenge for him.", "Never averse to glistening darkness, meaty metaphor or grandiloquent technical display, Fincher is also surprisingly at home with hokum.", "Panic Room is a very scary film, well made and lovingly dark, and it illustrates how terrified we are of becoming the victims we see on TV.", "The panic room itself is a provocative concept and it says something about modern society, but I'm not sure if it deserved its own movie.", "The rich in Panic Room are under siege, and the overgrown fortress of their self-indulgence seems helpless to defend itself.", ""], "rating": ["", "7/10", "4/5", "2/4", "6/10", "4/5", "3.5/4", "B+", "2/4", "", "", "3/4", "3/4", "4/5", "B", "", "4/5", "", "B+", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Chris Ludovici", "Marianna Neal", "Leigh Paatsch", "Namrata Joshi", "Tim Brayton", "Nell Minow", "Nick Rogers", "Cole Smithey", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Todd McCarthy", "Todd Gilchrist", "Joe Lozito", "Jeffrey M.
