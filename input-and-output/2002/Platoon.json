{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) leaves his university studies to enlist in combat duty in Vietnam in 1967. Once he's on the ground in the middle of battle, his idealism fades. Infighting in his unit between Staff Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger), who believes nearby villagers are harboring Viet Cong soldiers, and Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe), who has a more sympathetic view of the locals, ends up pitting the soldiers against each other as well as against the enemy.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "2h", "director": "Oliver Stone", "studio": "HemdaleFilmCorporation[us]", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 2, 2015", "box_office": "$138.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Oliver Stone's recreation of the infantry foot-soldier's Vietnam War is an accurate depiction of how little-or-no-choice-having, U.S. drafted soldiers comport themselves, as opposed to true-calling warriors like the elite Navy SEALS in \"Lone Survivor.'", "It's extremely violent and brutal, yet tragically realistic.", "Platoon (1986) is a harrowing, visceral, ultra-realistic, gutsy, visually-shattering Vietnam-war film, based on the writer/director's own first-hand knowledge as a Vietnam combat-infantry soldier. The insightful Best Picture-winning war film", "Oliver Stone based his movie on his own experiences and attempted to make a more \"realistic\" Vietnam movie, simpler and more grounded than things like Apocalypse Now and The Deer Hunter... and he succeeds, truly making this war look like hell.", "For a while Platoon amazes. Its authenticity and dark, dramatic tone promise a great deal... But the characters gradually disappear into formula and action into melodrama.", "Although Platoon is not the easiest film to watch, it is one of the best at reminding us that the cinema is not always interested in evading or distorting history. Sometimes it tells the truth.", "It's not a film that will make film history, but intelligently takes advantage of that history to provide a shred of light to a sordid and still American debate. [Full Review in Spanish]", "This film is an act of courage. Stone, the gutsy writer-director, records in a devastating barrage of images the relentless horror and the senseless carnage experienced by far too many Americans in Vietnam.", "Stone's strongest suit, however, isn't so much realism as it is his way of blending immediacy and insight.", "Platoon is not the definitive Vietnam statement that Stone may have intended, or that others are already claiming it to be. But it is a powerful document about that sad war, and a riveting piece of moviemaking.", "There are images in Platoon so powerful that they seem, rather than simply imprinted on celluloid, to have been burned into memory.", "The utter chaos of war in Vietnam is brilliantly portrayed. No one can deny this film the power of its images and the weight of all-pervasive terror it creates.", "Precisely because Stone forces you to experience a grunt's tunnel vision and rage, Platoon is a film of inspiring empathy and awesome force. Curiously, that same tunnelvision in the end compromises Platoon.", "This is a modern classic and a personal exorcism for its director.", "Oliver Stone tries ambitiously to capture the full horror and frenzy of combat in Southeast Asia, but his technical skill outstrips his insight.", "No sane person should want to get any closer to war than this film.", "One of the best Vietnam films out there. And this is coming from a person who thinks that modern-day filmmaker Oliver Stone is a big, fat windbag.", "This is movie-making with a zealot's fervor.", "Platoon is filled with one fine performance after another, and one can only wish that every person who saw the cartoonish war fantasy that was Rambo would buy a ticket to Platoon and bear witness to something closer to the truth.", "The grisly reality is brought to life by Stone's dialogue and emotion-charged combat scenes, raising thought-provoking questions of morality in this still-resonant classic."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "1", "A+", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "3/4", "5/5", "", "", "4.5/5", "4.5/5", "4/4", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mark Jackson", "Mike Massie", "Tim Dirks", "Jeffrey M.
