What a wonderful talent, and what a maddening, but enjoyable film.", "One of the most uneven motion pictures that I've had the displeasure of sitting through over the past few years.", "...a pretentious mess...", "Christina Ricci comedy about sympathy, hypocrisy and love is a misfire.", "By halfway through this picture I was beginning to hate it, and, of course, feeling guilty for it....
