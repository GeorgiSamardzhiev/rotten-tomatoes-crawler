His music wakes Akasha (Aaliyah), the queen of all vampires, and inspires her desire to make Lestat her king. Akasha's malevolent power is so great that all the immortal vampires must stand against her if they want to survive. Meanwhile, a young London woman with a fascination for the dark side (Marguerite Moreau) falls in love with Lestat.", "rating": "17", "genre": "Horror", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Michael Rymer", "studio": "WarnerBros.", "theater_date": "Feb 22, 2002", "dvd_date": "Jun 17, 2009", "box_office": "$30.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The result is a film that's as camp as Butlins but nowhere near as much fun and full of awful performances and silly dialogue", "It's mainly an excuse for director Michael Rymer to unleash his arsenal of flashy, MTV-type visuals and Moulin Rouge costume designer Angus Strathie to play dress-up.", "It's difficult to make a truly boring vampire picture, but the folks behind this draggy adaptation of Anne Rice's bestsellers The Vampire Lestat and The Queen of the Damned have done just that.", "Michael Rymer stages high-tech sequences combining gore, romance, and gothy music, and he has enough conviction to make what could have been very silly strangely provocative.", "Aaliyah is gorgeous, but that doesn't save the film's tedious pacing, and cheesy atmosphere in the end.", "It isn't great entertainment or camp, but pic sets its ambitions so low, it can't help partially delivering on them.", "Aaliyah makes a brief but memorable posthumous appearance about an hour into the nearly incoherent proceedings, which are riddled with unintentional guffaws.", "Whatever life there is to the movie is what [Aaliyah] brings to it.", "The film is vampire roadkill.", "Perhaps the sole reason to see this film is to pay final tribute to Aaliyah. Too bad it isn't a better movie.", "Wishy-washy and hampered by cliche, sitting through this is like enduring a vampire life: it's one long wait for the end.", "Overall this horror picture, based on Rice's novel, is no good, but lead stuart Townsend gives a far more compelling (and properly campy) performance than Tom Cruise did as Lestat in the high-profile companion piece, Interview With the Vampire.", "Rice's complex, sprawling novel is rendered virtually incomprehensible by a combination of lacklustre direction, risible dialogue and shoddy effects.", "Queen of the Damned is not a good film, but it's definitely a watchable one.", "Tom Cruise had the good sense to stay away from reprising his role of Lestat in this film.", "Aaliyah steals the show as a villainous vampiric vixen in an otherwise ludicrous waste of a story.", "This film should have stayed in its coffin and never seen the light of day.", "...the film's disjointed narrative makes it near impossible to ever become completely engrossed.", "Anne Rice goes heavy metal in Hollywood's latest installment of bloodsucker cinema.", "For a horror film that is supposed to have thrills and lots of gore, one is left feeling they went to see a comedy for all the nonsense there is."], "rating": ["", "1.5/5", "1.5/4", "", "", "", "2/5", "1/5", "1/4", "", "2/5", "C-", "", "2/5", "0.5/5", "3.5/10", "1/4", "2/4", "2.5/4", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Pat Stacey", "Steve Newton", "Matt Brunson", "Lisa Alspector", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Scott Foundas", "Mark Halverson", "Rob Gonsalves", "Peter Travers", "Kamal  &#39;The Diva&#39; Larsuel", "", "Emanuel Levy", "", "Michael Dequina", "Gareth J.
