{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In present-day London, 12-year-old Quinn watches as his mother wakes an enormous fire-breathing beast from its centuries-long slumber. Twenty years later, much of the world has been scarred by the beast and its offspring. As a fire chief, Quinn (Christian Bale) is responsible for warding off the beasts and keeping a community alive as they eke out a meager existence. Into their midst comes a hotshot American, Van Zan (Matthew McConaughey), who says he has a way to kill the beasts.", "rating": "42", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Rob Bowman", "studio": "SpyglassEntertainment", "theater_date": "Jul 12, 2002", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$43.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The characters are sketchy, the plot is full of logical holes and the story is all fight and flight. But despite its flaws, it is enjoyable if you like special effects, warriors and computer-generated dragons.", "For all its silliness, Reign of Fire never bores, and may actually appeal to your inner twelve-year-old.", "The poor dragons - on screen not nearly enough as it is - stand no chance pitted against this kind of heavyweight ham.", "Better than the trailers made it seem, but nothing to get fired up about.", "For all of its design and special-effects artistry, \"Reign of Fire\" is seldom convincing -- only slightly more alive than the silly 2000 \"Dungeons & Dragons.\"", "Look too closely at it, and you'll find a question or two that aren't satisfactorily answered by film's end. But it deserves high marks for not being quite like anything else -- for being, in fact, just different enough to impress.", "If you are prepared to overlook the gaping holes in the plot (how did the Yanks wind up on Tyneside?) then this one definitely has wings.", "The sole spark of humanity comes from Matthew McConaughey, whose gung-ho glee brings a hint of excitement and adventure to this hugely unsatisfying feature.", "Reign of Fire is a well-paced film; a product of excellent editing and a tight, salient script. And more to its credit, the action sets this film apart.", "An odd cross between Mad Max and Dragonheart, this movie is all borrowed ideas, but it's still trashy fun.", "McConaughey's soldier chews more scenery than even the toothiest of the dragons.", "It's the kind of earnest, no-nonsense monster movie Hollywood used to toss out in the 1950s, and it works for one reason only: The ability of a handful of good actors, and monster movie-loving filmmakers, to keep a straight face.", "\"Is that dragon's breath?\" a child asks Quinn, as a fetid wind rumples his hair. Yes it is, and boy does it stink.", "A cautionary tale about being careful what you wish for, in this case an extended Tube network. It's an enjoyably doomy B-movie, played straight apart from an Empire Strikes Back \"I am your father!\" scene featuring the most bouncily over-acting kids ever.", "Reign of Fire is one of the most intense and enjoyable monster flicks I've ever seen.", "Dragons, man. That's all we're really here to see, and they do not disappoint in the slightest.", "Plodding sci-fi dragon disaster tale is OK for older kids.", "Garners so much potential for a large exciting universe, but is just a waste of acting talent, special effects and money", "The main problem with the film (and there's a lot of competition there) is the writing - or lack thereof.", "The climactic SFX are well mounted and it's all too preposterous to dislike."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "3/5", "2/5", "", "", "2/4", "", "", "3.5/5", "4/5", "6/10", "2/5", "", "1/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["SMH Staff", "Anthony Quinn", "Tim Robey", "Leah Rozen", "Malcolm Johnson", "John Wooley", "Tim Evans", "Sloan Freer", "Steve Head", "Hank Sartin", "Stephen Humphries", "Christopher Borrelli", "Tizzy Asher", "Sarah Cartland", "Steve Newton", "Tim Brayton", "Charles Cassady", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Joe Lozito", "Wally Hammond"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sydney Morning Herald", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sky Cinema", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IGN Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Toledo Blade", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Stranger (Seattle, WA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Caution Spoilers", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Georgia Straight", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Big Picture Big Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out"], "date": ["March 31, 2019", "March 31, 2019", "March 31, 2019", "March 31, 2019", "March 31, 2019", "March 31, 2019", "March 31, 2019", "March 31, 2019", "March 31, 2019", "March 31, 2019", "March 31, 2019", "March 31, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "December 29, 2018", "February 8, 2014", "December 21, 2012", "September 14, 2010", "April 29, 2009", "July 14, 2007", "February 9, 2006"]}}
