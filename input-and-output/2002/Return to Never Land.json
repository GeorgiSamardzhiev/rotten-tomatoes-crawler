{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Wendy is all grown up, with children of her own, and as the blitzkrieg rages, she calms them with tales of Peter Pan. Wendy's stubborn 12-year-old daughter, Jane, has no patience for such nonsense until Capt. Hook uses the girl as a pawn in capturing his arch-rival. Peter Pan, Tinker Bell, and the Lost Boys come to her aid; however, even they cannot make Jane a believer in the magic of imagination. Unless she believes, she cannot fly, and there is no other way for her to return home.", "rating": "46", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Animation/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 12m", "director": "Robin Budd", "studio": "WaltDisneyPictures", "theater_date": "Feb 15, 2002", "dvd_date": "Apr 24, 2018", "box_office": "$48.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Measures up to its predecessor in almost every way, marking this as one of the best of the Disney sequels.", "Everything about the film is dated, from plotting to animation.", "Maybe this was a film that didn't need to be made, but parents with small children will be glad that Disney did, because it's a kinder, gentler trip to Never Land than the original, and a much safer bet for young children.", "[Blu-ray Review] \"Return to Never Land\" is (1) a terrific motion picture, and (2) absolutely gorgeous to watch and listen to.
