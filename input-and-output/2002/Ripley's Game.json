{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The third book in Patricia Highsmith's Ripley series, \"Ripley's Ball\" is set in present day Italy, where art connoisseur, harpsichord aficionado, master of souffl\u00e9s and genius of improvisational murder, Ripley (John Malkovich) finds his complacency shaken when he is scorned at a local party. While any ordinary sociopath might repay the insult with some mild act of retribution, the game Ripley has in mind is far subtler, and infinitely more sinister.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 50m", "director": "Liliana Cavani", "studio": "Cattleya,Mr.Mudd", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 1, 2011", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A surprising film with so much going for it including a lot of intrigue in Hitchcockian proportions...", "", "Malkovich is perhaps the best, most chillingly precise Ripley to date.", "", "See this film for its story and for Malkovich' performance, or if you are easily distracted and irritated, buy the book and imagine everything yourself instead.", "Ripley's Game draws you in with its virtuoso performances and moody aura of menace.", "Representative of the fear and loathing attendant to the death rattle of domestic culture.", "Now we have the real Ripley: John Malkovich.", "John Malkovich [delivers] a performance that's as playful as it is perverse.", "No  surpresa constatar que John Malkovich se revela o melhor entre os quatro intrpretes do personagem.", "As slithery and seductive a thriller as you'll find.", "Arguably the most satisfying distillation of Highsmith's nastiness, ingenuity and humor, with the added dividend of Mr. Malkovich's diabolical charm and insouciance.", "The movie may, late in Cavani's career, come to be seen as her best work.", "Malkovich steals the show and director Liliana Cavani ... does a perfectly serviceable job.", "John Malkovich is perfectly cast as the amoral epicurean", "Cavani uses a seedy, spying camera and beautiful European locations to draw us into the action and dress it up as art. She's a sick puppy, but she's good at what she does.", "", "Like most sequels, the film hasn't the allure of the first encounter; only the curiosity value of a second look.
