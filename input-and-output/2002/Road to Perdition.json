{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Mike Sullivan (Tom Hanks) is an enforcer for powerful Depression-era Midwestern mobster John Rooney (Paul Newman). Rooney's son, Connor (Daniel Craig), is jealous of the close bond they share, and when Mike's eldest son, Michael (Tyler Hoechlin), witnesses a hit, Connor uses the incident as an excuse to murder Sullivan's wife (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and youngest son. Forced to flee, Sullivan and Michael set out on a journey of revenge and self-discovery.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "Sam Mendes", "studio": "ZanuckCompany", "theater_date": "Jul 12, 2002", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$104.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Casting Hanks as a heavy is no mistake here, and though the gamble is not entirely successful it's a fine experiment.", "A beautiful elegy to a decaying world whose sadness lingers on.", "Gangsters.

[Full review in Spanish]", "V&#65279;ery little of Road to Perdition lingers, except for a feeling that you've been carried along.", "Crisply, starchily self-conscious in its efforts to be a gangster epic. A pretty-enough remote place, with its rain and snow and fedoras and trenchcoats, but it's still a long way from Boardwalk Empire and Miller's Crossing.", "So is Perdition still a must-see? No question. But it's tough to fuss about it much when a picture is this fussy.", "Visually, the picture is all of a piece, but it's a self-conscious piece of work -- all dark-toned academic classicism.", "What makes the movie pay off is moving pictures of real action and of intimate scenes between man and boy that are all the more moving for being understated.", "Powerful, beautiful film; ok for mature teens.", "The top-billed actors deliver: Hanks with his resonant reserve and Newman in conveying Rooney's failed attempt to live up to his self-image as the ultimate just and loving patriarch. [Blu-ray]", "...something more than the sum of its parts; namely, a gripping, touching, entertaining motion picture.", "This last motif surges in the film's coda with a sequence that is 2002's most rapturous, a long, undulating shot that combines serenity and horror.", "Director Sam Mendes is on course to become one of the great directors of this decade.", "A true work of art from [director] Sam Mendes...", "It's Newman who really stands out. Despite his advanced years -- he's 77 -- the man still has remarkable presence.", "While crisply edited and unindulgent, Mendes' work is gratifyingly old-school in its rejection of modern-day stylistic agitation, the better to achieve a slow but inexorable build to its climax.", "Hanks and Newman are the personification of anguish and torn loyalty in a gripping, violent film that is part character study and part cat-and-mouse chase with classic western embellishments.", "Road is so beautiful, so well composed and so tidy in its sense of justice that it never quite gets its hands dirty enough to evoke any true emotion.", "Sam Mendes's 2002 follow-up to American Beauty finds him every bit as adept, arty, and Oscar hungry.", "Ploughing a furrowed brow, Hanks is fatally miscast -- except that the story turns so sentimental and bathetic, he's actually in his element."], "rating": ["", "3/4", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "4/5", "3/4", "8/10", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "4/5", "3/4", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Rollison", "Namrata Joshi", "Alberto Abu\u00edn", "Stuart Klawans", "Brian Gibson", "Mike Clark", "David Denby", "Joe Morgenstern", "Nell Minow", "Peter Canavese", "John J.
