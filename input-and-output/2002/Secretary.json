{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Lee Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a young woman with a history of severe emotional problems, is released into the care of her overbearing parents following a stay at a mental institution. She finds work as a secretary for a rigid and demanding attorney, E. Edward Grey (James Spader), and starts dating the kind but dull Peter (Jeremy Davies). However, Lee soon realizes she's turned on by Grey's stern demeanor, and begins a sadomasochistic relationship with him.", "rating": "76", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 52m", "director": "Steven Shainberg", "studio": "SloughPond,TwoPoundBagProductions,DoubleAFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 20, 2015", "box_office": "$4.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Presenting the original Mr. Gray. Maggie Gyllenhaal's Lee Halloway and James Spader's E. Edward Gray are a top notch duo of lawyer and secretary...", "all at once a post-feminist fairy tale about the flowering self-realisation of a young woman, a parable of therapeutic recovery, and an allegory of office politics - but ultimately Lee seems far easier to tie up than to pin down.", "Spader handles a tricky role beautifully, but this is Gyllenhaals's tour de force. She is remarkable and original.", "... Secretary shows how one woman stopped at nothing to get her love. But I'm still scratching my head at the whole thing.", "[Secretary] manages the impossible trifecta of being simultaneously funny, sympathetic, and really, really hot.", "This is a film that is in on the joke but doesn't make light of its subject matter.", "Shainberg sets up a restless quality in both characters, and he takes them very seriously but it still comes as a bit of shock to see what is normally considered to be sexist behavior finally and ultimately embraced.", "Absolutely terrific, tight, and focused filmmaking.", "", "", "\"Secretary\" recalibrates the capabilities of meaningful romantic comedy - a \"Pygmalion\" variation that's stealthily tender, witty but never broad and scintillatingly erotic to the point of palpitations. Gyllenhaal and Spader give career-best work.", "Steven Shainberg maintains a level of erotic suspense and anticipation that his terribly empathetic characters fulfill with pleasantly surprising acts of physical expression.", "A fascinating and eccentric character study, and study of unconventional relationships fueled by fetish...", "A feel-good movie about sadomasochism, the seriocomic Secretary manages to be simultaneously subversive and sweet...In the wrong hands, the conceit could have turned ugly and offensive. But Spader and Gyllenhaal have a hushed, hilarious chemistry.", "", "", "This S&M satire teeters on the verge of sleaze and exploitation but never descends into those domains due to Maggie Gyllenhaal's exquisite performance in a tricky role.", "A twisted and very funny rethinking of the romantic comedy genre. Great performances by Spader and Gyllenhaal.", "", ""], "rating": ["", "", "", "B", "", "", "3.5/4", "8/10", "5/5", "A-", "4/4", "A", "", "", "3/4", "4/5", "B", "7", "2.5/5", "3.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Casey Cipriani", "Anton Bitel", "Barbara Ellen", "Candice Frederick", "Lindy West", "Brooke Corso", "Eric Melin", "Tim Brayton", "Jennie Kermode", "Owen Gleiberman", "Nick Rogers", "Cole Smithey", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "David Ansen", "Joe Lozito", "", "Emanuel Levy", "Dan Jardine", "", ""], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bustle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Projected Figures", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Talk Online", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Stranger (Seattle, WA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Monitor (McAllen, TX)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lawrence.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Gurus", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Yap", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Big Picture Big Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemania", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat"], "date": ["November 16, 2020", "March 15, 2020", "January 2, 2018", "September 11, 2017", "August 25, 2017", "August 16, 2017", "June 12, 2015", "March 1, 2015", "November 9, 2011", "September 7, 2011", "September 23, 2010", "June 25, 2010", "April 29, 2009", "November 1, 2007", "July 14, 2007", "December 30, 2006", "December 3, 2006", "April 22, 2006", "December 6, 2005", "December 6, 2005"]}}
