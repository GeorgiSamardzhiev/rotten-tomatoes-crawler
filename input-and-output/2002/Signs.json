[Full Review in Spanish]", "Signs is a tense experience; even the opening credits lunge at your throat with orchestral shrieks. It may one day reveal itself as a minor classic, a new Invasion of the Body Snatchers for the manufactured scare of its day.", "An emotional, yet old-fashioned scary movie punctuated with terror and psychological suspense, Signs will have you holding your breath, biting your nails and sitting on the edge of your seat - even long after the film has ended.", "It's the content that's to blame. Signs works on a confused storyboard. What's Shyamalan trying to say anyways? Nothing, or rather a bit too much.", "Enthralled by his own genius and desire to make another blockbuster, Shyamalan has taken a terrific B-movie idea and inflated it into what he wants us to believe is a serious commentary on faith.", "Signs manages to be creepy, emotional, and thrilling all at once.", "Shyamalan may not be Hitchcock hut so far he's made the best 1950s B-movie of the 21st century.", "Signs was the film that sparked the desire that led to the purchase of a camera, many short films, and a love of movies that hasn't left me to this day.", "", "Excellent, but has some extreme tension and peril.", "Shyamalan is 0 for 3, giving us another incredible movie.", "", "An anti-Independence Day, a cousin of Close Encounters, but most of all, a well-modulated, dread-laden, faith-based mystery. [Blu-Ray]", "Crap circles.", "Mr. Shayamalan is a gifted writer and filmmaker. He definitely has more great films in his future. However, he may need to take a step away from the paranormal thriller.", "Individual sequences generate an eerie tension that's always deflated, creating a jarring stop-and-go rhythm, and the atmospheric trickery never strays beyond a lot of smoke and mirrors.", "Shyamalan is technically a superb film-maker, for all that he's picked up most of his tricks from Spielberg and Hitchcock.", "M. Night Shyamalan's Signs is Close Encounters of the Corny Kind.", "I come away from Signs exhilarated by Shyamalan's skill at keeping his audience guessing.", "The one good thing about it is that it's over in one hour and 47 minutes.
