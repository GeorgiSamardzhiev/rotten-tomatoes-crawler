{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Based on the classic science fiction novel by Stanislaw Lem, \"Solaris\" centers on a psychologist (George Clooney) sent to investigate unexplained behavior of key scientists on a space station orbiting the planet Solaris.

[Full Review in Spanish]", "One of the few true Oscar candidates of the year, this is an all around masterpiece.", "Whereas Tarkovsky's Solaris was a cerebral engagement with concepts of memory, relativity and Lacanian theory, Soderbergh's is a classy narrative piece - no more, no less.", "Solaris is just boring. It's dull. God, is it dull! Dull! Dull! Dull! Dull! Dull!", "...it remains a fascinating work and its deep questioning of what makes us human when faced with simulacrums feels if anything more relevant today than when it was made.", "Steven Soderbergh prunes Andrei Tartovsky's 1972 film (based on Stanislaw Lem's novel) to the clarity and concision of a great short story - a forlorn, philosophical sci-fi romance treading the terrain of \"Blade Runner's\" metaphysical melancholy.", "A thought provoking, fascinating and heart breaking glimpse into characters that must come to grips with their past.", "Steven Soderbergh's extremely sedate, Spartan science-fiction thriller and love story pits man's common sense and perceptions of a higher power against his own dreams and desires.", "It's an unusual challenge for a Hollywood film with a major star, but worth the effort.", "While Mr. Soderbergh's direction is always compelling, the whole film does not always equal the sum of its parts.", "Scripted, shot, directed and edited by Soderbergh with his customary intelligence and assurance, this is perhaps the most ambiguous and cerebrally sophisticated Hollywood movie in nearly three decades.", "fascinating, despite its flaws", "Soderbergh's Solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem.", "Soderbergh's latest may well leave Stanislaw Lem grumbling. My bet is virtually everyone else will be blown away.", "The images are crisp and the pacing faultless, as you'd expect with Soderbergh, and the soundtrack (with music by Cliff Martinez) is an environment in itself.", "Many will justifiably find [it] a heady experience akin to 90 minutes of watching paint dry. Others will see that paint forming something close to a masterpiece.", "Based on Stanislaw Lem's novel and Andrei Tarkovsky's sci-fi epic, Soderbergh's Solaris is drastically abridged and the most sentimental of the three.", "", "It remains as remote as Pluto from the audience.", "An unoriginal piece of originality.
