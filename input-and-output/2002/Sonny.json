However, the financial difficulties faced by his mother, Jewel (Brenda Blethyn), who is also a prostitute, make escaping his former life difficult. With few job prospects, Sonny reluctantly begins working the streets.

What is sorely missing, however, is the edge of wild, lunatic invention that we associate with Cage's best acting.", "There's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie, about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present.", "An instant candidate for worst movie of the year.", "Author John Carlen has abstrusely captured that struggle of one man simply trying to be human in nonhuman, vile, circumstances.", "Keep your day job, Nicolas Cage. This shockingly inept directorial debut reveals the brooding actor to be a hackneyed helmer.", "Nicolas Cage isn't the first actor to lead a group of talented friends astray, and this movie won't create a ruffle in what is already an erratic career.", "Earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock.", "Franco is an excellent choice for the walled-off but combustible hustler, but he does not give the transcendent performance SONNY needs to overcome gaps in character development and story logic.", "It is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental, and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients.", "Preposterous and tedious, Sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that, unfortunately, occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure.", "Amid the clich and foreshadowing, Cage manages a degree of casual realism ... that is routinely dynamited by Blethyn.", "John Carlen's script is full of unhappy, two-dimensional characters who are anything but compelling."], "rating": ["4/5", "2/5", "2/5", "2.5/5", "1/4", "", "2/5", "2/4", "2.5/4", "C", "1/4", "3.5/4", "F", "", "2/5", "B-", "3.5/5", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Cole Smithey", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "Emanuel Levy", "Christopher Null", "Glenn Kenny", "MaryAnn Johanson", "Ken Fox", "Jan Stuart", "Bob Strauss", "Brent Simon", "Lou Lumenick", "Emily Blunt", "", "Michael Agger", "A.O.
