{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this hilarious comedy, Dave (Barry Watson), Adam (Michael Rosenbaum), and Doofer (Harland Williams) are about to go where no fraternity boy has gone before.

Sorority Boys isn't most movies", "...an hour and a half of dumb, smutty, slovenly, lecherous people doing dumb, smutty, slovenly, lecherous things.", "", "The film is directed by Wally Wolodarsky from a script by Joe Jarvis and Greg Coolidge. These are names to remember, in order to avoid them in the future.", "Pretend like your SAT scores are below 120 and you might not notice the flaws.", "", "The premise for this kegger comedy probably sounded brilliant four six-packs and a pitcher of margaritas in, but the film must have been written ... in the thrall of a vicious hangover.", "...expects us to laugh at the utter stupidity of the characters. But that doesn't work when the movie is equally as stupid.", "This isn't a great movie, but it may surprise you.", "The utterly worthless Sorority Boys must represent the absolute low point of teen comedies, which is really saying something.", "Never quite rises to the level of self-conscious parody, but merely replicates the same old stereotypes.", "Not only unfunny, but downright repellent.", "A one-trick pony whose few T&A bits still can't save itself from being unoriginal, unfunny and unrecommendable.", "Full of witless jokes, dealing in broad stereotypes and outrageously unbelievable scenarios, and saddled with a general air of misogyny", "The writers, director Wally Wolodarsky, and all the actors should start their own coeducational fraternity: Kappa Rho Alpha Phi.", ""], "rating": ["", "", "1.5/5", "3/5", "1/4", "3/10", "C-", "D-", "2.5/5", "2.5/5", "", "", "B", "", "", "", "3/10", "1.5/4", "1/5", "4/10"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Debbie Lynn Elias", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Scott Weinberg", "Eric Campos", "Steve Rhodes", "John J.
