{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1940s China, small-town landowner Liyan (Wu Jun) leads a sad existence; his property is in ruins, his health isn't much better, his marriage to wife Yuwen (Hu Jingfan) is almost loveless and the presence of his boisterous teen sister Xiu (Lu Sisi) only makes things worse. Then Zhang (Xin Baiqing), a doctor who is an ex-lover of Yuwen's and a boyhood chum of Liyan's, arrives to treat the ailing man. He brings passion back into the household, but also extreme tension.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "Zhuangzhuang Tian", "studio": "BeijingFilmStudio", "theater_date": "Oct 9, 2002", "dvd_date": "Dec 14, 2004", "box_office": "$42.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A bad movie, which at times tests the patience of the audience. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Tian's new version is an assiduously respectful homage, yet a new work of art in its own right.", "The lead characters smoulder without ever catching aflame, while director Tian Zhuangzhaung weaves a disturbing web of deceit and betrayal.", "As vibrant as a live play in its impact, with its characters almost as tangible, this film draws on not just the words and emotions of the original material, but the classic language of earlier cinema.", "Beautifully photographed by Mark Lee (who also co-shot Wong Kar-Wai's In The Mood For Love), and delicately played by an untried cast, this confirms Tian as the Fifth Generation's unsung master.", "The result is paradoxically more theatrical than the original -- but thanks to serene cinematography and superb design, sumptuously so.", "If you can go with the film's leisurely flow and accept the restraints it holds its lovers in check with, it can be a spellbinding film experience.", "Tian guides his story with great smoothness, providing a hint of unease with his constantly gliding camera and his penchant for viewing the action from behind grated windows and other obstacles.", "Only a director who truly knows repression could have made a movie so subtle and so understanding.", "Crafted in a style that seems to be learned from films of the thirties and, for all its scope, might have been adapted from a stage play.", "Even potentially crushing situations are diffused by the respect each character has for one another.", "There aren't a lot of plot complications in Springtime, a remake of a celebrated 1948 Chinese film of the same name. It's the way Tian tells his story that impresses.", "[Springtime in a Small Town is] a quiet, thoughtful and beautifully wrought film.", "Springtime in a Small Town moves at a leisurely pace. And because it's a work of taste and tact, you can watch it in a pleasurable state.", "The drama can seem tepid from a contemporary Western perspective. But there's usually a tasty morsel of cinematography or performance just around the corner.", "Reinventing his source just as boldly as he has reinvented his artistic identity, Tian circumvents the usual mentality of remakes by making his material brand-new.", "It's heartbreak without the hysterics, and it's as beautiful as a still-life painting which makes you cry without you even understanding why.", "What makes [it] so effective is Tian's very carefully wrought visual style and the performances of his tiny cast.", "Haunting film.", "This isn't a radical film by any means, but in its gentle tempo, its avoidance of the obvious and stubborn insistence on the decency of its three touchingly human characters, 'Springtime in a Small Town' weighs in as refreshingly, pleasurably different."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "B+", "4/4", "3/4", "2/5", "3.5/4", "3/4", "B+", "3/5", "3.5/5", "3/4", "A", "", "3/4", "4/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Alberto Abu\u00edn", "Alexander Walker", "", "Urban Cinefile Critics", "", "Derek Adams", "Dennis Schwartz", "Jeffrey M.
