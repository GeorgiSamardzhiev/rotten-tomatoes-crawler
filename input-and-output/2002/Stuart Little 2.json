And Stuart's a sweet talker if ever there was one.", "I don't know what director Minkoff did differently this time around, but whatever it is, he's done it right.", "The seamless integration of the CG animal characters with real-life ones and the general storybook look of the film remains impressive, but this being the second go-round it's that less dazzling; ditto for Nathan Lane's amusing wisecracks.", "Entertaining children's film that hits all the right notes -- funny, colourful and fast-paced, with terrific animation and an exciting climax.", "The mouse, with the voice of Michael J.
