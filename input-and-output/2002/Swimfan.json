{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Ben Cronin (Jesse Bradford) has it all: the admiration of his many friends, a terrific girlfriend, and he's on the fast-track to an athletic scholarship. Ben's rock-solid, promising future and romance are turned upside-down with the arrival of Madison Bell (Erika Christensen). Madison, the new girl in town, quickly sets her sights on the impressionable Ben. While their first few meetings are innocent enough, the obsessive and seductive Madison wants more ... much more.", "rating": "15", "genre": "Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 24m", "director": "John Polson", "studio": "FurtherFilms,ForrestFilms,GreeneStreetFilmsInc.", "theater_date": "Sep 6, 2002", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$28.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An erotic thriller that is neither erotic nor thrilling.

Or, even worse, a teen version of Fatal Attraction?", "Seguindo o tom juvenil (no sentido pejorativo da palavra) do roteiro, podemos descrever este filme com uma regra de trs simples: Fixao est para Atrao Fatal assim como Erika Christensen est para Glenn Close.", "No points for originality, but young audiences will lap up the mix of nubile teens and cheap shocks, while the solid performances provide something for less hormone-ravaged viewers.", "...fifty minutes of tedious adolescent melodramatics followed by thirty-five minutes of inflated nonsense.", "Christensen is clearly the best thing about this movie; her transition from a pretty, personable high school girl to a psychotic killer is subtle and disturbing.
