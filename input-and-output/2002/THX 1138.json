{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the future, mankind lives in vast underground cities and free will is outlawed by means of mandatory medication that controls human emotion. But when THX 1138 (Robert Duvall) and LUH 3417 (Maggie McOmie) stop taking their meds, they wake up to the bleak reality of their own existence and fall in love with each other in the process. But love is also illegal in this Orwellian dystopia, and the act of making love has made both of them outlaws on the run from an army of robotic police.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "George Lucas", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,ZoetropeStudios", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2008", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...devoid of even the most basic exposition designed to draw the viewer into its oddball futuristic landscape...", "THX 1138 isn't a perfect sci-film but it is solidly entertaining and very unique.", "Despite his scenes of bland horror, Lucas offers the 25th century as a arch, campy place, a conception not satiric enough to be accepted as comedy and not quite insightful enough to be taken seriously.", "long and cumbersome", "The empty space surrounding the vulnerable man emphasizes the exertion involved rather than the goal of escape: like the hologram who came to life because he wanted to, THX finally achieves his humanity by an assertion of will.", "Slow sci-fi drama for die hard Lucas fans only.", "Tedious pacing contributes to the confusing nature of the movie, but George Lucas' restored \"THX-1138\" is essential viewing to distinguish his artistic vision before he transformed Hollywood.", "Meditative and downbeat rather than crowd-pleasing, the film includes a few sequences that suggest the direction Lucas career later took.", "With political paternalism rampant at both extremes of the spectrum, Lucas is onto something. In any case, we'll know for sure in about a generation.", "Enhancing the film with special effects and a clearer presentation, Lucas has turned something that was relatively unwatchable into something that can endure as a sci-fi classic.", "Visually it is often extraordinary, with Lucas playing on perspectives and dislocations throughout, nowhere more brilliantly than in the 'prison' represented by a limbo of whiteness that seems to stretch as far as the eye can see.", "Masterpiece? I'd hazard to say so, for as much of what it says to what it leaves to the viewer.", "A high concept window in on the direction George Lucas could have gone.", "For sheer visual risk-taking, THX is by far Lucas' most impressive work, and one well worth seeing on the big screen. At least once in your life you should see Robert Duvall with freckles as big as your head.", "", "", "", "The general bleakness of the film, its themes and the author's youthful anger could not be erased with digital technology.", "I have a good many reservations about the film's ideas, but they are greatly outweighed by my admiration for a technical virtuosity that by fair means and foul achieves exceptional emotional intensity at the same time.", "A modest, somber vision of the future."], "rating": ["1/4", "B", "", "2/5", "", "3/5", "A-", "3/4", "", "3/4", "", "5/5", "3/5", "", "3/5", "4/5", "3/5", "8/10", "4/5", "C+"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Nusair", "Rachel Wagner", "Stefan Kanfer", "Kevin Carr", "William Paul", "David Gurney", "Cole Smithey", "", "A.D.
