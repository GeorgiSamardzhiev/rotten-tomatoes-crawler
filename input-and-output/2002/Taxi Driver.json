{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Suffering from insomnia, disturbed loner Travis Bickle (Robert De Niro) takes a job as a New York City cabbie, haunting the streets nightly, growing increasingly detached from reality as he dreams of cleaning up the filthy city. When Travis meets pretty campaign worker Betsy (Cybill Shepherd), he becomes obsessed with the idea of saving the world, first plotting to assassinate a presidential candidate, then directing his attentions toward rescuing 12-year-old prostitute Iris (Jodie Foster).", "rating": "96", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Martin Scorsese", "studio": "Bill/Phillips,Italo/JudeoProductions,ColumbiaPictures", "theater_date": "Feb 8, 1976", "dvd_date": "Dec 6, 2013", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A dark, powerful, stylized, potent production that takes the viewer deeper into a persona of insanity and alienation than many will want to go.", "One of the all-time great movies.", "The incredible cast includes Albert Brooks, Peter Boyle, Scorsese regular Harvey Keitel and a very young Jodie Foster...", "Taxi Driver is a compelling drama of urban anomie that will remain significant for years to come. Like Joe and Easy Rider, it is an important film treatment of major moral and social questions.", "The problem lies less with what the film has to say than the way it says it: the laboriousness with which its sermon on the seeds of fascism is spelled out.", "It's no surprise that these iconic characters in these solo driven films are played by some of the greatest actors of all time. Al Pacino. Robert De Niro.", "A film of rare power and unique forcefulness.", "If in Taxi Driver Scorsese's trying to show us that our cities are becoming like those of Clockwork Orange, Kubrick already did that four years ago, without nearly as much obscenity or gore.", "Taxi Driver is brilliantly directed by Martin Scorsese, and Robert De Niro and Jodie Foster are outstanding. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Watching it isn't always a pleasant experience, but it is a necessary one.", "An absolutely nailed-on portrait of solipsism in its purest form, and how, in Travis' case, it takes hold as a lethal cocktail of narcissism, paranoia and gross sociopathy.", "No other film has ever dramatized urban indifference so powerfully; at first, here, it's horrifyingly funny, and then just horrifying.", "Travis Bickle's trouble was that he couldn't get close to anyone, but Robert De Niro's trouble is that he can't get past the audio-visual pandemonium to show you Bickle's torment from inside.", "\"Herrmann's score moves like Bickle's eyeballs do: scanning, searching...left, center, right...searching...searching...for something it will never find.\"", "if Travis is a contradiction, then so is the Vietnam-era United States in which he walks and drives - a schizophrenic environment where violence is always bubbling beneath the surface of dignity, decency and democracy.", "... a primal portrait and uncompromising vision carved out of the New York night, the summer heat, and the garbage of the Times Square cesspool.", "As with John Wayne's Ethan Edwards (Travis's spiritual forefather), his thwarted patriarchal possessiveness is not tempered by anything like genuine concern, yet it is enough... to make him a peculiarly American folk hero.", "Taxi Driver's undiminished power owes partially to Scorsese's harnessing of Michael Johnson's restless camerawork.", "A remarkable, disturbing film with an unforgettable musical score from the great Bernard Herrmann.", "It's a spiritual film, tracking Robert De Niro's 'Nam vet as he takes the wrong path towards cleaning New York's streets, minds and souls."], "rating": ["1", "", "4/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Allen Almachar", "Tom Meek", "David A.
