{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A female taxi driver (Mania Akbari) ferries 10 different passengers around Tehran, Iran -- exposing herself to a wide swathe of the city's populace and shedding light on the plight of women in the country. Among those who set foot inside her cab are a prostitute and an elderly woman on her way to prayer. But there are also a multitude of familiar faces, including a friend who's broken up with her boyfriend and the driver's own son, who lashes out at his mother over divorcing his father.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Art House & International/Documentary/Drama/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 34m", "director": "Abbas Kiarostami", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 14, 2016", "box_office": "$105.7K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "Often provokes humor and refreshing insights.", "", "", "", "...

Ten is not only a fascinating character study, but a portrait of an entire way of life.", "A little more reach would have allowed Ten to turn it up to 11.", "Whatever the film lacks in physical lyricism, it makes up for with a claustrophobic flair that leads you to conclude that Ten can be the loneliest number.", "Works in its own mysterious ways.", "A very interesting film, despite structural limitations that keep it from approaching greatness.", "A rare chance for viewers to eavesdrop on everyday talk in Tehran that, although fictionalized, must approximate what really happens in Iran's busy capital.", "For little more than the price of a tank of gas and a video camera, Kiarostami lets his viewers drive a mile in another's shoes.
