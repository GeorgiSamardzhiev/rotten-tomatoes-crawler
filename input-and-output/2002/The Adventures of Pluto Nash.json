{"metadata": {"synopsis": "\"Pluto Nash\" is an action comedy set on the moon in the year 2087, starring Eddie Murphy as the title character, an audacious nightclub owner who finds himself in hot water when he refuses to sell his club to the local mob.

It's there but it's not there. It is but it isn't. It has nothing to offer. It's not forgettable, really, because there's nothing to forget.", "Complete with a Xanadu-style dance routine, Pam Grier as Pluto's mother indulging in tired blaxploitation moves and rent-a-cameo John Cleese as a virtual reality chauffeur, this is a flop of epic proportions.", "It's a weak effort that amounts to a universal waste of talent and time.", "Is it as bad as all that? Oh yes.", "Formulaic films are released every week, but it's rare that one has a $100 million budget, big stars whose roles are embarrassing to watch and unusual special effects that only serve to mask a predictable plot and cliche-ridden scenes.", "Pluto Nash will set lunar exploration back decades.", "Murphy sleepwalks through it, and who can blame him?", "An action-comedy vehicle factory-made from worn clichs, wearing riffs and virtually vacuum-sealed away from both adventure and laughs.", "With colossal sets, a remarkable cast, and hundreds of extras, this sci-fi comedy-adventure spoof of '30s movies should be funny and adventuresome, but it falls flat.", "Murphy and Underwood must have had a lot of explaining to do.", "Despite being set in 2080, The Adventures Of Pluto Nash only makes you hanker for the days when Eddie Murphy really was take-no-prisoners funny.", "A paralyzingly dopey mess, Pluto sat on the shelf for more than a year while Warner Bros. tried to inject some life into it. You might as well try to revive a stuffed moose.", "A waste of talent and money, Pluto Nash seems convinced that simply sticking Eddie Murphy in outer space with expensive special effects will produce laughs.", "Forensics experts will be digging through the rubble of this fiasco for a long time, trying to reconstruct the accident. How did so many lines fall flat? Why were the action scenes so corny and unconvincing? Who put the stink on this?", "It's a real turkey.", "An abundance of noise, explosions, gunplay, chases, special effects, futuristic eye candy and star power (including John Cleese, Pam Grier and Peter Boyle) generates very little pure fun or excitement in this cluttered visit to the moon.", "Some diverting cameos, but Murphy struggles to keep this one grounded."], "rating": ["", "1/4", "0/10", "", "1/5", "", "", "1/4", "", "", "1.5/5", "1.5/4", "", "2/5", "1/4", "", "1.5/4", "", "1/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Debbie Lynn Elias", "Matt Brunson", "Jeffrey Lyles", "Stephen Hunter", "Alan Jones", "Dennis King", "Roger Moore", "Jonathan Curiel", "Christopher Borrelli", "", "James Keith La Croix", "M.
