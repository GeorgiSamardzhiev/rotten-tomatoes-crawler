{"metadata": {"synopsis": "High school student Haru (Chizuru Ikewaki) rescues a cat that was about to be run over by a truck and discovers the cat is actually a prince named Lune. Out of gratitude, Lune's father, the Cat King, asks her to marry Lune. Haru is brought to the Cat Kingdom, where she starts to develop feline features. When she is prevented from leaving, the Baron (Yoshihiko Hakamada) and Toto, two statues that have magically been given life, provide assistance in gaining her freedom.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Animation/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 15m", "director": "Hiroyuki Morita", "studio": "StudioGhibli", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 16, 2020", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Miya-san may have said \"sayounara\" but the films made during his time will continue to inspire and delight.", "This movie exhibits a craft that belies Morita's inexperience as a director.", "While not the greatest Studio Ghibli film by any measure, I was thoroughly entertained by the creative and strange story of a young girl and her adventures in a world of cats.", "When it comes to grand fantasy tales of little girls lost in wonderfully strange worlds, The Cat Returns is no Spirited Away. Still, it's a serviceable children's adventure film, with some memorable moments.", "The Cat Returns...is all fluff, but it's cute and enjoyable fluff at the very least.", "The story whisks gracefully along with little saunters and pitter-patters of humour. A Princess-and-the-Cat tale that also coolly reflects the arrogant aloofness, suave superciliousness and intriguing independence of man's best-when-convenient friend.", "Undeniably sweet, but it is also undeniably slight, and not remotely as visually rich as we've all come to expect from Studio Ghibli.", "Director Morita does an exemplary job of bringing a Japanese graphic novel to the screen.", "Catchy entertainment for kids and adults...", "Interesting and watchable, but definitely not up to Miyazaki's standards.", "[Director] Morita has a slightly cruder, more realistic sense of the world and its looniness than does Miyazaki, and you can see where The Cat Returns moves on a different track even as it pays homage to Japan's current animation master.", "...moves along at a brisk clip and features a bright, vibrant animation style...", "The film has some of Miyazaki's exquisite timing, pacing and use of space.", "There's little tension or opportunity for emotional involvement in the brief story, and despite competent animation the cats are rarely anthropomorphised to good comic effect. One for anime -- and animal -- lovers only.", "Another enjoyable fantasy adventure from Studio Ghibli.", "despite its exquisite artwork and expert voice cast, this still looks a bit like the bedraggled runt of the Ghibli litter.", "An enchanting, magical fable with a twisted vein of surrealism that makes you wonder exactly what they're smoking over there in the Land of the Rising Sun.", "The crescendo of craziness makes for a brisk, funny, and wholly unique 75-minute ride.", "The Cat Returns is just a lovely family film.", "While the cats in this film are sentient, their attitude and egocentric behavior is strictly feline."], "rating": ["4/5", "7/10", "B", "", "C+", "", "7/10", "3.5/4", "", "3/5", "", "2.5/4", "3/4", "2/5", "", "", "3/5", "3/4", "8/10", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Ben Nicholson", "Sergio Non", "Rachel Wagner", "Austin Trunick", "Christopher Runyon", "Brian Gibson", "Tim Brayton", "Robert Pardi", "Lisa Nesselson", "Daniel Etherington", "Michael Booth", "David Nusair", "Jeffrey M.
