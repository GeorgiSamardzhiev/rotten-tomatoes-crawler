{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A true story about a coach who discovers that it's never too late for dreams to come true. Jim Morris (Dennis Quaid) never made it out of the minor leagues before a shoulder injury ended his pitching career twelve years ago. Now a married-with-children high-school chemistry teacher and baseball coach in Texas, Jim's team makes a deal with him: if they win the district championship, Jim will try out with a major-league organization.", "rating": "84", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 7m", "director": "John Lee Hancock", "studio": "WaltDisneyPictures,98MPHProductions", "theater_date": "Mar 29, 2002", "dvd_date": "Jul 8, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Welcome back to the cinematic big leagues, Dennis Quaid, we've missed you!", "Fathers and sons and baseball. There's no combination like it. The Rookie -- it's a swing -- it's a hit -- it's going, going, gone!!! A grand slam home run.", "At two-plus hours, The Rookie is a good 20 minutes too long, but for father-son teams waiting eagerly for the umpire's \"Play ball!\", it's an uplifting season opener.", "Morris ultimately lasted two partial seasons in the majors, and the film's rendering of his minor-league struggle is so enjoyable you want to see more of that and less of the everyday life preceding it.", "Though Hancock traffics in a lot of bogus small-town sentiment, The Rookie exhibits a refreshingly honest understanding of baseball as a job, with long road trips away from home and a workmanlike routine.", "As Morris, the reliable Quaid throws heat, delivering smoothly in dramatic scenes and convincingly from the mound.", "Refreshing and compelling.", "This entry in the genre is a true story that is, sadly, hampered by some signposted plot developments and undernourished characters.", "It's Quaid and his fellow actors, Rachel Griffiths and Brian Cox, who lift the film out of its intermittent doldrums, and together they deliver that rare thing: a nuanced sports movie.", "The Rookie is shot through with star-spangled sentiment, but its light touch and \"true story\" origins combine to make it feelgood fun even for schmaltz-phobic Brits.", "Until The Rookie came along, I'd forgotten how good and smart a family film can be.", "Slow moving, even pedestrian at times, yet this Dennis Quaid vehicle strikes a lot of genuinely heartwarming moments along the way.", "Deftly constructed to stoke the baseball-phenom fantasies of coulda-shoulda-woulda middle-aged guys and fields-of-dreaming young diamond studs.", "Earnest, uplifting baseball melodrama", "Sweet and engaging despite some flaws.", "In one of his greatest performances, Dennis Quaid puts nasty velocity and wicked movement on his delivery. A patient, emotionally honest sports film about resurrecting a dream and investing all you never knew you had.", "It spreads the inspirational butter thicker than the diamond action and buries the school team beneath Morris' quest for a new career, but develops a lyrical sense of what it's like to resurrect self-worth and chase one's dreams.", "Earnest to the point of blandness.", "The Rookie is one of those rare, wonderful 'formula' films that ... favors understatement over exaggeration, subtlety over sentimentality.", "I would almost rather have seen an A&E biography than a concocted Hollywood parable of unrealized dreams."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "3/5", "", "3/4", "", "C+", "4/5", "3.5/4", "3/5", "", "A", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Jack Mathews", "David Germain", "Scott Tobias", "Leah Rozen", "Glen Oliver", "Tom Hutchinson", "Bruce Diones", "", "Joe Morgenstern", "David N.
