It was a lavish and bold Arabian Nights swashbuckler-adventure film - and an epic, spectacular accomplishment in production design and revolutionary...", "One marvel after another", "Technology may have changed drastically in the nearly 90 years since this movie was produced, but some things never go out of style.", "It is an entrancing picture, wholesome and beautiful, deliberate but compelling, a feat of motion picture art which has never been equaled and one which itself will enthrall persons time and again.", "Whether committing petty crimes or proving his worth against a series of terrifying beasts... Fairbanks oozes preposterous, child-like charisma.", "A grinning, bare-chested Douglas Fairbanks shimmies up a rope and enters a room in the palace, intending to steal a casket of baubles. Instead, his eyes fall on Princess Julanne Johnston...
