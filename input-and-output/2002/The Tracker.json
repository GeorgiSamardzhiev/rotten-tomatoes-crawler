{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When a white woman is murdered in 1920s Australia, a police officer (Gary Sweet) ventures into the outback with a small crew in search of the aboriginal fugitive (Noel Wilton) accused of the crime. In his group are a newcomer to the country (Damon Gameau), an old sage (Grant Page) and an indigenous tracker (David Gulpilil) who is not fully trusted by the racially prejudiced officer. As the pursuit through this dangerous territory drags on, tensions begin to rise between the crew members.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Art House & International/Documentary/Drama/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Rolf de Heer", "studio": "VertigoProductionsPty.Ltd.", "theater_date": "Jan 16, 2004", "dvd_date": "Apr 17, 2020", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This is strong and uniquely Australian storytelling at its very best.", "", "strangely awkward in terms of film pacing", "[T]he film emphasizes its fable qualities and sets the stage for its moral structure, which hinges on the merging of power and racism and the possibility of resistance.", "[D]rags you across acres of despair, a harsh landscape of the angry, terrified side of human nature...", "A high-minded film that at times verges on didacticism, The Tracker is redeemed by its adherence to a simple yet distinctive approach to storytelling and its uniformly strong acting.", "De Heer doesn't want the violence to distract from the sadness and the substance of the movie's mythic history lesson. It's an inventive idea, one that probably doomed the movie's commercial prospects here in the States.", "An imposing film that tackles a serious theme with dignity and even audacity and that features production values of the highest quality.", "An engrossing study of race and history in Australia.", "The Tracker is the first significant movie to find its way into American theaters in 2005.", "Specially composed songs makes the study of men driven by primitive cruelty and ruthless justice something of a tone poem.", "Combines a classic movie-Western setting and narrative with a Heart of Darkness-like morality play.", "Interspersed with moments of great suspense, the tragic cat-and-mouse survival adventure overshadows the heavy-handed didacticism.", "See the film mainly for the quiet and powerful work of Gulpilil in the title role.", "Too often, The Tracker explains when it would be better to suggest.", "An obvious, hot-coal piece of politically correct agitprop.", "The Tracker is one of those rare films that deserves to be called haunting.", "The Tracker has the punch of a good Western with a clean and direct script plus an adventurous use of songs and folk paintings.", "Has the same cinematic grandeur that people admire about John Ford's classic 'The Searchers' without that film's racist reflexes.
