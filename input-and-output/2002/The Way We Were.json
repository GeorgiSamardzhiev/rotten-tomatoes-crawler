{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Opposites attract when, during their college days, Katie Morosky (Barbra Streisand), a politically active Jew, meets Hubbell Gardiner (Robert Redford), a feckless WASP. Years later, in the wake of World War II, they meet again and, despite their obvious differences, marry. Hubbell wants to be a screenwriter, so the two move to California despite Katie's objections. They prosper there, but as the Hollywood blacklist looms, Katie's activism threatens her husband's reputation.", "rating": "64", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 58m", "director": "Sydney Pollack", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...a slow-moving yet mostly compelling love story...", "The entire picture reeks of prophetic hindsight, whereby the cleverer characters so splendidly predict the future, thanks to the author's writing them years after the fact.", "While I could not really believe much of what I saw, my eyes never left the screen.", "For a screen romance with huge movie stars, that sentiment feels pretty real.", "Redford, as a character seemingly hewn from the pages of F Scott Fitzgerald (he's a writer to boot), is perfectly cast and Streisand is simply Streisand.", "Streisand is capable in an implausible role as a liberated Jewess, and Redford is...well, Redford.", "By, some peculiar alchemy, \"The Way We Were\" turns into the kind of compromised claptrap that Hubbell is supposed to be making within the film and that we're meant to think is a sellout. It is.", "The movie has the look of a big Hollywood romantic film but because director Pollack looks corruption in the face and exposes it for what it feels like, The Way We Were emerges as one of the least sentimental love stories ever filmed.", "Old-fashioned sudser.", "In Pollack's schmaltzy romantic melodrama, real politics is in the background (of course), but the movie is enjoyable as a star vehicle for its handsome stars, Redford and Streisand in their only film together, not to mention Hamlisch's melodic tone.", "The politics are relegated to the background, and what is left is a commercially astute weepie.", "An engrossing, if occasionally ludicrous, hit tearjerker with Pollack, Streisand, and Redford doing a good job of bringing Arthur Laurents' script to the screen.", "A distended, talky, redundant and moody melodrama.", "A for effort; C for execution.", "Sentimental but not overly smaltzy", "", "With the script glossing whole areas of confrontation (from the communist '30s to the McCarthy witch-hunts), it often passes into the haze of a nostalgic fashion parade.", "It's easy to forgive the movie a lot because of Streisand.
