(Martin Short) cripples much of the film's momentum and renders many of the latter scenes unwatchable (a friend once dubbed B.E.N. \"the Jar-Jar Binks of animation,\" and she was absolutely right).", "Given the amazing artwork, if a better character [than a cyborg John Silver] had been inserted, we'd be talking about \"Treasure Planet\" as another Disney classic.", "The awkward trappings of this Disney adventure mechanize and blunt the tale's humanity. It pops and squeaks and rumbles, but Treasure Planet lacks the strength to transport audiences.

Wyeth's illustrations for the 1911 Scribner's edition of Treasure Island as the inspiration for their marvelously detailed fantasy world.", "Swashbuckling, intergalactic fun.", "Inspired visuals and fluid animation, even blown up on IMAX, weren't enough to prevent me from being bored out of my skull.", "While Pixar can do no wrong with its cutting edge CGI originals, Disney is falling back on old formulas", "Hey mom, I went to another planet and found money for you to buy back the family farm. Sure, I blew up the planet in the process, but aren't you proud of me?", "There is almost no coherence to the plot points, leaving another technically sound but disposable product that awaits its straight-to-video sequel.", "Esta curiosa releitura do clssico de Robert Louis Stevenson conta com um visual impressionante e boas seqncias de ao. Ainda assim, est longe de se equiparar aos grandes clssicos da Disney.", "...just the sort of fast-paced adventure flick that today's kids aren't getting enough of.", "It's not one of Disney's greatest, but it's solid entertainment.", "The film's signature imagery is impressive and there are some good set-pieces."], "rating": ["", "", "C", "5/5", "2/4", "6/10", "2.5/4", "4/5", "4/10", "B+", "", "3/5", "2/4", "", "C-", "", "3/5", "3/4", "3/4", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Rachel Wagner", "Kevin Carr", "Matt Brunson", "James Plath", "Peter Canavese", "Nell Minow", "Tim Brayton", "Steven D.
