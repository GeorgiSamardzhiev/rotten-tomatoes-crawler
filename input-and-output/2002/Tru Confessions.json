{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When a local TV station launches a filmmaking contest, teenager Tru Walker (Clara Bryant) enters in a heartbeat. Her life seems full of drama to document -- including a surgeon father who's never there and a mother, Ginny (Mare Winningham), who seems as if she isn't there even when she is. In the end, Tru chooses to make a film about her mentally impaired twin brother, Eddie (Shia LaBeouf). But as airtime nears, Tru fears how others will react to her rather personal story.", "rating": "84", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Kids & Family/Television", "runtime": "1h 23m", "director": "Paul Hoen", "studio": "Miramax", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 21, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Family drama veers between irritating and heart-wrenching.", "[H]idden among the dross are beautifully accurate glimpses of life in a family with a disabled child, made possible by a remarkable performance from a young actor named Shia LaBeouf."], "rating": ["2/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tracey Petherick", "Neil Genzlinger"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times"], "date": ["April 23, 2020", "September 11, 2019"]}}
