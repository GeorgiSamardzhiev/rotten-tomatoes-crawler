It's a unique kind of war story that may not win the war, but has no trouble winning over the audience.", "The mission, which the soldiers codenamed Operation Mad Dog, would have been delicious as a documentary, but director John Henderson goes for an antic Two Stooges Abroad approach.", "Far from an anti-war film, Two Men is more in line with In Which We Serve (1942) than Oh!
