As Lucy's time at the firm nears an end, she grows jealous of June and has second thoughts about leaving George.", "rating": "42", "genre": "Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Marc Lawrence", "studio": "CastleRockEntertainment,VillageRoadshowProd.", "theater_date": "Dec 20, 2002", "dvd_date": "Jul 16, 2011", "box_office": "$93.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Life, love and romance.
