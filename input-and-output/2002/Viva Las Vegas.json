{"metadata": {"synopsis": "All musically gifted race-driver Lucky Jackson (Elvis Presley) wants in Las Vegas is to score enough money for a new car motor so he can win the Grand Prix. When he encounters sexy swimming instructor Rusty (Ann-Margret), he considers staying around longer. After Lucky loses his winnings in the hotel pool, he's forced to remain in Vegas long enough to win back his dough -- but now he also wants to win the Rusty's heart. Unfortunately, so does his slick racing enemy, Elmo (Cesare Danova).", "rating": "86", "genre": "Classics/Musical & Performing Arts/Romance", "runtime": "1h 26m", "director": "George Sidney", "studio": "MetroGoldwynMayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 14, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Don't tell Ann-Margret that this is supposed to be an Elvis Presley movie...", "Justly celebrated as the rare Elvis movie in which Presley is not just complemented but also challenged by a song-and-dance co-star of comparable sexual energy and anatomical expressiveness.", "Surely, it's Elvis' vehicle, but the movie really belongs to Ann-Margret.", "Typical entertaining but lightweight and vulgar Elvis vehicle.", "It's not magic, this movie, but it is alchemy of a kind...", "Vegas ad is a nonstop song-and-dance delight.", "Presley's one really good musical, mainly because it features a female costar, Ann-Margret, who can match the coiffed one in the charisma stakes.", "The sizzling combination of Elvis Presley and Ann-Margaret is enough to carry Viva Las Vegas over the top.", "Vulgar, spirited, and neglected director George Sidney meets his match with this 1964 Elvis Presley vehicle.", "It's all color and glamor and sexy fun.", "One of Elvis Presley's best films, Viva Las Vegas benefits from the exuberant direction of MGM vet George Sidney, the young and sexy Ann-Margret as romantic interest, and over 12 melodic songs that take up half of the running time (only 85 minutes).", "...a cut above most of Elvis's movies, but, unfortunately, it still comes off as little more than an upscale nightclub revue.", "Directed by George Sidney, it has a carefree spirit as opposed to the carelessness of the other films, and for once Elvis is paired with a worthy co-star.", "Thin even by Presley standards.", "", "Coming on a balmy day, with no pretensions of art, Viva Las Vegas, the new Elvia Presley vehicle, is about as pleasant and unimportant as a banana split.
