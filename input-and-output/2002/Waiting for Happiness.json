{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Before immigrating to the West, Abdallah (Mohamed Mahmoud Ould Mohamed) travels to the coastal city of Nouadhibou, Mauritania, to visit his mother. Although he grew up there, Abdallah feels anything but at home in his old neighborhood: He can no longer speak the local dialect, and he wears western clothes that immediately cast him as an outsider. But, as Abdallah spends time with a young boy and an elderly electrician, he can't help but feel a sense of loss for the life he's abandoning.", "rating": "76", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Abderrahmane Sissako", "studio": "", "theater_date": "Apr 4, 2003", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$2.0K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Strikingly beautiful visual mood piece that resembles in many ways the refreshing intensity of an Ozu family drama.", "pretty and it's exotic, but that's all it is.", "", "", "A skilfully shot film, with startling images and a gentle pace that frequently comes to a full stop just to capture the rhythms of life in an earthbound purgatory.", "A moving picture that does not move.", "Sublime.", "The title perfectly captures the mood of this striking film.", "Manages to delight without much of a story.", "Though talk in the film often turns to death, Khatra's enthusiasm and love of life keep the movie surprisingly upbeat.", "Sissako's slender narrative takes its time reaching its ambiguous conclusion.", "A film that will be best appreciated by those willing to endure its extremely languorous rhythms, Waiting for Happiness is ultimately thoughtful without having much dramatic impact.", "Once the audience figure out what's being said, the filmmaker's relative passivity will make it tough for them to really care.", "A spellbinding African film about the modern condition of rootlessness, a state experienced by millions around the globe.", "Takes you by the face, strokes your cheeks and coos beseechingly at you: slow down, shake off your tensions and take this picture at its own breezy, distracted rhythms.", "The beautiful, unusual music is this film's chief draw, but its dreaminess may lull you to sleep.", "Abderrahmane Sissako's Heremakono (Waiting for Happiness) is an elegiac portrait of a transit city on the West African coast struggling against foreign influences."], "rating": ["A", "3.5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "3.5/5", "1.5/4", "", "3.5/5", "3/4", "3/4", "6/10", "", "2/4", "", "4/5", "2.5/5", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Dennis Schwartz", "Don Willmott", "", "Jamie Russell", "Rich Cline", "Jeffrey M.
