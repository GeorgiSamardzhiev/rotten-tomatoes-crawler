{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Based upon the best-selling book \"We Were Soldiers Once ... and Young\" by Lt. Gen. Harold G. Moore (Ret.) and journalist Joseph L. Galloway, this compelling war drama depicts the true story of the first major battle between the United States and North Vietnamese forces. It is a film about uncommon valor and nobility under fire, loyalty among soldiers, and the heroism and sacrifice of men and women both home and abroad.", "rating": "63", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 17m", "director": "Randall Wallace", "studio": "IconEntertainmentInternational,Wheelhouse", "theater_date": "Mar 1, 2002", "dvd_date": "Jun 6, 2014", "box_office": "$78.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["As Lt.

A fitting tribute to all the men and women who have fought and died for their country -- and for each other.", "Gibson wears a rictus of distaste which seems more suggestive of dodgy on-set catering than the horrors of combat.", "Mais uma patriotada que mostra os americanos matando milhares de vietcongues, mas sendo mais 'humanos' que os inimigos.", "", "Ultimately, it staggers out bloodied, partially bowed, but at least not totally beaten.", "...A gripping, fast-moving film that will be added to the short list of quality movies focused on the U.S. conflict in Vietnam.", "Almost always competent, but never brilliant. Its textbook approach to moviemaking is so common in Hollywood war films that it can't be called new or enlightening.", "", "I didn't mind the film's sentimental view of GIs. It's stuff like this that gets me crying, especially in times of combat like now. I wasn't the only one wiping tears away. It's hard not to when you're proud to be an American.", "This is a good film; strong, honest, strikingly photographed (by Dean Semler) and appropriately devastating.", "Mel Gibson's Vietnam drama breaks under the weight of its contradictions.", ""], "rating": ["", "3/5", "", "B-", "3.5/5", "4/5", "C", "3.5/5", "3.5/4", "", "3/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "6/10", "C+", "", "4/5", "1/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Debbie Lynn Elias", "Nell Minow", "David Ansen", "Emanuel Levy", "", "", "Jeffrey Overstreet", "", "Greg Maki", "Tim Robey", "Pablo Villa\u00e7a", "Andrea Chase", "Tom Grealis", "John R.
