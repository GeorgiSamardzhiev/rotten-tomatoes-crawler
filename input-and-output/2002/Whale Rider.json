{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Only males are allowed to ascend to chiefdom in a Maori tribe in New Zealand. This ancient custom is upset when the child selected to be the next chief dies at birth. However his twin sister, Pai (Keisha Castle-Hughes), survives. At age 12, she enlists the help of her grandmother (Vicky Haughton) and the training of her uncle (Grant Roa) to claim her birthright. But to break with convention, she'll have to do the impossible: win over her ultra-traditional grandfather (Rawiri Paratene).", "rating": "91", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Niki Caro", "studio": "ApolloMedia,SouthPacificPictures,Pandora", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 31, 2016", "box_office": "$20.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["[A] heartfelt drama about gender, culture and generational clashes.", "I get a pleasant surprise observing its tale of inclusion, ancestral traditions and family wounds. [Full review in Spanish]", "It's refreshing to see a film so intent on showing the love and sorrow that comes from interaction between family members. I also enjoyed seeing a film that opened up a world with distinctly different cultures and beliefs.", "Filmmaker-writer Caro orchestrates scenes with a lyrical touch, infusing the film with doses of humor, and an effortless, mythic quality consistent with its source material, the eponymous cultural novel by Maori author Witi Ihimaera.", "[Lisa] Gerrard's ethereal vocal style combined with electronic flourishes make for an unusual soundtrack, but one that meshes with the film's bracing mixture of mysticism and realism set against the strange and beautiful New Zealand landscape.", "Whale Rider will endure as a modern masterwork because its themes are as universal as the story is localized.", "Castle-Hughes' performance is so amazing and she plays off of the veteran Maori actors so well it's hard to believe she was plucked from her classroom when a film crew came by looking for a non-actor....", "both an effective snapshot of the challenges which modernity brings to indigenous cultures, and a neat illustration of the power of myths to adapt.", "Excellent to watch and discuss as a family.", "This is what a children's film should be like.", "The movie's story is a sometimes clumsy but gradually involving coming-of-age story about courage, sexism, past customs vs. contemporary social values and a community and family at odds within themselves.", "Newcomer Castle-Hughes' unaffected, confident turn makes it credible our heroine might retain her determination and self-worth despite serial setbacks.", "The third act -- where all our predictions come true -- has a quiet dignity and, although it moves from A to B as expected, how it gets there is surprisingly mysterious.", "", "The filmmaker knows how to seduce an audience without making it feel had. When a movie's this likable, it would take a very tough crowd not to be pleased.", "Niki Caro roots her characters in a landscape equal parts mundane and boundless, incorporates tantalising sea photography and Lisa's Gerrard's ambient soundtrack, and lifts off into a sublime, Elysian ending.", "\"Whale Rider\" is a mystical, gentle movie that goes beyond the boundaries of the usual coming-of-age film.", "I can honestly say that there is not a single plot point or character arc depicted here that I have not seen a thousand times before.", "...an uncommonly intelligent, well-crafted movie that -- despite the curious PG-13 rating -- parents shouldn't hesitate to see with their kids.", "The climactic revelation, when it comes, is something so ambitious that I never would have dreamed it would work convincingly.
