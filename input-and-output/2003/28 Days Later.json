{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A group of misguided animal rights activists free a caged chimp infected with the \"Rage\" virus from a medical research lab. When London bike courier Jim (Cillian Murphy) wakes up from a coma a month after, he finds his city all but deserted. On the run from the zombie-like victims of the Rage, Jim stumbles upon a group of survivors, including Selena (Naomie Harris) and cab driver Frank (Brendan Gleeson), and joins them on a perilous journey to what he hopes will be safety.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Horror/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 52m", "director": "Danny Boyle", "studio": "FoxSearchlight,FilmCouncil,DNAPicturesInternational", "theater_date": "Jun 27, 2003", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$45.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A few ideas are borrowed from George A. Romero, but the brunt of the visuals and story are original and thrilling, though also a touch artsy and marginally poetic.", "A truly innovative and disturbing horror fantasy about a modern-day England totally ravaged by plague.", "A perfect fusion of lo-fi but gorgeous camerawork, a searing soundtrack and pitch-perfect performances... the film demonstrates how something tender and intimate can also be terrifying and epic.", "Twenty-eight Days Later is a zombie flick, which makes it my kind of movie-dare I say, our kind of movie. No cinema zombie ever shambles into view without its agenda.", "[G]ritty and truly frightening.", "28 Days Later was thrilling for the time.", "28 Days Later unfolds as agripping suspense film punctuated by gruesome violence.", "It really touched on something that nobody had ever tackled before and did it in such a modern way... I was really impressed.", "The possibility of renewal suggested by the survivors' attempts to start over certainly points toward hope. However, the circularity of the movie's plot is most likely to inspire dismay.", "The best purely British horror/science-fiction film in decades. And the first great apocalypse movie of the new millennium.", "Boyle is perfect for the job because he's not big on reassurance; by taking the radical step of letting the movie's low-budget grime get under your skin, he gives the zombie picture new life.", "It's an efficient reminder that science-fiction filmmaking doesn't necessarily have to be swamped by special effects, that the best of it comes in tweaking the familiar just enough to turn it fantastical.", "The movie's craft makes the dread of a killer virus contagious: viewers may feel they have come down with a case of secondhand SARS or sympathetic monkeypox.", "The end result still lacks a coherent sense of what the film is trying to achieve.", "Heedlessly derivative though it may be, 28 Days Later does what it sets out to do and then some -- scare us out of our wits, then get us to apply those wits to an uncommonly intelligent and provocative zombie flick.", "Later does a lot of things right, which makes its third-act missteps even more frustrating.", "28 Days Later is a mind-bending look at a future one hopes never happens.", "This Dogme-driven apocalyptic nightmare from director Danny Boyle is a tense, exciting and terrifying horror.", "The picture is twitchy and annoying, flecked with blood and half-digested ideas, and too much is left unexplained.", "A crude but sometimes startling serving of schlock, the velocity and ferocity compensating for leaden conversation and smudge-o-vision photography."], "rating": ["8/10", "4/5", "1", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Leigh Paatsch", "Alex Saveliev", "Joshua Rothkopf", "Mark H.
