{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After his wife leaves him and his apartment turns into a pigsty, Jacques (Jean-Pierre Bacri) decides to get a housekeeper. He meets Laura (\u00c9milie Dequenne), who's young and pretty. She has no experience, but he hires her. As time passes, Laura does more than just mop the floors -- she gradually begins to insinuate herself into his life. Soon their relationship threatens to go beyond that between an employer and his employee.
