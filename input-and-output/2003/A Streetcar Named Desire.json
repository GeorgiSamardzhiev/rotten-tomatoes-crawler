{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Based on the play by Tennessee Williams, this renowned drama follows troubled former schoolteacher Blanche DuBois (Vivien Leigh) as she leaves small-town Mississippi and moves in with her sister, Stella Kowalski (Kim Hunter), and her husband, Stanley (Marlon Brando), in New Orleans. Blanche's flirtatious Southern-belle presence causes problems for Stella and Stanley, who already have a volatile relationship, leading to even greater conflict in the Kowalski household.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h 2m", "director": "Elia Kazan", "studio": "WarnerBrothers", "theater_date": "Jan 1, 1951", "dvd_date": "Oct 2, 2013", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["By the end of this Elia Kazan production, the revelations aren't shocking or memorable or morbidly palatable; in many ways, they're just depressing.", "Elia Kazan's claustrophobic close-ups do a fine job of recreating the intensity of the stage.", "Even taking this performance alone, Brando's work deserves to be known as an abiding cinematic performance. Amongst cowardly and callous acts, there still rests a level of pathos to the character.", "Vivien Leigh's virtuoso portrayal was the year's finest acting...in the same picture Marlon Brando gives a brilliant and appalling performance as a primeval brute.", "Some movie goers will be bored by its unlovely subject and wealth of talk, but others will admire it as an excursion into art.", "Also screened was A Streetcar Named Desire, revamped with the four additional minutes that were excised years ago by censors. It was being paraded about as if a half-hour had been added. So now Stella walks down the steps sultrily.", "Vivien Leigh gives one of those rare performances that can truly be said to evoke pity and terror.", "The fact it was the fifth most lucrative film in its year of release is a depressing sign of how we have infantilized ourselves as spectators. [Full review in Portuguese.]", "Seeing the film reminds us instantly of our perennial desire to be swept up into a compelling story.", "Tennessee Williams filled the tinderbox. Marlon Brando ignited it.", "... a Hollywood landmark, both for pushing the envelope of subject matter allowed on screen by the censors and for showcasing the more naturalistic \"method\" approach to performance ...", "An unqualified masterpiece.", "Epic performances in a movie that seethes with atmosphere.", "Starring Brando and Vivien Leigh, Kazan's screen version of Williams' masterpiece is the best film made out of the playwright's theaterical work.", "\"Stella!\" classic is powerful tale of abuse, alcoholism.", "Has a permanent place amongst the classics, not only for the performances but for Tennessee Williams' raw writing about people raw with pain, fear, longing and complicated feelings", "The blistering sexual repression is the entire point of the 1950s. Quite simply, fabulous.", "The film is perhaps best regarded as an intelligent and engaged recreation of the original Broadway experience, in which Jessica Tandy first played the role. There's no denying the awful horror and pity of the final scene.", "it's a close-to-definitive example of how to make a great play work on film, for all the very slight air of Hollywood compromise.", "Simply a masterful adap of Tennessee Williams' sultry, searing play and an affirmation of Marlon Brando's acting genius."], "rating": ["6/10", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "9/10", "", "5/5", "4/4", "3.5/4", "", "4/4", "5/5", "A", "4/5", "", "", "3/5", "", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Ed Potton", "Alasdair Bayman", "Clyde Gilmour", "Bob Thomas", "Brandon Judell", "Pauline Kael", "Pablo Villa\u00e7a", "David Keyes", "Josh Larsen", "Sean Axmaker", "Matt Brunson", "Kim Newman", "Emanuel Levy", "Charles Cassady", "Andrew L.
