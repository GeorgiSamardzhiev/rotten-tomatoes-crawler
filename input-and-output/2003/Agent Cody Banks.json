{"metadata": {"synopsis": "High-school student Cody Banks (Frankie Muniz) wants nothing more than what every other teen wants: to survive the banality of adolescence and become an adult. But Banks is no ordinary teen; he's a CIA agent. And, when he's not doing his homework, Banks is on the case, spying on fellow student Natalie Connors (Hilary Duff) in order to get close to her father (Martin Donovan), a scientist who has invented killer nanobots designed to bring down the country.", "rating": "38", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Kids & Family/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Harald Zwart", "studio": "SplendidPictures,MaverickFilms", "theater_date": "Mar 14, 2003", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$47.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["I have a feeling Muniz could have done much more with this role under the right director and with a better script.", "The Bond films never feel dated, and neither does Agent Cody Banks.
