The equally problematic Alexandra's Project is simply glib.", "Even though the performances are terrific and the claustrophobic atmospherics effective, the film elicits more anger than praise.", "It's really the feel-bad movie of the week. In a genius sort of way.", "It's a movie that will leave few men unrattled and many women vicariously satisfied.", "Buday is coolly persuasive in the seesaw role of an unbalanced housewife who jerks from despair to anger.", "This low-budget Australian film is pitched as a psycho-sexual thriller but it's not thrilling at all: it's just cold, hateful and cheap.", "An edgy little Aussie thriller that will have husbands shaking in their shoes, Alexandra's Project is a film like no other.", "One of the year's true surprise packages..will have you gasping for breath right up until the very last cinematic shock", "That damn videotape takes the edge off the mood both visually and dramatically.", "A tense and dramatic psycho-thriller that mostly takes place in a single day, Alexandra's Project is a dense and confronting film that savagely explores the notions of sex within a marriage."], "rating": ["4/10", "A-", "C-", "1/4", "C+", "3/4", "4.5/5", "1/4", "4/5", "1.5/4", "", "3.5/5", "3/5", "3/4", "1/5", "4/5", "4/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Vandeuren", "Jason Gorber", "John A.
