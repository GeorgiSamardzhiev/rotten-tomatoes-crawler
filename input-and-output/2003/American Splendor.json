{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Underground comic book writer Harvey Pekar, portrayed by Paul Giamatti but also appearing as himself, is the subject of this inventive biopic. Much of the film focuses on the eccentric Pekar's day-to-day life in Cleveland, particularly his relationship with his patient wife, Joyce Brabner (played by Hope Davis and also appearing as herself). As Pekar's musings are brought to the screen in this unique and engaging production, the movie playfully incorporates comic book-like panels.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Shari Springer Berman, Robert Pulcini", "studio": "GoodMachine,HBOFilms", "theater_date": "Aug 15, 2003", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$6.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Played to perfection by Paul Giamatti, Pekar defies the categories of hero, villain, or even anti-hero. He simply exists, an ordinary man trying to make the best of a largely disappointing life.", "What makes the film special throughout is the way its form mirrors its subject matter. On every level, it's a film about unlikely marriages.", "Like Ghost World before it, Pulcini and Berman have taken an unconventional comic and given it a cinematic make-over.", "I can't imagine how the filmmakers went about it, let alone pulled the whole thing off, but their film comes together in unpredictable and remarkably pleasurable ways.", "Underneath all this schtick pulses a restrained, pensive take on how the terrific loneliness of the modern human condition can be ameliorated through its narration. Misery loves company, in other words, especially if it's comically described.", "Channels Pekar's vision of art and life as twinned struggles. One of cinema's great first-date sequences is here. We're splendidly shown how a lower-class nine-to-fiver has his own creative selves and richly expressive life.", "Earthy, gritty and real; for older kids.", "Shari Springer Berman and Robert Pulcini's biopic about Harvey Pekar - who injected schadenfreude into the superhero-comics world - wonderfully etches one man's exploration of using misery as a creative outlet and, eventually, a critical coping mechanism.", "The rare artist biopic that goes beyond the dull march of events and actually illuminates the creative process.", "The film gives a charming, funny, and many times engrossing account of Pekar which will surely please fans and garner some new ones and I liked it a lot.", "American Splendor is certainly one of the most complete, satisfying and entertaining hybrid of documentary and dramatisation, as well as of live action and 2D animation/comic stills.", "Un film assez lent, mais au r\u00e9cit tout de m\u00eame fort bien construit", "A glorious rebuke to all this summer's recycled, effects-ridden, laboriously \"fun\" Hollywood disappointments piled along the wayside like so many crashed cars.", "A life affirming experience, perhaps even a life changing one.", "The movie is as unclassifiable as the comic -- neither documentary nor biopic, or maybe both.", "Mr. Giamatti and Ms. Davis seem to feed off each other, bringing out the best performances we've seen from these actors.", "We're constantly kept on our toes regarding issues of representation while Pekar's sour but indefatigible working-class skepticism carries us along.", "If you can get through the confusing goings-on of the first reel, then this is a satisfying experience -- funny, touching and tragic by turns. And Giamatti deserves every award going.", "Hugely enjoyable and very clever portrait of Harvey Pekar.", "The blend of styles results in an edgy, touching, original story about a working-class man who channels his gloom, grime and longing into comic art"], "rating": ["3.5/5", "", "A-", "", "", "", "5/5", "4/4", "", "3/4", "", "8/10", "", "5/5", "5/5", "4/4", "", "4/5", "", "A"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Monica Reid", "Amy Taubin", "Glenn Dunks", "Joe Morgenstern", "Lisa Rosman", "Brian Gibson", "Nell Minow", "Nick Rogers", "Scott Tobias", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Urban Cinefile Critics", "Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Vandeuren", "David Ansen", "Keith H.
