{"metadata": {"synopsis": "John J. (Robert Duvall) is a seasoned hit man sent on a job to Argentina. When the general he's sent to kill delays his return to the country, John passes the time with Manuela (Luciana Pedraza), a beautiful dancer who becomes his teacher and guide into Argentina's sensual world of the tango. Spellbound by the rich and mysterious world Manuela has shown him, his idyll is shattered when the reality of why he's there comes crashing down around him.", "rating": "47", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "Robert Duvall", "studio": "AmericanZoetrope", "theater_date": "Mar 28, 2003", "dvd_date": "Mar 20, 2017", "box_office": "$970.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["He's an old assassin, she's a young local dancing hottie, and they mix dance, lust and guns.", "", "It is a form of condescension that Duvall could only perpetrate while being blinded by true love.", "O ritmo  lento, falta foco  narrao e o ato final  confuso. Por sorte, este no  um filme sobre \"tramas\", mas sobre personagens - e  a que merece elogios.", "It's slow, but it's also sure-footed. Duvall takes it at his own damn pace, and his grouchy old man of a contract killer is a well-rounded and wholly believable personage.", "More a song about living and dying well than a picture that makes much sense in the traditional definition.", "I loved this film for what it didn't try to do.", "This is the type of stand-up-and-take-notice performance that burgeoning actors dream off, yet Pedraza is so effortless in her portrayal that I started to think she almost didn't have to try to be so wondrously beguiling.", "Assassination Tango runs aground with an accumulation of small illogicalities.", "Turgid and self-indulgent...haphazardly constructed and featuring dialogue that sounds poorly improvised--as well as a central character who's less a human being than a collection of cliches.", "Are there 72 year-old hit men?", "...it would be a mistake to dismiss Duvall's career behind the camera as a rich character actor's hobby.", "If Duvall wanted to celebrate his hobby, he should have made a documentary.", "You get the feeling Duvall took a tango trip to Buenos Aires and haphazardly decided to make a crime movie while staying there.", "It's a curious and unsatisfying lark, in which Robert Duvall the actor is rendered speechless by Robert Duvall the writer and sideswiped by Robert Duvall the director.", "While Duvall's contribution to the tango canon may not add much to its mystique, it still offers considerable pleasures to anyone who shares his interest.", "Not so much a movie as a chance to sidle up alongside Robert Duvall and twirl around a cinematic dance floor with him.", "Its many tiny character details make up for the ludicrous story it's telling.", "A film that uses tango as a metaphor for life ought to generate some fire. But Assassination Tango offers little heat.", "One of the most boring films in recent memory.
