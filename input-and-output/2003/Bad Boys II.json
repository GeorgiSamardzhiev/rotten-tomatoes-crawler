{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The drug ecstasy is flowing into Miami, and the police want it stopped. Police Detective Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) and his partner, Mike Lowrey (Will Smith), are just the men to do it. They track the drugs to a Cuban smuggler, Johnny Tapia (Jordi Moll\u00e0), who is also involved in a bloody war with Russian and Haitian mobsters. If that isn't bad enough, there's tension between the two cops because Lowrey is romantically involved with Burnett's sister, Syd (Gabrielle Union).", "rating": "23", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 26m", "director": "Michael Bay", "studio": "Columbia", "theater_date": "Jul 18, 2003", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$138.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There is some fun to be had in the outrageous mayhem, particularly with yet more chase sequences (repetitious as they may be).", "A monument to excess both exhausting and entertaining, Bad Boys II challenges audiences to withstand 2.5 hours of stamina-sapping \"Bayhem,\" but benefits from the heightened, almost surreal vulgarity at its core.", "Perhaps it's the chemistry between its two leads, or perhaps it's the way director Michael Bay pounds action sequence after action sequence. One things for sure: The film proves, ultimately, to be a perfect example of mindless summer escapism.", "An unpleasant, mean movie all the way.", "I love Will Smith. And this is the first film this summer to pass the Joel Siegel sequel test: If this had been the first one would you want to see a sequel of it? Yeah. Although shorter.", "Well, at least Bad Boys II was better than Pearl Harbor.", "Like our two loose cannons with badges, the movie misses its target at least as often as it hits it. Along the way, as well, it will likely batter a few brain cells into a premature grave.", "The producer Jerry Bruckheimer and the director Michael Bay's buddy-cop destructorama has all the editing beats of a sex film.", "Producer Bruckheimer and director Bay have sunk to a new low for irresponsible, inhuman violence, dragging Will Smith and Martin Lawrence along for a ghastly, deafening display of bloodshed.", "You can&#146;t fault it for pure action, I s&#146;pose, but it left me feeling cold.", "By the last-reel showdown in Cuba, your senses have been carpet-bombed past repair, and the overlength of the thing leaves you moaning for mercy.", "Clever ideas and hilarious moments drown in a flood of violence and profanity.", "Bad Boys II is the rare case in which escapism involves leaving the theater.", "It's only when Bay turns serious in the final 20 minutes that the movie founders, and then sinks, under the weight of his Pearl Harbor-type pretentiousness.", "By the end, you're past caring who kills whom and just want to escape from this smug, sadistic nonsense.", "Despite the energetic efforts of Smith and Lawrence, Boys is yet another hyperventilating sequel with an inflated plot and running time.", "The action is what makes the movie. Smith and Lawrence's witty comebacks and petty quarrels are still funny though they'll never be as fresh.", "Like the first film, this is basically a generic buddy cop movie and an episode of Miami Vice fused together, towing a trunk of old boring ideas and pointless camera tricks.", "Overlong, overblown and underwritten it may be, but Bad Boys II still punches the pleasure centres enough to qualify as big, dumb fun.
