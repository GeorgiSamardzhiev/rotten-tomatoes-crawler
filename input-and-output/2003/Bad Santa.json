{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this dark comedy, the crotchety Willie T. Stokes (Billy Bob Thornton) and his partner (Tony Cox) reunite once a year for a holiday con. Posing as a mall Santa and his elf, they rip off shopping outlets on Christmas Eve. This year, however, Willie is falling apart. He's depressed and alcoholic, and his erratic behavior draws the suspicion of mall security (Bernie Mac). But when befriending a small boy brings out his kinder side, Willie begins to wonder if there is still some hope for him.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Terry Zwigoff", "studio": "DimensionFilms,TriptychPictures,TheKLLine", "theater_date": "Nov 26, 2003", "dvd_date": "Apr 21, 2016", "box_office": "$60.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["His journey of humanization (or the softening of a terribly hardened heart) is sometimes genuinely poignant, even when it's surrounded by preposterously reprehensible conduct.", "Lauren Graham was wonderful as the sweet, at times horny, bartender with a thing for Santa.", "This tale of a misanthrope and a bullied boy is grossly funny yet rather affecting. Willie may not win Dad Of The Year but increasingly has the kid's interests at heart, and after drunkenly eating the advent calendar chocolates does at least feel guilty.", "The movie's one joke -- which will endure for the ages -- is the defamation of the Christmas spirit by Billy Bob Thornton, who stars as a drunken, chain-smoking, dirty-minded, incontinent, foul-mouthed and larcenous department-store Santa.", "if you hate the Yuletide season, you're part of the target audience", "Thornton never backs down from anything the writers throw at him. Bad Santa takes everything beyond tasteful limits.", "In the annals of movie profanity, this movie would rate an Oscar, but it's actually pretty sweet at heart, although never sentimental. And if you don't believe me, you know what you can do.", "An antidote to forced holiday cheer, this scabrously funny misanthropic comedy is not for the whole family.", "A breath of fresh air.", "If Bad Santa does well at the box office, Zwigoff will get credit for being a savvy player. That Bad Santa is as vile and stupid as Ghost World was insightful and touching is something Hollywood has no interest in measuring.", "You'd better watch out, you'd better not cry, and you'd better not take the kiddies to see this wickedly adult vision of a boozing, whoring, swearing department-store Santa Claus.", "Bad Santa stays cheerfully acerbic right to the end, and so the film s glacial warming and glimpses of heart take on even more of an unmistakable glow, standing out against all that darkness.", "This is really a one joke movie -- but that single gag is delivered with such caustic rancour by director Zwigoff that it achieves sublime heights of comedy.", "Bad Santa is definitely not PC, it's rude and crude and, I think, very funny.", "A lot of people will get a lot of perverse fun out of this.", "It might just make a few hardhearted cynics feel a warm fuzzy for the holidays.", "It's a movie that ages well. I suspect that Bad Santa, after playing profitably at the box office through the holidays, is fated for a long life as an out-of-nowhere cult hit, perhaps along the lines of Office Space.", "Once the rude shock of a profane Claus wears off, there's not really much to do except await the next outrageous remark.", "Even when the film threatens to turn feel-good, it thankfully resists the urge.", "With all the hype about this film, one may expect a dark, cynical comedy with some sort of commentary on the mass consumerism of the season. Sadly, moments like that are few."], "rating": ["8/10", "3.0/4", "4/5", "", "2/5", "A-", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "5/5", "", "4.5/5", "3.5/5", "3/5", "", "", "", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Sarah Cartland", "Stuart Klawans", "Kevin Carr", "Steve Persall", "Paul Byrnes", "David Ansen", "Mike Goodridge", "Sam Adams", "Dennis King", "Christopher Borrelli", "Jamie Russell", "David Stratton", "Margaret Pomeranz", "Dani Haski", "Matt Soergel", "Michael Agger", "Christy Lemire", "Adam Weiskind"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Caution Spoilers", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Nation", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fat Guys at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tampa Bay Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sydney Morning Herald", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia City Paper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Toledo Blade", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">At the Movies (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">At the Movies (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MovieFIX", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Florida Times-Union", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor"], "date": ["September 25, 2020", "September 2, 2020", "December 6, 2018", "February 24, 2016", "January 12, 2016", "November 23, 2015", "December 14, 2014", "December 14, 2014", "December 14, 2014", "December 14, 2014", "December 14, 2014", "December 14, 2014", "December 14, 2014", "December 14, 2014", "December 14, 2014", "December 14, 2014", "December 14, 2014", "December 5, 2013", "December 5, 2013", "December 5, 2013"]}}
