She teams up with the Penguin and Shreck to destroy Batman, but sparks fly unexpectedly when she confronts the caped crusader.", "rating": "80", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 6m", "director": "Tim Burton", "studio": "WarnerBrothers", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 31, 2013", "box_office": "$160.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Why isn't this movie called Catwoman?", "Both Catwoman and the Penguin are unique, formidable, brilliantly costumed, and perfectly ghoulish.", "Tim Burton's Batman Returns is a masterpiece, and the tour de force performances from the trio of Michael Keaton, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Danny DeVito are nothing short of iconic.", "[Batman Returns] is a blood-red wine that has only gotten better with age.", "...my biggest criticism of Batman Returns: its overstuffed narrative. Whether you see Catwoman as a villain or an antiheroine, there's a lot of moving parts in this movie and sometimes it seems like no one gets quite the attention that they deserve", "None have captured the feeling of Bruce Wayne's duality more, in my opinion, than Tim Burton's BATMAN RETURNS.", "Batman Returns doesn't quite outdo its predecessor even though the film has perfect casting with Danny DeVito as the Penguin.", "The film is unbelievably kitsch, and to those who associate Batman's camp period as starting with Schumacher, you really need to look at this film again.", "A strange beast.", "The Penguin running for office plotline is a snoozefest.", "A perfect Christmas movie for people who hate the holidays, and exactly the kind of film that modern studio executives are paid a small fortune to make sure you will never see the likes of again.", "There's unquestionable artistry in the mad world [Tim] Burton brought to life and the confidence with which he dropped it right smack into the middle of what should have been mainstream family entertainment.", "Routine car chases and explosions do not make a mildly dull film exciting.", "The strange, ambitious character work that comprises Batman Returns is wrapped in the perfunctory framework of a Tim Burton superhero film.", "...embraces the weirdness of the saga without a hint of hesitation.", "There are flashes of commercially oriented action and humor, but the overall feeling is one of a languid depression sprung straight from the heart of its author.", "[Burton's] dark, melancholy vision is undeniably something to see, but it is a claustrophobic conception, not an expansive one, oppressive rather than exhilarating, and it strangles almost all the enjoyment out of this movie without half trying.", "Director Tim Burton, apparently given a free hand to create a follow-up to the hugely successful 1989 Batman, marshals all his forces to create an elaborately melancholy ode to alienation.", "Among the 1990s' most fruitful marriages of high-brow auteurist style and pulp source material. A Burtonesque layer cake: at bottom, his take on German Expressionism; then the Gotham grotesquerie; topping it all off is a fissuring, fracturing fairytale.", "Batman Returns, though, is full of grim, Dostoyevskian undertones, not to mention a multitude of bloody, violent scenes."], "rating": ["", "6/10", "5/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "3/5", "2/5", "C-", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "3/4", "", "4/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Stephanie Rosenfeld", "Mike Massie", "Josh Wilding", "Drew Dietsch", "Joe Lipsett", "Sarah Musnicky", "Danielle Solzman", "PJ Nabarro", "Peter Bradshaw", "Rachel Wagner", "Sean Burns", "Zaki Hasan", "Mark Amory", "Justin Clark", "Josh Larsen", "Dave Kehr", "Kenneth Turan", "Dennis King", "Brian Gibson", "Ralph Novak"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bitch Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ComicBookMovie.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">FANDOM", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bloody Disgusting", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Nightmarish Conjurings", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Solzy at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The ARTery", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fandor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slant Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Alberta)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine"], "date": ["December 17, 2020", "September 9, 2020", "June 28, 2020", "June 27, 2020", "February 22, 2020", "September 30, 2019", "June 7, 2019", "May 28, 2019", "May 17, 2019", "April 15, 2019", "December 25, 2018", "October 31, 2018", "August 30, 2018", "June 19, 2017", "July 31, 2016", "December 14, 2014", "December 14, 2014", "December 14, 2014", "December 27, 2013", "December 3, 2013"]}}
