{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Song Jinming (Qiang Li) and Tang Zhaoyang (Wang Shuangbao) work for low wages in rural China's desolate and claustrophobic mines. They've concocted a scheme to make extra money, though: They pretend a fellow employee is their family member, murder him, then pass the death off as an accident and run away with the settlement. Their next target is green teenage boy Yuan Fengming (Wang Baoqiang), who is eager to tag along. However, Song becomes close with Yuan, and the operation is jeopardized.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Yang Li", "studio": "TagSpledourandFilmsLimited", "theater_date": "Mar 6, 2004", "dvd_date": "Jun 11, 2007", "box_office": "$33.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The twisted tale, told with black and bitter humour and robust language, reaches a conclusion of tortured and wholly satisfying irony.", "As a thriller, it's a pretty solid affair -- and there's no getting away from how unsettling the tone is.", "An auspicious first feature; although relentlessly benighted, it is nevertheless beautifully filmed and well-acted.", "A descent into the hellish depths of one of those many recently privatized coal mines under China's new flirtation with the market economy.", "", "a spare and spine-tingling exercise in pure Hitchcockian suspense", "", "", "A disturbing morality tale that questions how far one will go to survive under such conditions.", "This crafty little character piece keeps you guessing. If that wasn't enough, it also gets in some social commentary.", "The staccato, noirish film is proof, however, that China has no shortage of filmmaking talent.", "Depicts a way of life in China that I have no way of verifying but that I have to assume is relatively accurate. Either way, it's a decent film, not great but good enough.", "The disparity between our mental rhythms and the script's gets in the way of ingesting what Blind Shaft has to say about unchecked opportunism.", "Weaves a tiny and compelling story, then manages to fix it within a larger tapestry of a culture bracing itself in a rush toward greed and prosperity.", "The deliberately paced film, with understated performances..., is rich with ambiance, painting a memorable and lurid portrayal of China's economic boom.", "Fresh, stark and consistently uncompromising, Li Yang's Blind Shaft is an exceptional Chinese film noir.", "If Martin Scorsese had been born in China, Blind Shaft is the sort of movie he might have made.", "Engrossing because of its amazingly well-documented milieu, which German-trained writer-director Li Yang filmed on location in the northern provinces.", "The end result is somewhat unsatisfying, largely because its twists aren't all that surprising and its outcome seems foreordained.", "Makes for gripping, merciless drama."], "rating": ["", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "B-", "4/4", "3/4", "3/4", "3.5/4", "B-", "3/5", "B+", "3/5", "3.5/4", "3/4", "3/4", "2.5/4", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Neil Norman", "Ken Hanke", "Maria Garcia", "Prairie Miller", "", "Don Willmott", "Daniel Kasman", "", "Sean P.
