{"metadata": {"synopsis": "During the 1930s in England, a group of young socialites dominate the national gossip with extravagant and outlandish antics. Among the group is the aspiring novelist Adam Fenwick-Symes (Stephen Campbell Moore), who is attempting to raise enough money to marry fellow member Nina Blount (Emily Mortimer). However, after customs officials confiscate his first manuscript, Fenwick-Symes must recover from the financial setback and figure out new ways to earn money for a wedding.", "rating": "65", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Stephen Fry", "studio": "RevolutionFilms,DoubtingHallLimited", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 4, 2019", "box_office": "$931.8K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["What's good about the movie is the lesser known up-and-corners who play the bright young things themselves, especially the appellatorily appropriate Fenella Woolgar as Agatha", "Fry's dialogue is terrific and interlaces with Waugh's own wit seamlessly.", "Satire should seek to sterilise or maim its targets; Fry wants us to feel for them.", "", "", "Though it falls short of Fry's best work in other fields, this is a sound first feature.", "The wit never comes through the art deco settings.", "If a movie can draw this kind of talent for mostly miniscule roles, how can you go wrong?", "The 'wit' is leaden and unfunny; the narrative's progress ungainly; the direction stolid.", "The film is a breezy and likable enough entertainment, especially for those of us unfamiliar with Waugh's original.", "It is in the humorous moments that the movie really hits its stride, with the supporting cast providing many of the laughs.", "One conceit of writer-director Stephen Fry is to dramatize parties as knots of chaos, social hurricanes that spill across the landscape this way and that, ruining lives, eating time, preventing progress of any kind.", "The uninitiated are hereby warned: Bright Young Things has an exclusionary timbre.
