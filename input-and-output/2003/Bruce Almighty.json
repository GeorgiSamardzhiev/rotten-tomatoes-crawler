{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Bruce Nolan's (Jim Carrey) career in TV has been stalled for a while, and when he's passed over for a coveted anchorman position, he loses it, complaining that God is treating him poorly. Soon after, God (Morgan Freeman) actually contacts Bruce and offers him all of his powers if he thinks he can do a better job. Bruce accepts and goes on a spree, using his new-found abilities for selfish, personal use until he realizes that the prayers of the world are going unanswered.", "rating": "48", "genre": "Comedy/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Tom Shadyac", "studio": "SpyglassEntertainment", "theater_date": "May 23, 2003", "dvd_date": "Dec 1, 2015", "box_office": "$242.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's a nice return to comedy for Carrey.", "While Carrey's antics are good for some laughs, the film ultimately falls apart, thanks to a heavy-handed screenplay with enough sugar and sweetness to induce a diabetic coma.", "Although Carrey's built-in audience base will undoubtedly be thanking The Almighty this weekend for Bruce Almighty, with so many other films out there right now, this one can be put on the back burner.", "Spiritual enlightenment is served as a side dish to the main course of orgasm and orifice jokes. Steve Carell gets the film's only good scene, easily You-Tubed, with an on-air gibberish seizure.", "As entertainment, it gives good value: it's light, quick and diverting. Morgan Freeman, predictably, gives it heart, gravitas and the appearance of wisdom; but it's Carrey who keeps all the balls in the air with refined mania.", "It's no divine comedy, there's no real revelation, but the funny bits are up there with Jim Carrey's best.", "There are enough goofball touches in Bruce Almighty to carry the movie to a certain extent... However, when the time comes for Bruce to \"share and learn\", the effect is trite and embarrassing.", "Happily deranged comedy has typical Carrey humor.", "Ultimately, Bruce Almighty is an excuse for Jim Carrey to be crazy and zany. He puts on his comedy hat and has fun with the script. It's made for the Jim Carrey fan.", "For all its swings for the fences, the movie never rises above being lightly amusing.", "It fails to really use Carrey's comedic ability and it ultimately wastes the potential it reaps.", "The inspiration flags after a while, but there are many hilarious moments, and the resolution (thanks to Jennifer Aniston as Carrey's put-upon girlfriend) is sweetly touching.", "There's remarkably little done with a premise snatched from high-concept heaven, adding yet another file to the growing cabinet of under-realized comedies.", "This is another of Jim Carrey's surefire vehicles that can be whittled down to a phrase: Jim Carrey is the Grinch; Jim Carrey is God.", "The premise sounds good, but this time around the result is forced and undercooked.", "If only the writers had thought to open up the concept beyond dog-on-toilet gags.", "Director Shadyac and his three scriptwriters prove much more fallibly flawed than their omnipotent hero.", "But the big surprise is Carell. Known mainly for playing one of Julia-Louis Dreyfus' friends on the anemic sitcom Watching Ellie, the young funnyman is a revelation here.", "", ""], "rating": ["3.0/4", "", "", "1/5", "", "B", "", "3/5", "3/5", "2/4", "", "3/5", "", "2/5", "2/4", "2/5", "", "2.5/4", "2.5/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Micheal Compton", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Nick Rogers", "Alexander Walker", "Joel Siegel", "Barbara Ellen", "Nell Minow", "Kevin Carr", "Michael Dequina", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Jim Lane", "Robert Koehler", "Rob Gonsalves", "Joe Lozito", "David Cornelius", "", "Sara Michelle Fetters", "", ""], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Midwest Film Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Good Morning America", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">7M Pictures", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieReport.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sacramento News &amp; Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Big Picture Big Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MovieFreak.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bullz-Eye.com"], "date": ["September 4, 2020", "November 15, 2019", "November 7, 2019", "June 24, 2019", "January 9, 2018", "January 4, 2018", "January 3, 2018", "December 22, 2010", "September 21, 2010", "January 9, 2010", "April 29, 2009", "August 7, 2008", "July 29, 2008", "August 11, 2007", "July 14, 2007", "June 9, 2007", "June 24, 2006", "December 9, 2005", "December 6, 2005", "July 5, 2005"]}}
