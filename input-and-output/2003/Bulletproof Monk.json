{"metadata": {"synopsis": "For 60 years, a mysterious monk with no name (Chow Yun-Fat) has zigzagged the globe to protect an ancient scroll -- a scroll that holds the key to unlimited power. Now the Monk must look for a new scroll keeper. Kar (Seann William Scott) is an unlikely candidate, a streetwise young man whose only interest is himself. But when he inadvertently saves the Bulletproof Monk from capture, the two become partners in a scheme to save the world from the scroll's most avid pursuer.", "rating": "23", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Paul Hunter", "studio": "LakeshoreEntertainment,MosaicMediaGroup", "theater_date": "Apr 16, 2003", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$23.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["basically Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon comes to New York", "Not to put too fine a point on it, but \"Bulletproof Monk\" is a rather large piece of garbage.", "Violent but cool martial arts movie.", "This is one piece of derivative, hokey, and really stupid action drivel.", "An enticing title that perfectly sets up our anticipation for a rollicking martial-arts comic-book fable adventure.", "The constantly beaming monk is as good-natured as the script is mindless.", "The fight scenes are routine, the humor juvenile, and the Toronto locales rendered drab through muddy cinematography.", "It's painful to watch.", "Chow was never a martial arts star back home, but he's a good enough actor -- and an engaging enough personality -- to pass for one here.", "Paul Hunter edits his action scenes so much that it's really difficult to see anything spectacular, and the special effects aren't anything to drool over.", "... bringing music-video director Paul Hunter was a good move for pacing, but he could use a few lessons in filming fight scenes.", "The bottom line is, this qualifies as a guilty pleasure.", "Too much time is given over to the absolutely dire script.", "very childish, and just a little trashy.", "Chow Yun-Fat delivers stylish action and finally shows American audiences a sense of humor, but watching Stifler get his kung fu on is just a little too hard to swallow.", "An uneasy combination of self-help bromides, poorly edited fight sequences and music video-style flash.", "...nonstop fighting, kicking, punching, and killing, with a dollop of juvenile humor thrown in.", "If you're a fan of martial arts, and fancy an alternative to the heavy going comic adaptations ahead, then this is your bag.", "The odd-couple chemistry between Chow and Scott carries the film until the unimaginative buddy formula wears thin.", "It's supremely ironic: the scroll defeats the body's natural decaying process. In today's movies, so does the computer. It's even more efficient than plastic surgery, but just as phoney."], "rating": ["4/5", "0/4", "4/5", "", "", "2/5", "", "1/5", "", "2.5/5", "", "2.5/4", "5/10", "1/4", "5.5/10", "2/5", "5/10", "3/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Kevin Carr", "David N.
