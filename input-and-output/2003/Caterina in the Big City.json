{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Catarina (Alice Teghil) moves with her father, Giancarlo (Sergio Castellitto), and mother, Agata (Margherita Buy), from her country town to Rome. At her high school, she finds herself in the middle of a tug-of-war between leftists, led by Margherita (Carolina Iaquaniello), and opposing rightists, led by Daniela (Federica Sbrenna) -- and they all want to use her for their own ends. Her overbearing father gets in on the act, hoping the parents of Caterina's new friends can get his novel published.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Paolo Virz\u00ec", "studio": "Cattleya,RaiCinema", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$293.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A truly wonderful coming-of-age tale, suffused with wit and warmth.", "", "On the surface, Caterina in the Big City is like Mean Girls, Italian-style.

There's a realness on screen that translates to any culture.", "Though Caterina is unusually well-acted and crafted for this kind of movie ... Giancarlo is the one character who makes the movie special.", "Played in a manic, volcanic manner by Castellitto, Giancarlo is a constant source of humor and embarrassment.", "...a funny, affecting, and intricate comedy that continually surprises and gets better as it goes along.", "It's not a satire, it's a family drama whose social and political thoughts flicker like a neon sign on the fritz. Alas, sentimentality is the movie's pilot light.", "A warm and resonant comedy.", "Caterina in the Big City won't change your life, but it moves along spiffily and the young Teghil is adorable as she adventures gamely onward.", "A lovely and thoughtful exploration of the end of childhood innocence.", "The film uses its surprisingly sly humor to win over the audience and also manages to say quite a bit about the differences between the haves and have-nots of the world, yet without becoming too full of itself.", "A blend of gentle comedy and poignant drama.", "Subtitles that are damnably hard to read are all that gets in the way of Virz's story, which simultaneously suffices as a teen drama and a political metaphor.", "", "Like its heroine, Caterina in the Big City is delightfully unclassifiable, a modest, unassuming movie, but a rule-breaker nonetheless."], "rating": ["", "3/4", "B+", "2.5/4", "3/4", "", "3/5", "B", "3/4", "2.5/4", "7/10", "2.5/4", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "3/4", "", "", "3/5", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Noh", "Chelsea Bain", "Eleanor Ringel Cater", "Chris Hewitt", "John Monaghan", "Jean Lowerison", "Cherryl Dawson and Leigh Ann Palone", "Mario Tarradell", "Michael Wilmington", "Rene Rodriguez", "Josh Ralske", "Wesley Morris", "Carrie Rickey", "Stephen Hunter", "Roger Moore", "Jeff Vice", "Michael O&#39;Sullivan", "Steve Schneider", "", "Lisa Rose"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Journal International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Herald", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Atlanta Journal-Constitution", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">St. Paul Pioneer Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Detroit Free Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Diego Metropolitan", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieChicks.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dallas Morning News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Miami Herald", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">All Movie Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Globe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Deseret News (Salt Lake City)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newark Star-Ledger"], "date": ["March 1, 2007", "October 21, 2006", "November 3, 2005", "October 7, 2005", "October 7, 2005", "September 24, 2005", "September 23, 2005", "September 22, 2005", "September 8, 2005", "August 26, 2005", "August 4, 2005", "July 22, 2005", "July 21, 2005", "July 15, 2005", "July 15, 2005", "July 15, 2005", "July 14, 2005", "July 14, 2005", "July 5, 2005", "July 1, 2005"]}}
