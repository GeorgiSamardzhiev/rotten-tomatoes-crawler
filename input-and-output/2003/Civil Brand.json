{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Things are tough at Whitehead Correctional Institute, a notorious women's prison. The inmates include Lil' Mamma (Lark Voorhies), a pregnant teen, and Nikki (N'Bushe Wright), the queen bee of Whitehead. The inmates are under the supervision of abusive warden Dease (Clifton Powell), who forces them to endure hours of hard labor, from which he profits. Eventually, the women band together and reach out to part-time prison guard Michael (Mos Def), a law student, who helps them fight for reform.", "rating": "16", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Cult Movies/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Neema Barnette", "studio": "MandalayEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 7, 2016", "box_office": "$243.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Wildly uneven, rife with a virtual checklist of human tragedies that build to easy emotional crescendos but fail to engage the audience well enough to evoke any meaning.", "It's impossible to ignore the strain of misogyny that taints the movie.", "It's guilty of gross B-movie meltdown, but mitigating circumstances include honest anger and a scattering of vivid scenes.", "This is a film about the abuses of privatization and presents a negative view of what might happen if corporate America gets control of the business of corrections.", "There's way too much of the usual bonding, beatings, petty humiliation by guards, cat fights in the yard and trips to the hole.", "Barnette, a veteran TV director, means this as an expos of prison abuse and exploitation, but the film is too simplistic and derivative to succeed.", "Artistically, its heavy-handed clumsiness undercuts its goals.", "It presents a heated-up, awkward blend of earnest outrage and down-and-dirty exploitation.", "Plagued by continuity problems, ham-fisted storytelling and a problematic voiceover by Da Brat, Civil Brand feels less like a prison movie than a prison sentence.", "Without a scorcher like Pam Grier, the sub-NYPD Blue dialogue and acting dilute what could have been a shrieking wake-up call about for-profit prisons.", "If Civil Brand hopes to raise awareness or instigate reform, what it really needs is a greater focus on character over convention.", "Hollywood still doesn?t seem to understand that just because someone can sing doesn't mean they can act. If this film doesn't prove that point, nothing will.", "Although the film loses its way in the late going with a preponderance of melodramatic elements that dilute the more compelling social message, for much of its running time it packs a visceral punch.", "Women behind bars! While that's the perfect set-up for a late-night, soft-core cable movie, this flick is guilty of being nothing more than a jailhouse crock.", "The movie is every bit as exploitative as the old Roger Corman babes-behind- bars flicks without having nearly as much campy fun.", "After two smart acts, the film almost becomes the exploitation flick it so desperately wants to avoid.", "A compelling, highly charged film that brings a contemporary perspective to classic prison picture elements.", "If Civil Brand works ... as an updated women's prison melodrama with a strong whisper of political consciousness, there are some crippling flaws in the film.", "Muckraking mess of a movie."], "rating": ["", "1.5/4", "", "3/4", "2/5", "1/4", "D", "2/5", "1/4", "", "1.5/4", "1.5/5", "", "C-", "1/4", "", "4/5", "", "2.5/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Todd Gilchrist", "Elizabeth Weitzman", "Bob Campbell", "Jonathan W.
