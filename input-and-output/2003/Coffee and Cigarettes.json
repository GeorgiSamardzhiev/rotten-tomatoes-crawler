{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This 11-vignette film focuses on the human interactions that happen while partaking in the everyday indulgence of coffee and cigarettes. Featuring well-known actors and other artists as themselves or some version thereof, the film highlights the nuances and subtle hostilities that can be a part of seemingly normal conversations. Bill Murray waits on the Wu-Tang Clan, Iggy Pop and Tom Waits get on each others' nerves and Jack and Meg White of the White Stripes discuss Nikola Tesla.", "rating": "64", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "Jim Jarmusch", "studio": "AsmikAceEntertainment", "theater_date": "May 14, 2004", "dvd_date": "Feb 14, 2017", "box_office": "$2.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Jarmusch is definitely an acquired taste, but his true fans will find this collection a joy and fans of film who long for the simplicity of true filmmaking.", "I have the horrible feeling that in cold print that sounds a lot livelier than it is.
