{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This fusion of fiction and biography based on the director's own life focuses on a hockey player, Guy Maddin (Darcy Fehr), whose life spirals out of control when his mother (Marion Martin) winds up in the hospital and his girlfriend, Veronica (Amy Stewart), gets pregnant and then asks for an abortion. Maddin secures one for her, but he also falls for Meta (Melissa Dionisio), the mysterious daughter of the abortionist, triggering even more trouble.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Drama/Special Interest/Romance", "runtime": "1h 4m", "director": "Guy Maddin", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 17, 2020", "box_office": "$22.9K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Shot in five days, \"Cowards Bend The Knee\" is not exactly automatic writing-Maddin knows exactly which Greek tragedies he's pillaging-but it feels like a direct flood from the unconscious. His most dreamlike film, it's also his most heartfelt.", "... a miniature, barely more than an hour long... but it bubbles over with lust, guilt, and betrayal, not to mention weirdness.", "Plays like a fever dream recalled upon waking, told with the immediacy of fear couched in relentless pleasure.", "A dreamlike tale told by an idiosyncratic storyteller who is hyper-imaginative.", "If you've never seen Maddin's work, Cowards Bend the Knee is a good place to start.", "If you're a fan of Maddin's expressionist style, you'll find the humor within. Everyone else will be scratching their heads, despite Maddin's extraordinary visual imagination.", "There's no denying the imagination and technical ingenuity on display, but this clearly ranks as one of Maddin's less accessible efforts, which is definitely saying something.", "Lurid, tawdry and untoward entertainment from Canada's reigning mad genius.", "Although only an hour long, the movie -- which uses intertitles to convey dialogue -- may seem endless to those who have not acquired a taste for Maddin's surreal mayhem.", "There's a new visual idea every second, each teeming with energy, pitch-dark comedy, and inspired cinematic lunacy.", "The pleasure is watching how the fast-paced story careens from one outrageous plot turn to the next. This is one film in which over-the-top is sincere praise.", "Most of Maddin's usual preoccupations are in evidence -- guilt, incest, sexual obsession, voyeurism, early cinema and Maddin's greatest love, hockey -- and as luridly entertaining as ever.", "It's bliss, I tell you!", "There is also something rather splendid about this extended-play peep show, as if Mr. Maddin had stumbled across a hitherto lost archive of cinema's less-than-innocent past.", "What's truly extraordinary about this movie -- which strikes me on two viewings as Maddin's masterpiece -- is that it not only plays like a dream but feels like one.", "One of the most brilliant works of an unapologetically eccentric, and endlessly inventive, director.", "Cowards Bend the Knee is paradoxically retrograde and ultramodern.", "", "Even by the standards of Maddin's past works, it is a unique creation -- intense, ridiculous, but also deeply personal.", "Yep, Freud would have a field day.
