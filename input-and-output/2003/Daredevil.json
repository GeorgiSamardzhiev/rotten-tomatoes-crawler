{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Attorney Matt Murdock (Ben Affleck) is blind, but his other four senses function with superhuman sharpness. By day, Murdock represents the downtrodden. At night, he is Daredevil, a masked vigilante, a relentless avenger of justice. When Wilson Fisk (Michael Clarke Duncan) hires Bullseye (Colin Farrell) to kill Daredevil, Murdock must rely on his own senses and search out the conspirators against justice -- which may include his own girlfriend, Elektra (Jennifer Garner).", "rating": "44", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Mark Steven Johnson", "studio": "NewRegencyPictures,20thCenturyFox,RegencyEnterprises,MarvelEnterprises,HorseshoeBayProductions", "theater_date": "Feb 14, 2003", "dvd_date": "Oct 21, 2015", "box_office": "$102.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An event pic that is big, brassy and bullying enough to make you forget how little of it is actually making sense.", "When you compress almost forty years of storytelling into a single movie, you need a writer of considerable talent to winnow a massive amount of material into an entertaining and intelligible film. Mark Steven Johnson does not apparently possess that...", "Alas. You'll have to be pretty daring yourself to go see Daredevil.", "Daredevil has a brooding dark and dank air about it, much like Batman. That's about the only element that lends the movie any character.", "Gatorade baths and clingy clothes.", "From start to finish, the film is death-ridden and employs overamplified sound to pump up its many pornographic images.", "It isn't a great film, or even a greatly original one. Still, it has many grace notes, and interesting oddities.", "Much of the rest of Daredevil is so dark that you can't see it. I don't think you're missing a great deal.", "Writer-director Mark Steven Johnson's movie is too heavily reliant on tried and tested ingredients, such as Batman-type design and Matrix-style fighting.", "The ghostly sonar effects showing how Matt \"sees\" through sound are interesting, and Farrell's mad dog performance is fun. But overall Daredevil is nothing to marvel about.", "Much of the film is a setup for hoped-for sequels, so the plot isn't really the thing. But Daredevil benefits from some strong supporting roles.", "When Farrell's on screen, Daredevil becomes more than just a finely tuned entertainment machine. In a movie that will rake people in no matter what, it's fun to see something unexpected.", "Daredevil, as brought to the screen by writer/director Mark Steven Johnson, brings real violence and death into the comic book mix, and the result is a fascinating blend of the fantastic and the tragic.", "Daredevil is a perfectly serviceable B-movie, something to tide over genre fans waiting for X-Men 2.", "There's good stuff in the margins. But on the heels of such successful comic-book adaptations as X-Men and Spider-Man, Johnson's film makes Daredevil look like the second-rate hero he never really was.", "For all its clichs, it has a cracking third act, helped by doses of 15-rated violence.", "there's a lot to like here and a comic film more people should give another chance.", "Superhero is darker, more violent than Spiderman.", "Torn between moody grandiosity and cartoonish mayhem, Daredevil tries to have it both ways, and succeeds at neither.", "The film is impressively dark and gritty, but the melodrama and Daredevil's relationship with woman warrior Elektra are labored."], "rating": ["3/5", "", "", "1/4", "", "", "", "", "", "C", "3/4", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "6.5/10", "3/5", "", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Leigh Paatsch", "Kathi Maio", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Namrata Joshi", "Leona Laurie", "Alexander Walker", "Joe Morgenstern", "David Denby", "Christopher Tookey", "Steve Persall", "Matt Soergel", "Ben Nuckols", "Mike Goodridge", "Edward Johnson-Ott", "Keith Phipps", "Matthew De Abaitua", "Jeffrey Lyles", "Nell Minow", "David Ansen", "Mark Halverson"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Outlook", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Geek Girl Authority", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Mail (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tampa Bay Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Florida Times-Union", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">NUVO Newsweekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lyles&#39; Movie Files", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sacramento News &amp; Review"], "date": ["June 2, 2020", "February 28, 2020", "November 7, 2019", "January 4, 2019", "August 29, 2018", "December 14, 2017", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "July 14, 2015", "July 13, 2015", "October 19, 2012", "July 30, 2012", "December 22, 2010", "July 7, 2010", "July 7, 2010"]}}
