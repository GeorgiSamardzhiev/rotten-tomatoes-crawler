{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Eva has been in charge of her younger sisters ever since their parents died, many years ago. Eva's uncanny ability to interfere in her sisters' affairs has not endeared her to their spouses and partners. The men would like to close out and divide up the family trust fund that Eva oversees. So they concoct a simple plan: compensate cash strapped ladies' man Ray Adams (LL Cool J) to romance and distract Eva from her familial duties.
