{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A barren soundstage is stylishly utilized to create a minimalist small-town setting in which a mysterious woman named Grace (Nicole Kidman) hides from the criminals who pursue her. The town is two-faced and offers to harbor Grace as long as she can make it worth their effort, so Grace works hard under the employ of various townspeople to win their favor. Tensions flare, however, and Grace's status as a helpless outsider provokes vicious contempt and abuse from the citizens of Dogville.", "rating": "70", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Mystery & Suspense/Special Interest", "runtime": "2h 58m", "director": "Lars von Trier", "studio": "ZentropaEntertainments,CanalPlusImageInternational,AlanYoungPictures,41/2", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 6, 2016", "box_office": "$1.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Dogville's tongue-clucking point-and von Trier makes it broadly-is the hypocrisy of the Good Samaritan, but a less clinical film could have done so more powerfully.", "A bold, beautiful work of art.", "Kidman has never lacked the courage to perform in innovative productions on stage and screen, such as The Blue Room and Eyes Wide Shut. In this film, which is a bit of both, she acquits herself gamely.", "For its exuberance and its difference, its fine performances and its devastating finale, Dogville is essential viewing.", "[Director] Trier attempts to pass this off as art, when really it's just ridiculous.", "Thought provoking with its dense and intense themes, Dogville highlights the best and the worst in us all; the emotions it agitates are hard to shake.", "", "These elements come together to form a movie that is clinically ironic but also unique, inspired, and quite sublime.", "This minimalist, digital-video-shot film has its own cinematic flash and thunder, and does things only movies can do.", "An exceptionally literary film that at the same time employs extremely theatrical set design. Leave it to the mad genius of Denmark to kick cinema's ass once again.", "After about an hour, the novelty wears off, and you're aching to see an actual animal and real shrubs.
