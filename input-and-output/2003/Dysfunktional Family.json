{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This live concert film features comedian Eddie Griffin performing his stand-up act. The central theme of the concert is family and how Griffin's difficult yet loving clan helped him become a star. Griffin introduces his family via anecdotes and documentary footage, relating infamous tales, including how his mother once chased him down with her car, how an uncle's drug abuse almost destroyed him and the pride another uncle took in his prodigious pornography collection.", "rating": "43", "genre": "Comedy/Documentary", "runtime": "1h 23m", "director": "George Gallo", "studio": "GoldCircleFilms", "theater_date": "Apr 4, 2003", "dvd_date": "Apr 14, 2016", "box_office": "$2.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Even when some of his material has a \"been there, heard that\" sense to it, Griffin's outbursts of charisma help elevate the overall presentation.", "Click to read review", "Griffin's paean to beating your children is more than a little disturbing.", "Eddie notes he if had a gay son, he'd tie him to a bed and send in a whore every hour. \"How can any father be proud of a having a gay son?\" he asks bewilderedly.", "", "Having really enjoyed \"Undercover Brother,\" I went out of my way to catch this film and ended up laughing so hard, I cried at times.", "", "For every bit that's flatly derivative ... there's another that connects.", "Offensive is easy. Daring takes brains. And brains seem to be in short supply here -- almost in as short supply as laughs and audiences.", "Interminable going, not only because the forward momentum of Griffin's stand-up is routinely interrupted by annoying side trips to visit his porno-loving uncle or his cringing mom, but also because Griffin's material just isn't that funny.", "Like those proverbial million monkeys with their typewriters, Griffin manages to get off a halfway-funny line every now and again.", "... Griffin's social commentary is just as piercing and hilarious as the autobiographical stuff.", "A fun if not particularly revelatory slice of entertainment, Griffin's concert film seems largely designed only to shock with vulgarity without searching for the deeper 'why' behind the jokes.", "Griffin's keen wit, coupled with director Gallo's sense of pacing & alternating stage and offstage material makes this more than a concert film.", "", "Griffin's family is fascinating and real, and his comedy, while it can be caustic, has a positive spirit.", "One of the funnier and, in an odd way, disturbing stand-up concert films in a long while.", "Highlights some of the best, and raunchiest, of [Griffin's] humor.", "Far too much of Griffin's routine is just that -- routine.", "The cross-cutting feels too casual and is mostly executed in a jarringly random fashion."], "rating": ["4/5", "3/4", "2/5", "", "1/4", "3.5/4", "1/10", "B-", "1/5", "1.5/5", "2/5", "", "C+", "4/5", "1.5/4", "B+", "", "2.5/4", "2/5", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Brian Mckay", "Michael Dequina", "Josh Bell", "Brandon Judell", "Susan Tavernetti", "Ross Anthony", "Brian Orndorf", "Owen Gleiberman", "Ken Hanke", "Marc Savlov", "Jim Lane", "Richard Roeper", "Brent Simon", "Karina Montgomery", "Guylaine Cadorette", "Marshall Fine", "Michael O&#39;Sullivan", "Claudia Puig", "Maitland McDonagh", "Ted Fry"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieReport.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Las Vegas Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gay City News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Palo Alto Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Report Card", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Modamag.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Austin Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sacramento News &amp; Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Ebert &amp; Roeper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Today", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinerina", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Journal News (Westchester, NY)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">USA Today", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times"], "date": ["May 25, 2004", "January 18, 2004", "September 6, 2003", "June 3, 2003", "May 20, 2003", "April 16, 2003", "April 13, 2003", "April 9, 2003", "April 8, 2003", "April 7, 2003", "April 7, 2003", "April 7, 2003", "April 7, 2003", "April 6, 2003", "April 5, 2003", "April 5, 2003", "April 4, 2003", "April 4, 2003", "April 4, 2003", "April 4, 2003"]}}
