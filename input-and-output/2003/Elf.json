{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Buddy (Will Ferrell) was accidentally transported to the North Pole as a toddler and raised to adulthood among Santa's elves. Unable to shake the feeling that he doesn't fit in, the adult Buddy travels to New York, in full elf uniform, in search of his real father. As it happens, this is Walter Hobbs (James Caan), a cynical businessman. After a DNA test proves this, Walter reluctantly attempts to start a relationship with the childlike Buddy with increasingly chaotic results.", "rating": "84", "genre": "Comedy/Kids & Family/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Jon Favreau", "studio": "GuyWalksintoaBarProductions,Gold/MillerProductions,ShawnDanielleProductionServices,MosaicMediaGroup", "theater_date": "Nov 7, 2003", "dvd_date": "Dec 11, 2015", "box_office": "$177.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Classic family Christmas fodder: the gorgeous candyfloss colour schemes and New York in all its resplendent wintry beauty help the film pass effortlessly by too.", "Captures the spirit that I long to have during the holiday season.", "Simplicity.

Go celebrate Christmas a little early with Elf -- a new Christmas classic for the 21st century.", "It's a really fun holiday film.", "There are few cinematic ventures that capture the Christmas spirit in such abundance and hit the Holiday target so directly on the nose.", "Will Ferrell's over-the-top performance in Elf is one of the reasons why the comedy has managed to stand the test of time.", "Families have discovered how funny and how well this little film tells its King-sized holiday message: the only size that counts is how big your heart is.", "While his plotting may leave a little to be desired, Favreau directs with speed, humour and efficiency.", "Ferrell is a hoot. So is much of this witty holiday family entertainment, which, up until the end, when the \"true spirit of Christmas\" must be reaffirmed, happily favors slapstick over treacle.", "Raise a glass of cheer to Ferrell and Favreau. They might not have created a full-scale holiday classic here, but they've certainly given us a fresh, sparkly new bauble to hang on our perennial tree.", "Will Ferrell has the ability to turn those wide eyes and that big body into a potent comic weapon, so Elf gets a good number of laughs from his complete, innocent abandonment to his role as a lummox-size elf.", "It was all very simple, but enough to remind me just what a generous and talented performer Will Ferrell truly is.", "Elf is a Christmas comedy that's as sweet-natured and goofily amusing as its title character.", "required viewing during the holiday season", "All told, Elf is undeniably cute, but not destined to become a Christmas classic. Nevertheless, children will love it.", "A gleeful, cracked fairytale.", "Dressed in a snug green outfit throughout and dispensing decorations, sugary snacks and a beaming grin, Ferrell is the life and soul of an otherwise unexceptional Christmas celebration.", "It would be Scrooge-like to say mean things about the innocuous Elf, so I'll just point out that director Jon Favreau's film rarely reaches its full comic potential.", "Sure, Elf feels a little too feel-good at the end, but what do you expect? It's a Christmas movie!
