{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this dreamlike film, a nameless father (Andrei Shchetinin) and his son, Aleksei (Aleksei Nejmyshev), live together in an apartment in St. Petersburg. Aleksei's mother has died and consequently the two have a very close relationship. When Aleksei acquires a girlfriend, she refuses to take a back seat to his bond with his dad, and breaks up with him. Aleksei is also experiencing nightmares, dreading separation from his father to be a part of the military as his father was.", "rating": "68", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 23m", "director": "Aleksandr Sokurov", "studio": "IsabellaFilmsB.V.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 26, 2004", "box_office": "$38.1K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "", "", "Visually remarkable look at a gay relationship; one of the richest inside looks at gay love and tenderness.", "Alexander Sokurov's obscure new film Father and Son doesn't quite come off.", "Tediously mannered look at the obsessive intimate bonds between a father and his teen-aged military son.", "for a hit of pure cinema, you could do no better...than to spend a few moments reveling in its high", "This strikingly beautiful film from Alexander Sokurov (Russian Ark) captures relationships in an ethereal way that gets way under the skin.", "A beautiful but static viewing experience that utterly fails to touch the viewer.", "Although Father and Son is never as deep or wrenching as Mother and Son, the careful casting and Sokurov's unique visual style continue to make this a series worth following.", "The film seems to have internalized Sokurov's inspiration so far that it becomes a blur of hints and vapors.", "Here was my question for most of this movie: Wha-?
