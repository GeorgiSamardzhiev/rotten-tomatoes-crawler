{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After spending part of her childhood in Japan, Amelie (Sylvie Testud) goes back after graduating from college to work as an interpreter at a corporation. The male executives treat her poorly, but she has a good relationship with Fubuki (Kaori Tsuji), her immediate supervisor. Unfortunately, Amelie sets herself up for a fall when she shows that despite being from Europe, she is adept at the Japanese language. Viewed as lacking in proper humility, her co-workers conspire to put her in her place.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Alain Corneau", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 19, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "A clean S&M flick which only devotees of mental cruelty are likely to find satisfying.
