{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This compilation of footage from the Grateful Dead's Canadian train tour depicts the height of the band's music and fame for five days in 1970, along with that of performances from Janis Joplin, Buddy Guy, The Band and The Flying Burrito Brothers. However, there's also a dark side shown alongside the seminal concerts, as when the train stops, the musicians are often confronted with worried promoters, inquisitive reporters and protesting students who can't afford ticket prices.", "rating": "96", "genre": "Documentary/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Bob Smeaton", "studio": "ApolloFilmsLtd.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 3, 2014", "box_office": "$1.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "", "Man, what were they smoking?
