{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When Judson Hammond (Walter Huston) is elected United States president during the Great Depression, he's seen by many as a hands-off, please-everyone type. After an astounding recovery from a car accident, however, Hammond awakes a changed man. Instituting sweeping, radical changes to the government -- including the dissolution of Congress and the revoking of the Constitution -- Hammond somehow manages to bring order to the country through dictatorship, along with world peace.", "rating": "80", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 27m", "director": "Gregory La Cava", "studio": "MetroGoldwynMayer,CosmopolitanFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 16, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The picture Gabriel is cheap, tawdry propaganda but not \"pointless.\"", "The film itself is full of long-winded patriotic speeches which seem peculiarly false.", "Gregory La Cava's 1933 New Deal fantasy is one of the strangest political films to escape the studios.", "A unique and somewhat daffy Depression-era comedy New Deal fantasy film.", "A classic example of pre-code Hollywood getting away with all kinds of depression-era madness.", "Of all the crackpot political films to come out of Hollywood ... this is surely the crackpottest, and must really be seen to be believed.", "Gabriel Over the White House encourages its viewers to live the fantasy of the philosopher-king, but never counts the costs of such a regime.", "", "Fascinating, original, definitely ahead of its time fantasy.", "", "A most interesting fantasy, dated and quaint by today's standards, but most interesting for its time.
