{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A sweeping epic charting the early years of the Civil War and how the campaigns unfolded from Manassas I to the Battle of Fredericksburg, this prequel to the film \"Gettysburg\" explores the motivations of the combatants and examines the lives of those who waited at home.", "rating": "8", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "3h 43m", "director": "Ronald F.

Part Three is threatened.", "The procession of monotonous, oddly gore-free battles breaks frequently for bloated speechifying.", "Then there is 'Gods and Generals,' cut from the same production cloth as 'Gettysburg' but a film of very loose ends.", "You will watch a series of battle re-enactments and wait for a film to break out.", "Every shot is fired in sorrow, and there are no villains - except, of course, for the politicians, who remain safely out of the frame.", "Thinks it is grand without ever being so.", "Imagine watching half of Band of Brothers in one sitting, but with the story moving at a much slower pace.", "Incredibly boring and badly acted.", "War may be Hell, but in this three-and-a-half-hour Civil War epic from Ronald Maxwell, the syrupy monologues and righteous Bible thumping provide the punishment.", "Swapping politics for crass platitudes, Gods and Generals is a monumental folly.", "An interesting film weakened by ham-fisted writing and direction and heavy-handed revisionism.", "Maxwell has made the, shall we say interesting, decision to change [Stonewall Jackson]God's hellcat into a warm and fuzzy teddy bear.", "A stiff and stilted historical pageant that somehow manages to make the savage tumult of thousands pitched against thousands seem not so much dreadul as dreadfully dull.", "Full of windy speeches about honor, god, fealty, and so on, the movie comes to a literal standstill whenever one of these noble addresses is about to be delivered.", "Stay far away from the three hour-plus Gods and Generals--unless, of course, you need a good nap."], "rating": ["1.5/4", "3/5", "C-", "", "", "2/5", "", "C-", "", "", "2/4", "2/5", "1/5", "", "1/5", "2/5", "1/5", "1/4", "1/5", "1/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Peter Canavese", "Nell Minow", "Steven D.
