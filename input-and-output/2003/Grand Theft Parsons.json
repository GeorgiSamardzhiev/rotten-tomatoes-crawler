{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Country-rock pioneer Gram Parsons (Gabriel Macht) and his friend and road manager Phil Kaufman (Johnny Knoxville) have a pact: Whichever of them dies first will be cremated, and the ashes will be spread in Joshua Tree National Park by the other. When Parsons dies suddenly at 26, Kaufman feels guilty for not having done more to save his friend's life, but he intends to keep his end of the bargain, even if it means stealing Parsons' corpse and outrunning the cops to do it.", "rating": "46", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "David Caffrey", "studio": "SwipeFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 20, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Shannon does a great turn as the archetypal failed hippy idealist... and while the rest of the cast are sterling rather than shining, the script and David Caffrey's tyro direction are tight enough to pull the whole vehicle along.", "Don't let Knoxville's Jackass pedigree put you off - he can be subtle as well as gross.", "", "there are worse ways to pay respect to music legends", "", "a sad joke without a solid punchline", "What I responded to most about Grand Theft Parsons is that it tells the story without excess sentimentality...a funny, engaging movie that's worth seeking out.", "", "Inspired by a true story, pic travels down familiar genre highways, but quirky humor and an apt soundtrack make for a pleasant enough journey.", "What could have served as a colorful episode in a more expansive film about the famed singer has instead become the premise of a mildly entertaining but overextended road movie that doesn't succeed on either dramatic or comedic terms.", "Grand Theft Parsons showcases some of Parsons's songs, but ... in the end it is a tribute to a man who stayed true to his word.", "The Phil-Larry dynamic makes up most of the movie and the strain of turning an anecdote into an demi-epic can be felt throughout the movie.", "A dramatically inert buddy-road picture that's too shapeless to ever click.", "Gram Parsons' last rites were among the most extraordinary in rock history. Too bad this retelling of the singer's final adventure is so tame.", "It's an aggravating film that seems content to skim the surface before folding up its tent after a scant 88 minutes.", "A ho-hum, meandering road movie, albeit with an extremely cool soundtrack.", "Parsons' memory deserves a better movie than this.", "Caffrey keeps the energy level high, and has populated the supporting roles with the most comical-looking character types ever assembled outside of a David Lynch film.", "The script ... leaves a lot to be desired, strewn with dialogue as flat and stale as old beer and some invented characters who make the events depicted seem more silly than anarchic.", "Since his death in 1973, the country singer Gram Parsons's legend has become a figure of worshipful legend, to which this rambling, low-key movie makes a modest contribution."], "rating": ["", "4/5", "3/5", "5/10", "4/5", "2.5/5", "3/4", "2/5", "", "", "", "2/4", "2/5", "2.5/4", "2/5", "2/4", "C-", "", "2/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Will Self", "Amber Wilkinson", "", "Dragan Antulov", "", "James Brundage", "Mike McGranaghan", "Kimberley Jones", "Leslie Felperin", "Frank Scheck", "Daniel Eagan", "John Anderson", "Ken Fox", "Elizabeth Weitzman", "Mark Keizer", "Megan Lehmann", "", "Luke Y.
