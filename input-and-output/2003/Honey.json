{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Honey Daniels (Jessica Alba) dreams of making a name for herself as a hip-hop choreographer. When she's not busy hitting downtown clubs with her friends, she teaches dance classes at a nearby community center in Harlem, N.Y., as a way to keep kids off the streets. Honey thinks she's hit the jackpot when she meets a hotshot director (David Moscow) who casts her in one of his music videos. But, when he starts demanding sexual favors from her, Honey makes a decision that will change her life.", "rating": "21", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 34m", "director": "Bille Woodruff", "studio": "UniversalPictures,NuAmericaEntertainment,MarcPlattProductions", "theater_date": "Dec 5, 2003", "dvd_date": "Mar 18, 2014", "box_office": "$30.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There is body horror here too, and a recognisable seam of 1950s paranoid SF, but at heart this is a slow-burning allegory of the radical change that comes with marital commitment", "", "Honey is just dumb but teens love it.", "", "", "This is fairy tale stuff, its saintly hip-hop heroine far too worthy for comfort and its dialogue hilariously banal.", "Oooh boy, whoever greenlit this baby is going to have some explaining to do.", "Alba's quite easy on the eye, and admittedly, a bit of a star in the making.", "What does Honey do in the face of dilemma?
