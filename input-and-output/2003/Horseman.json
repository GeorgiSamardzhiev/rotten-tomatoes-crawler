{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When Christian (Peter Marshall) finds out his runaway teenage daughter, Jesse (Hannah Levien), has been sexually attacked -- by way of a graphic video capturing the act -- the suburban father loses it. Setting out to find Jesse's attacker, Christian goes on a violent rampage. On the road, Christian meets a young hitchhiker named Alice (Caroline Marohasy) who reminds him of Jesse.

It would have been better if he had held his horses, as it were.", "A gritty, uncompromising thriller...", "a hard-hitting, sympathy-confounding thriller that painfully interrogates our own muddled feelings about the sex industry, retribution, and the limits of love, fatherly or otherwise - with an electrifying performance from Marshall.", "It offers better performances than you usually find in a bloodthirsty flick such as this, and heralds the debut of an exciting new filmmaker. The Horseman is for those who like their revenge films unburdened by emotional complexity.", "For all the rough edges, and perhaps because of them, The Horseman is compelling voyeurism, and the two leads are near on perfect.", "Marshall's performance, as the desperate, driven father, is striking; it gives the film an emotional centre without ever diminishing the horror of his character's actions.", "Certainly The Horseman is a calling card for Kastrissios' skills as a filmmaker; one just hopes he doesn't make The Horseman 2.", "Steve Kastrissios announces himself as one to watch with this very good thriller, which is smart, relentless and makes the most of it's limitations.", "The Horseman is utterly repulsive and beautiful at the same time, shot skillfully with varying degrees of shutter-speed adding to the hazy depth of Christian's mental fracture.", "A riveting revenge thriller, this debut by Steven Kastrissios seems certain to set him on a career path similar to one started by Greg McLean after his debut, Wolf Creek, as a calling card to attract international attention", "The Horseman is a gripping revenge film with an incredible kinetic energy.", "For such a film, The Horseman is too short of flair - there's not enough of it to distract us from the nastiness.", "A disgusting, repetitive, badly scripted movie, lacking any redeeming feature.", "This unflinchingly horrific revenge thriller has a whiff of Death Wish in its story of a father exacting retribution far beyond reason. But this ultra-violent bloodlust makes it hard to find a character to identify with.", "Unless you're a fan of the whole 'torture porn' genre, you'd be hard-pressed to actually enjoy it.", "It's mean and upsetting, but though the cruelty may undermine the message of vengeance breeding vengeance, it's never presented as slickly enjoyable or a facile solution.", "Despite some good performances and technical flair, The Horseman remains stuck in the paddock.", "For a revenge thriller, The Horseman strays dangerously close to \"torture porn\" territory, but it's so well made that you're almost willing to excuse the gratuitous close-ups.", "Biblical parallels are laid on with crowbar delicacy."], "rating": ["B-", "2/5", "2.5/4", "", "3.5/5", "", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "2/5", "", "3/5", "2/5", "4/5", "2.5/5", "4/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Brent McKnight", "Kaleem Aftab", "David Nusair", "Anton Bitel", "Simon Miraudo", "Jason Di Rosso", "Philippa Hawker", "Margaret Pomeranz", "Lachlan Huddy", "Sophia Watson", "Andrew L.
