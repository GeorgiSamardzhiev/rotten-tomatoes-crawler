Universal said The Hulk, and Lee heard something else, perhaps a story of dysfunctional families torn apart by ambition.", "Director Ang Lee has carefully crafted a movie that tells a very deliberate story, to the point where the action almost seems secondary. While some fans may be turned off by this approach, it's a fresh spin that works for the most part.", "By the time Hulk reaches its thermo-biblical climax, no one can complain that this is a macho blockbuster with no substance. Call it Crouching Ego, Hulking Id.", "Even if Lee would have wanted to rise above the simple two-dimensional universe of the comic books, his portrayal remains just as flat.", "In this one the Hulk bounces all over the place. The best part is Lou Ferrigno's cameo.", "The worst thing I can say about this movie is that it's so smart, so deep, so well done, it might be too good for the teenage boy-audience these films are usually aimed at. Then again, that might be the best thing I can say about it.", "Whatever problems it has as a story, at least Hulk tried, honestly and desperately, to push the comic book move into new places emotionally and stylistically.", "The Hulk lacks personality; not a great movie.", "Where so many comic-book movies feel as disposable as Kleenex, the passionate, uncynical \"Hulk\" stamps itself into your memory. Lee's movies are built to last.", "The best comic book adaptation I've seen so far with an excellent cast and top notch special effects...", "A turgid, CGI-Frankenstein reject", "The spectacular special effects and Lee's use of split screens provide some relief in a nonetheless tedious tale in which Nick Nolte (looking much like his recent mug shot) provides several unintentional laughs as Banner's father.", "The film almost matches the inner conflict of its titular character, intermittently bogged down even as it soars to seemingly impossible heights.", "Lee and Schamus try on film genres like The Silence of the Lambs' Buffalo Bill tries on human skin.", "The only Ang Lee film where he shows even a modicum of originality in his direction or any real personality or interesting visual flair.", "What a strange and fascinating contraption Hulk is.", "The way Lee orchestrates the film is closer to painting than directing. At times, it feels as though a graphic novel is being laid out on screen.", "[An] enjoyable summer behemoth.", "A talented director wasted on a poorly plotted and weakly acted film.
