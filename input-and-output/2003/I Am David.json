{"metadata": {"synopsis": "David (Ben Tibber) is a 12 year old on his own in an Eastern European prison camp. His best friend, Johannes (James Caviezel), protects and looks after him. One day, David is able to escape, and he embarks on a mission to deliver a sealed envelope to Denmark. Along the way, he saves a young girl (Viola Carinci) from a fire, befriends an elderly Swiss woman (Joan Plowright) and learns the value of trusting others. But what David discovers in Denmark truly changes his life forever.", "rating": "39", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Paul Feig", "studio": "WaldenMedia", "theater_date": "Dec 3, 2004", "dvd_date": "Nov 8, 2016", "box_office": "$284.0K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["While some parents might wish the film had more emotional depth, they will probably appreciate the gentle humor. Then they can introduce their children to the book.", "Get out the Game Boy instead.", "", "Clearly, huge tankers of disbelief must be suspended in a sea of goodwill to get into the spirit of the film.", "It's like Tom Sawyer's Great Escape - a strange combination of stories that's interesting, but doesn't quite capture your emotions.", "It is not an especially brilliant film, nor does it execute its ideas with particular flair, and yet I cannot resist liking and being moved by it.", "A nice enough picture, but it's also slow and meandering. Watching it is like seeing a decent Family Channel movie, except in this case you have to pay for it.", "While probably not suitable for the wee ones, older kids and most adults will love this exciting and heartfelt adventure of one boy's survival during the darkest days of post-war Europe.", "", "How David escapes, alas, is less compelling than wondering how this drearily earnest movie escaped the Hallmark Channel.", "The film is marred by too many coincidences, but there are a couple of twists at the end that tug at the heartstrings and leave you with a warm feeling.", "While the material itself has promise (it's an adaptation of Anne Holm's best-selling novel), this drama fumbles and stumbles its way to a resolution that's far too easy.", "It's not lack of a strong story that keeps I Am David from taking off. Blame a straightforward approach that makes the movie feel too much like an after-school special.", "It's refreshing to watch a movie aimed at young people that's actually grounded in reality.", "Feig's neorealist approach to the look of the film might work better if he didn't fill it with so many coincidences and melodramatic flourishes.", "I know, I know, I'm supposed to get sentimental about this heart-warming tale. But I couldn't believe a moment of it, and never identified with little David.", "One of those well-intentioned misfires that so frustrate both audiences and critics -- brimming with thematic potential, yet consistently unable to establish and maintain an effective tone.", "\"I Am David\" earns just about every teardrop it elicits. The journey isn't smooth, but that doesn't mean it isn't worthwhile.", "At its best in the taut opening and in the third act, when the pieces finally come together. In between, the episodic story sags a bit.", "It's a Hallmark Hall of Fame special dressed up as a feature, one that juggles feel-good humanitarianism and oddly inappropriate stabs at whimsy."], "rating": ["2/4", "1.5/5", "3/5", "B-", "3/5", "B-", "C", "3.5/5", "4/5", "2.5/4", "2/4", "2/4", "C+", "B", "2/4", "1.5/4", "2/5", "2.5/4", "B-", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Peter T.
