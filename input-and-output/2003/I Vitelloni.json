{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Five young men dream of success as they drift lazily through life in a small Italian village. Fausto (Franco Fabrizi), the group's leader, is a womanizer; Riccardo craves fame; Alberto (Alberto Sordi) is a hopeless dreamer; Moraldo (Franco Interlenghi) fantasizes about life in the city; and Leopoldo (Leopoldo Trieste) is an aspiring playwright. As Fausto chases a string of women, to the horror of his pregnant wife, the other four blunder their way from one uneventful experience to the next.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Federico Fellini", "studio": "Cit\u00e9Films", "theater_date": "Aug 26, 1953", "dvd_date": "Mar 11, 2017", "box_office": "$97.9K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["[I Vitelloni] unleashed the director's poetic/realist style, echoed perfectly in a shot of the five men at the pier, shrouded in mist and waiting for something, anything, to come along and take them away.", "Some of Fellini's finest work and can be warmly recommended.", "Probably no one since Chaplin has so well revealed the moments of simultaneous humor and tragedy which underscore human life.", "The musical vivacity which is so prevalent in much of Fellini's work finds its precursor here, as does the circus-like antics of the five young 'bulls'.", "Fellini's half-affectionate, half-acerbic nostalgia", "The idle class is somberly portrayed in Federico's authentic, frequently depressing I Vitelloni, a downbeat tale set in small-town Italy soon after the war.", "One of Fellini's greatest films (and first international hit) is a poignant, bitter-sweet satire about a clique of male friends who refuse or can't grow up into adulthood. The movie had influence on Scorsese, Levinson Lucas and other American directors.", "This is one of Fellini's best character studies and films.", "", "This semiautobiographical work by Federico Fellini was the first film to bring him a measure of world attention.", "Although the plot moves between set pieces, its dramatic structure is centered on the characters, individuals caught between terminal stasis and illegitimate dreams.", "This dilemma between the desire not to mature and the infallibility of age is best summated in Nino Rota's score. It highlights the film's beautiful final shots and lends the final exit an air of playful hope.", "It's as wistful and sad as it is funny and charming, with the first of Nino Rota's great scores to keep it burbling along.", "Proof of Fellini's early genius as a storyteller.", "Offers us the rare chance to witness a filmmaker becoming a master filmmaker, as well as the birth of an important relationship with composer Nino Rota.", "", "What stays fresh (and enhanced by the beautifully restored black- and-white print) is how so many of Fellini's gifts and obsessions are already apparent in this early work.", "It was this ineffably poignant semiautobiographical reverie that unleashed fully Fellini's shimmering, flowing poetic style.", "One of the screen's great portrayals of the hell-raising and malaise of young men in their 20s.", "A must-see for Fellini enthusiasts and a worthwhile investment for everyone else."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "7", "A", "A", "5/5", "4/4", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "A", "5/5", "3/4", "5/5", "4/4", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Asher Luberto", "David Stratton", "Merl Edelman", "Rob Aldam", "Fernando F.
