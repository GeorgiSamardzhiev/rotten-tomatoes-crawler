{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this dramatic re-creation, Jamal (Jamal Udin Torabi) and Enayat (Enayatullah) escape from the wretched Shamshatoo Refugee Camp in northwest Pakistan and embark on a perilous journey to England, where Jamal's uncle lives. Though they are initially caught by Iranian authorities and sent back, they ultimately make it through Iran to Istanbul, Turkey, smuggled there by paid human traffickers. To get to Italy, they must risk being shipped, and spend over a day in an unventilated container.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Michael Winterbottom", "studio": "BBC", "theater_date": "Nov 17, 2002", "dvd_date": "Mar 22, 2005", "box_office": "$74.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It is rewarding unlike any other film I've seen.", "That Winterbotton was able to pull this venture off at all is remarkable.", "...an odd hybrid of fiction and non-fiction, featuring a cast comprised mostly of amateur actors.", "Your heart will go out to [the characters], especially if your family made an arduous effort to reach America among the waves of immigrants over the last 130 years.", "Ferociously stakes a claim to the hearts, and minds, of viewers fortunate enough to see it.", "I'd like for some brave soul to sneak a copy [into the White House], just to bring a slap of reality to the residents of the presidential plastic bubble.", "It will definitely cause you to stop, consider and appreciate your life far more than you did yesterday.", "By keeping his focus small and personal, director Michael Winterbottom completely immerses a viewer in Jamal and Enayat's experience.
