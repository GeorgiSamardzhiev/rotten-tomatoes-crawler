And In the Cut is indeed a bad picture; surprisingly bad, really, given the pedigree involved.", "As in Portrait of a Lady, Campion demonstrates great faith in the fantasy sequence as a guide to the psyche, but this time the device seems simplistic .", "The plotting and police procedural aspects of In the Cut are perfunctory and unconvincing, and for all its air of breaking new ground, it is ploughing down some familiar furrows.", "The thriller elements are half-baked and predictable. The violence is never scary nor repellent.", "I still consider this the best (which also means the sexiest) Campion feature since The Piano, featuring Meg Ryan's finest performance to date and an impressive one by Mark Ruffalo.", "There's nothing terribly involving or enlightening in this brooding fever dream about life and death on the dingy margins of the city.", "It's about a lighthouse without any light except the revleation of a truth - and at that point, who cares?", "[Jane Campion] brings shocking beauty to a traditionally male genre - and proves she's not just cinema's most eloquent female filmmaker, but one of its essential visionaries.", "Campion excels in the erotic... She is, however, clearly useless at thrillers, and the final stages of this film fall just short of risible.", "What we end up with is a triumph of style over confused content.", "Beneath its dense texture and rich mood, Jane Campion's romantic thriller is about nothing and goes nowhere.", "I never found myself relaxed watching In the Cut. There is a pat, color-by-numbers quality to the inherent whodunit and the urban backdrop feels gratuitous and empty,", "Though the oppressive artiness makes the early scenes fairly ridiculous, the director's odd methods add rare tension to the climax, as it becomes evident that the finale won't be so predictable in Campion's hands.", "The camera explores the female body lovingly, with a gently curious eye. This fascinating approach begs for more imitation.", "Ryan gives a career redefining performance.", "Weak plot with grisly middle; should've been NC-17.", "A failed thriller, if a thriller it was intended to be. But it is a great success as... a study of female sexual psychology in a world of hypermasculine violence.", "Dull, derivative, nonsensical and pretentious."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "2/4", "", "", "", "", "", "C+", "", "", "", "2/5", "7/10", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Joshua Rothkopf", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Bradley Steinbacher", "SMH Staff", "Philip French", "Sukhdev Sandhu", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Dennis King", "Sr. Rose Pacatte", "Brian D.
