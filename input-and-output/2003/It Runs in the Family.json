It Runs In the Family knows the words, but not the music. . .", "To show up to the set everyday must have been a chore in itself, but to actually read some of these lines and play some of these scenes with the little-to-no direction they seem to have received is a sign of true dedication.", "Endearing moments battle with forced melodrama to produce a muddled family portrait both tiresome and tender.", "Doesn't even rise to the level of a daytime soap opera.", "By the end of the film we also expect some closure; satisfaction in knowing that the Gromberg family is going to be okay. This conclusion never comes and we are left wondering whether the family will indeed persevere.", "", "", "A funny, articulate, imperfect, sometimes messy, often infuriatingly sentimental, but always caring and spirited movie.", "There are enough genuine moments amidst its TV movie trappings.", "One might rightly ask what runs in this family; based on the evidence here, it's nepotism.
