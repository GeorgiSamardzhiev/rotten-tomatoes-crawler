{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When popular singer Dino (Dean Martin) stops for gas in a small town near Las Vegas, mechanic Barney (Cliff Osmond) disables his car. Barney, who writes songs with local teacher Orville (Ray Walston), wants Dino to sing some of their compositions. Orville invites Dino over, but sends his wife, Zelda (Felicia Farr), away so Dino can't hit on her. He then hires prostitute Polly (Kim Novak) to play his wife.
