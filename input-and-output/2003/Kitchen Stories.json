{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the 1950s, a team of Swedish researchers plans to revolutionize the home kitchen. After observing the modern housewife, they set their sights on typical bachelors. Scientist Folke (Tomas Norstr\u00f6m) is sent to a rural Norwegian town, where he tracks the kitchen behavior of odd single man Isak (Joachim Calmeyer). Folke is under strict orders to avoid personal interactions with his subject at all costs, but despite warnings from his superiors, he strikes up a strange camaraderie with Isak.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Bent Hamer", "studio": "BOBFilmSwedenAB,BulbulFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 27, 2016", "box_office": "$349.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The charm and chemistry of the two leads and subtle, wry moments of humor make for an endearing entertainment.", "", "", "Not the sort of film you'd want a steady diet of, but as a change of pace from the ordinary, it's well worth a look.", "An ingeniously dry and bittersweet comedy about that 1940s and '50s research.", "One of those rare winning exceptions to the axiom that movies should move, this one shows what advantage can be earned when men of good will sit still together.", "A prime piece of comic anthropology.", "What you're left with is a relationship between two men that is untouched by macho posturing or any trace of anxiety -- and a perfect respite from the action flick mentality.", "What starts as a satire of the methodical, modernity-seeking society in Sweden ends as a heartwarming dramatic comedy in Norway.", "", "A thoroughly charming oddity.
