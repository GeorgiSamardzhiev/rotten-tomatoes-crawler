{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Bulcs\u00fa (S\u00e1ndor Cs\u00e1nyi) is a subway enforcement officer working in the oppressively gray underground transit system in Hungary, whose job consists of ensuring commuters have paid to ride the train. A quirky young woman (Eszter Balla) catches his eye, and their relationship suggests that Bulcs\u00fa might escape from the drudgery of his subterranean life and finally see sunlight again. But first he needs to find out why passengers are jumping -- or being pushed -- to their deaths onto the tracks.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Art House & International/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Nimr\u00f3d Antal", "studio": "Bonfire", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 24, 2019", "box_office": "$2.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "It's not a perfect film by any means, but it certainly succeeds quite well in telling its tale with enough charm and gore to keep thing interesting.", "Even though we spend the entire film underground, Hungary has never looked more buoyant.", "Though the film is crowd-pleasing enjoyable, it never fully brings in enough light to its underground setting to completely satisfy as a fully realized work.", "[A] nimble dark comedy.", "This is supremely confident filmmaking for a newcomer, and should give Antal a one-way ticket to bigger things.", "Antal proudly wears Tarantino influences, lingering in humorous conversations that race out on tangents, adding flavor to characters while also subtly developing themes.", "Antal has a bright future.", "", "Os personagens e o prprio conceito do filme so interessantes, mas o fraco roteiro acaba desperdiando o potencial do projeto e a boa direo do estreante Antal.", "You don't need a deep, dark forest to tell an unsettling fable about the struggle for freedom or the battles waged between the shadows and the things that glow.", "The constant gear-changing -- or tonal shifts -- may put some audience members off a bit. But it also has style to burn, and most of the cast is appealing, especially the brooding Csanyi, and Balla, whose sunny presence brightens up the dark proceedings.", "Writer-director Nimrod Antal shifts from breakneck action to thoughtful romance ..., as he reveals a colorful and chaotic underground.", "As a group of episodes, the movie keeps our interest not by linear plot, but by finely drawn characterizations.", "Debut writer-director Nimrd Antal uses the anti-hero Bulcs (Sndor Csnyi) as an effective symbol of repressed rebellion.", "You might wonder at the end what happened to the plot, but the mood, characters and look are so striking that you really won't miss it.", "Kontroll throws beaucoup intriguing mysteries at us, but the solutions aren't worth the trip.", "[S]elf-assured, totally enrapturing... makes you realize how few directors achieve such a necessary confidence in their own hocus pocus...", "Were it not for the subtitles, it would be virtually guaranteed instant cult status", "Antal keenly juggles black comedy, character types and genre styles, making the most of the weird angles and inherent dark creepiness of his chosen backdrop."], "rating": ["4/5", "B", "", "B-", "", "3.5/4", "3/4", "3/4", "4/5", "3/5", "3/4", "3/4", "3/4", "4/5", "3/4", "3.5/5", "2/4", "", "", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Roger Moore", "Jason Gorber", "Bruce Feld", "Dennis Schwartz", "Steve Schneider", "Rob Thomas", "Phil Villarreal", "Michele Kenner", "Marrit Ingman", "Pablo Villa\u00e7a", "Lisa Kennedy", "Jeff Vice", "Sean P.
