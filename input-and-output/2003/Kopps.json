At first, the plan is a smashing success. But problems arise when another cop, hot-headed Benny (Torkel Petersson), who doesn't know about Jacob and Lasse's plot, begins to investigate the pseudo-crime spree.", "rating": "80", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 31m", "director": "Josef Fares", "studio": "FilmiV\u00e4st", "theater_date": "Jan 24, 2003", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "Occasionally strays into areas we've seen covered in Supertroopers, but it's a far better and much more consistently funny film.", ""], "rating": ["1/4", "7/10", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Chris Hewitt", "Jon Popick", "Collin Souter"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">St. Paul Pioneer Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Planet S Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com"], "date": ["July 23, 2004", "April 9, 2004", "November 20, 2003"]}}
