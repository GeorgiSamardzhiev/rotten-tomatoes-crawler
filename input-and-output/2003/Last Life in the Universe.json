{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Lonely librarian Kenji (Tadanobu Asano) flees Japan to avoid Yakuza who have mistakenly targeted him. He ends up in Bangkok, where isolation and anxiety have pushed him to the brink of suicide. Unexpectedly, he meets free-spirited bar hostess Noi (Sinitta Boonyasak), who is dealing with her sister's recent death. The marijuana-loving Noi is nothing like the perpetually nervous Kenji, yet they form an odd bond over their sadnesses. But Kenji doesn't know the Yakuza have followed him to Bangkok.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Pen-Ek Ratanaruang", "studio": "BohemianFilms,Cinemasia", "theater_date": "Apr 22, 2004", "dvd_date": "Feb 15, 2005", "box_office": "$31.7K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Un film dont les \u00e9lans singuliers m\u00e8nent \u00e0 la fascination.", "One fascinating -- if not wholly accessible -- movie.", "Asano \u00e9 sempre um ator interessante, mas a montagem \u00e9 auto-indulgente e o roteiro, pretensioso.", "Macabre film about a suicidal librarian.", "A film that demands second and even third viewings in order to absorb all of its nuances.", "This trip-hoppy tone poem left me feeling like I'd never seen a movie before.", "... a dreamy study in stillness broken by suicide fantasies, flashbacks, and the hired killers, but even the violence has a meditative even melancholy quality to it...", "It's an offbeat romance that defies easy labeling, recommendable as a film buff's pleasure and a semi-audacious art-house curio.", "[Reflects] the growing interpenetration of many individual national cinemas into a cultural conglomerate that reflects the irresistible tide of cinematic globalization.", "The film has a precise, slow pace that allows us to get to know these quiet, quirky characters, and an imaginatively experimental approach to their thoughts and dreams.", "An absorbing series of intricately planned shots that play like installation art at a modern museum.", "Constantly surprising.", "There is some lovely filmmaking here, and nice surprises.", "This arthouse drama could have used less concept and more focused storytelling.", "The Thai locales, the stars and Doyle's expressive cinematography add up to a disarmingly seductive yet always precarious film experience.", "One of the year's most original and compelling releases.", "a deeply intriguing and contemplative two-person character study that offers many small rewards along the way", "A brilliantly atmospheric, sweetly nutty film.", "...rests entirely on Asano's performance, and he doesn't disappoint.", ""], "rating": ["8/10", "4/5", "2/5", "A", "", "", "B+", "2.5/4", "", "4/4", "3/4", "3.5/4", "3/4", "2/4", "4/5", "3.5/5", "3.5/5", "", "", "B"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Vandeuren", "Ken Hanke", "Pablo Villa\u00e7a", "Dennis Schwartz", "Matt Bailey", "Andrew Wright", "Sean Axmaker", "Jeff Shannon", "Andrew Sarris", "G.
