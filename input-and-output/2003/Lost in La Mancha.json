{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Visionary director Terry Gilliam has a dream. He wants to film the classic story of Don Quixote by recasting it as a trippy, time-traveling, mistaken-identity adventure with Johnny Depp as Quixote. After struggling for years to get financing, insurance and a cast in place, Gilliam travels to Spain and promptly watches his dream fall apart. From flash floods to cast no-shows to serious injuries, Gilliam and his crew suffer one setback after another.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Documentary/Musical & Performing Arts/Television", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Keith Fulton, Louis Pepe", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 4, 2017", "box_office": "$731.6K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A gem ... for all those that love the movies, even the ones that don't get made.", "Anyone who thinks making movies is easy needs to see this hilariously painful cautionary tale.

Those who are not real film fans or film students probably won't find it as interesting.", "Seeing Gilliam's vision falter is simply painful and joyless.", "Viewers always seem to have a strange curiosity about disasters.", "This is a lively film, as optimistic in tone as Don Quixote is in character. And Terry Gilliam is a bright, expansive and enthusiastic filmmaker, a likeable, charismatic guy who jokes about having a budget of US$31.5 million being \"half the money we need\"", "The only person who has jousted at more windmills than Don Quixote seems to be Terry Gilliam.", "Wondrous document of a film gone wrong and an artist who inspires fans, cast and crew, even as he terrifies financiers, insurers and anyone more firmly footed in filmmaking reality.", "If something about you causes you to root for Terry Gilliam too, you should definitely seek this film out", "Lost In La Mancha will have you alternately wincing, laughing and, finally, weeping at the thought that we may never see this potentially brilliant movie.", "Filled with humor and human drama, this La Mancha is an intriguing place for film lovers to get lost.", "A fascinating record of how the movie fell apart, piece by piece, with everything short of a natural disaster conspiring against the filmmaker.", "Unique, fascinating, funny and sad.", "A fascinating study in the cinematic arts, as we watch a talented director and a committed crew and cast thwarted by nature, human failings and just plain bad luck."], "rating": ["", "", "3/4", "A", "4/5", "B+", "3/5", "", "B", "2/5", "B-", "", "3.5/4", "5/5", "", "3.5/4", "4/5", "3/4", "8/10", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Allen Almachar", "David Ansen", "Joe Lozito", "Jason Gorber", "", "Jeffrey Overstreet", "Jay Antani", "Martin Scribbs", "Robert Roten", "Jurgen Fauth", "Dennis Schwartz", "Urban Cinefile Critics", "Linda Cook", "Roger Moore", "Greg Dean Schmitz", "Collin Souter", "Gerry Shamray", "Rene Rodriguez", "Jack Garner", "Bill Muller"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Big Picture Big Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Scouts", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Looking Closer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Alternative", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Low IQ Canadian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Laramie Movie Scope", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">About.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Urban Cinefile", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Quad City Times (Davenport, IA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Greg&#39;s Previews at Yahoo!
