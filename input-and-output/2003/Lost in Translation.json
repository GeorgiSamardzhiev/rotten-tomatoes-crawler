{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A lonely, aging movie star named Bob Harris (Bill Murray) and a conflicted newlywed, Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson), meet in Tokyo. Bob is there to film a Japanese whiskey commercial; Charlotte is accompanying her celebrity-photographer husband. Strangers in a foreign land, the two find escape, distraction and understanding amidst the bright Tokyo lights after a chance meeting in the quiet lull of the hotel bar. They form a bond that is as unlikely as it is heartfelt and meaningful.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Sofia Coppola", "studio": "AmericanZoetrope,ElementalFilms", "theater_date": "Sep 19, 2003", "dvd_date": "Jun 15, 2012", "box_office": "$44.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Murray, playing an extension of himself, fills the role with ease, and Johansson is right in step with him.", "What Coppola presents is something akin to a mindfulness session - the art of being present in the moment.", "I can never remember the plot, but who cares. The emotional throughline is crystal clear.", "...its pretty images of Tokyo and oddball intergenerational friendship coalesce into something unexpectedly moving...", "Like her debut film, The Virgin Suicides, Coppola creates a beautiful-looking film with depth and texture, along with a couple of outstanding performances from its lead actors.", "A marvellous, exquisite movie.", "Sofia Coppola's sophomore film (following the gently assured The Virgin Suicides) is another exploration of delicate relationships and uncommunicated frustrations, this one in a beautifully composed atmosphere of isolation.", "Depicts a very specific mental state too shaded and delicate for most movies to feel comfortable approaching it.", "Excellent but mature film about finding a connection.", "A relationship picture with elegant connective tissue; it's brittle and real, focused on the nuances of body language and unspoken desire, while indulging in a cheeky bit of knowing absurdity when the mood strikes.", "...a deceptively simple study in unrequited attraction that succeeds in spite of minor problems with neglected sub-plots.", "An excellent top notch gem with beautiful direction courtesy of Sofia Coppola...", "Wonderfully warm and witty.", "Lost in Translation revels in contradictions. It's a comedy about melancholy, a romance without consummation, a travelogue that rarely hits the road.", "Very much a mood piece, the film's deft balance of humor and poignancy makes it both a pleasurable and melancholy experience.", "Transcends its initial culture clash comic riffs to evolve into something altogether more moving by the end. As a result, it's a work of considerable power and pathos.", "With this film it becomes clear that Sofia Coppola is a filmmaker with eyes all her own.", "Working this time with her own story, Coppola lets it relax and breathe, devoting herself to moods and moments.", "This is another step in Mr. Murray's career and one that hopefully gets him the recognition he deserves.", "The whole tale is told with a dreamy, jet-lagged feel, that part wonder, part nasueous feeling brought about by significant travel. Jet lag as a metaphor for love, a delicious combination. Simply a must-see film."], "rating": ["4/4", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "", "8/10", "5/5", "A", "B+", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "3.5/5", "", "5/5", "3.5/4", "A"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tom Meek", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "CJ Sheu", "Joshua Rothkopf", "Micheal Compton", "Neil Norman", "Sean Axmaker", "Tim Brayton", "Nell Minow", "Brian Orndorf", "Cole Smithey", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Urban Cinefile Critics", "Richard Corliss", "David Rooney", "James Mottram", "David Ansen", "Rob Gonsalves", "Joe Lozito", "Jason Gorber"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cambridge Day", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen Queens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Review Film Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">In These Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seanax.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Modamag.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Urban Cinefile", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Big Picture Big Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Scouts"], "date": ["October 9, 2020", "July 16, 2020", "July 1, 2020", "March 16, 2020", "November 15, 2019", "January 11, 2018", "February 12, 2016", "July 29, 2013", "December 25, 2010", "December 28, 2009", "June 13, 2009", "April 29, 2009", "October 18, 2008", "October 5, 2008", "October 5, 2008", "October 5, 2008", "November 1, 2007", "August 13, 2007", "July 14, 2007", "June 21, 2007"]}}
