{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Convinced of his irresistible appeal to women, Texas dishwasher Joe Buck (Jon Voight) quits his job and heads for New York City, thinking he'll latch on to some rich dowager. New York, however, is not as hospitable as he imagined, and Joe soon finds himself living in an abandoned building with a Dickensian layabout named Enrico \"Ratso\" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). The two form a rough alliance, and together they kick-start Joe's hustling career just as Ratso's health begins to deteriorate.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "John Schlesinger", "studio": "FlorinProductions,JeromeHellmanProductions", "theater_date": "May 25, 1969", "dvd_date": "Jan 11, 2016", "box_office": "$201.0K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Some people thought Dustin Hoffman's performance in The Graduate was a fluke, or a bit of lucky typecasting. Not so. In Mid- night Cowboy Hoffman clearly emerges as a tragic comedian in the tradition of (can we say it, yes), of Chaplin.", "...a more hyperbolic ode to male loserdom...", "Boasts an outstanding soundtrack by John Barry and Harry Nilsson, which coordinates uplifting and upbeat tunes to wonderfully contrast the main characters' weighty situations.", "Midnight Cowboy has two of the best performances of the year, by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, but also some of the worst direction.", "A striking time capsule, and this includes its most broken and misjudged moments as well as its strongest.", "Though Schiesinger's method constantly undermines the individuality of his displaced heroes, it is a reflection on the superb and largely unsentimental performances of both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman that one cares almost too much about them.", "Joe's past has been an emotional vacuum, lacking belief, moral training, friends, adult models of identification: all the components that feed personality... You can't use techniques suggestive of human complexity to suggest the lack of it.", "John Schlesinger's confident direction brings out a side of New York City that had been largely ignored by cinema since the films noirs of the Forties.", "A marvel.", "Schlesinger's camera discovers everywhere something rarely glimpsed in Hollywood movies - poverty.", "For a street opera with incongruous inspirations and mix-and-match aspirations, Midnight Cowboy is startlingly accomplished.", "More than the grime and the weirdos, more than \"Everybody's Talkin'\" and \"I'm walkin' here!,\" what echoes through the decades is its poignant depiction of an unlikely, contentious, and yet weirdly tender friendship forged on the margins of society.", "Midnight Cowboy features two of cinema's most indelible losers.", "John Schlesinger presents a particularly un-pretty picture of the New York underworld as Voight's American dream shatters into a thousand psychedelic pieces.", "Along the same lines, don't tell me about how superbly a film provokes the bourgeoisie or portrays the bleakness of life unless it does so at least as effectively as Midnight Cowboy.", "A pair of performances of the highest calibre: funny, sensitive and finely adjusted to indicate the abject simple- mindedness that is their constant tripwire.", "Some of the attitudes in Midnight Cowboy -- especially toward women -- don't wear the years well, but the performances by Hoffman and Jon Voight remain electric.", "Even with every foot of grim realism and some humor, Midnight Cowboy is rather a sad picture.", "No amount of obfuscation can obscure the film's vaulting performances.", "Midnight Cowboy moves beyond realism into an archetypal tale of the Big City destroying dreamers. Joe and Ratso, like Of Mice and Men's George and Lenny, are quintessential failed, lower-class, buddy-dreamers."], "rating": ["", "", "1", "", "3/5", "", "", "4.5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "4/5", "", "", "5/5", "8/10", "", "", "3/4", "", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Harvey G.
