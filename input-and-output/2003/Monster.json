Her fierce, hauntingly vulnerable, Academy Award-winning performance shows us who Aileen Wuornos really was.", "Jenkins's Monster tells the story of victimisation and re-victimisation through Aileen Wuornos.", "Powerful, painful for mature audiences only.", "By \"Monster's\" end, nothingness replaces Aileen Wuornos' ferocity - evidence of exhaustive efforts from Patty Jenkins and Oscar-winner Charlize Theron to emphasize this serial killer's fraying sanity, not her crimes' sensationalism.", "The film's worth seeing for Charlize Theorn's stunning performance, based on complete physical and psychological transformation, but as a dramatic feature, it lacks an interesting perspective and is underpopulated in terms of characters.", "Charlize Theron gives her finest performance yet in the unlikely role of serial killer Aileen Wuornos in this riveting depiction of the Florida prostitute's decent into madness.", "Theron is the most convincing actress to play Aileen Wuornos ever and really dives into the role...", "Theron makes Aileen realistically frightening and unreachable at times.
