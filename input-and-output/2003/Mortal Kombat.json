Why? Obviously because the filmmakers have really tried to offer some eye-popping visuals that can provide the same stimuli as the video game itself.", "Bad actors in lead roles, sometimes poor fight choreography and extremely dated special effects, MK isn't a good film, but it does make for a good laugh with friends!", "Unlike other games-inspired turkeys (Super Mario Bros, Street Fighter), this one actually works, thanks mainly to director Paul Anderson's single-minded dedication to nonstop, expertly choreographed martial arts action, all set to a thumping techno beat.", "One of its main attractions is, in effect, the way in which it works with the visual and interactive aspects of the videogame, trying to incorporate all this into a totally different product. [Full Review in Spanish]", "A martial arts action-adventure with wondrous special effects and witty production design, it effectively combines supernatural terror, a mythical slay-the-dragon, save-the-princess odyssey and even a spiritual quest for self-knowledge.", "It's a movie rife with mullets, gratuitous gymnastics, screamed lines, and terrible CGI. But it all just contributes to the charm.", "This is a Mortal Kombat movie made for Mortal Kombat fans.", "A fun, visually appealing film with effective performances and well choreographed fights. [Full review in Spanish]", "Cheesy and very violent adaptation of '90s video game.", "The guys in the recording studio who made the ooofff! augghhhh! sounds are the ones who really had all the fun.", "Hardly award-worthy entertainment, and pretty visually dated, but probably one of the better video game movies ever made comparatively.", "...a one-note gimmick that comes with everything but a joystick for the viewer to control the robotic characters.", "In the realm of movies adapted from video games, \"Mortal Kombat\" sucks the least...", "We'll concede that four-armed Prince Goro is a hoot, Christopher Lambert looks fabulous in a flowing white wig, and Talisa Soto, who plays some kind of princess, can lord it over us anytime.", "Anderson does a good job of edging humour into dumbness - Lambert gets a few witty looks - and the art direction and effects are okay.", "Where others have sunk in the mire of imitation, director Paul Anderson and writer Kevin Droney effect a viable balance between exquisitely choreographed action and ironic visual and verbal counterpoint.", "cheesy but still, kick ass", "British director Anderson does a fair job with what he was given: four good-looking leads, some very impressive sfx, Babylonian sets, a bone-crunching soundtrack, and a battery of well-choreographed fights.", ""], "rating": ["2/10", "3/4", "3/5", "3/5", "2/5", "", "", "", "3/4", "1/5", "C+", "6/10", "4/10", "", "2.5/4", "3/5", "", "2.5/4", "", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Gene Siskel", "David Hogan", "John Ferguson", "Pilar Cuesta", "Kevin Thomas", "Dan Seitz", "Jeremy Jahns", "Sebastian Zavala Kahn", "Brian Costello", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "R.L.
