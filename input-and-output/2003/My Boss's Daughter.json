{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A misunderstanding leads Tom Stansfield (Ashton Kutcher), a mild-mannered publishing house employee, to house-sit for his boss, Jack Taylor (Terence Stamp), instead of Jack's daughter, Lisa (Tara Reid), who goes partying. While Lisa is away, her older brother hides some drugs in the bathroom, which the family's pet owl ingests, causing it to behave erratically. Lisa comes home and starts to take a liking to Tom, but the situation is interrupted by an upset drug dealer and other mayhem.", "rating": "8", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 26m", "director": "David Zucker", "studio": "DimensionFilms", "theater_date": "Aug 22, 2003", "dvd_date": "May 23, 2016", "box_office": "$15.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Everything about this film stinks.", "Painfully awkward and out of sync from the first scene, in which Kutcher, horribly miscast as a big dork, swoons over Tara Reid, horribly miscast as a dreamy love interest.", "The only real physical comedy in My Boss's Daughter comes from Zucker, Dorfman, and Kutcher stumbling over each other, but it's unlikely anyone will laugh.", "The real disaster is the slapstick-ridden script, which a great supporting cast is powerless to salvage.", "A pretty good cast and a pretty good director are pretty much wasted in My Boss's Daughter.", "My Boss's Daughter is a stinker from start to endless finish.", "Kutcher comedy is crude, offensive, and all-around bad.", "Comedy's cardinal rule is never make it look hard, but that wisdom is ignored in My Boss's Daughter.", "The direction of David Zucker is as uninspired and numbing as the script.", "I believe in a movie's right to die.", "The spectacularly unfunny supporting cast -- including Dave Foley, Jeffrey Tambor and David Koechner -- doesn't help either. But luckily Kutcher is there to try to clean up the mess.", "Few films are as consistently pathetic.", "I don't rate this at the bottom of the barrel because the film does have a few funny moments. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone with the slightest inclination to good taste.", "...not as bad as you might think...", "This cute and often surprising comedy is a brazen bid to clone Meet The Parents and it succeeds beyond this reviewer's worst fears.", "Kutcher and Reid not only don't light up the screen, they put out the candles.", "Ashton Kutcher and Tara Reid belong on magazine covers. In John Zucker's My Boss's Daughter, however, the fetching pair are plucked from their natural habitat and forced to attempt acting.", "Some of the worst acting in a movie in 2003.", "The simple premise pushes credibility beyond breaking point as ridiculous situations increase in number and size.", "It should have been called \"My Boss's House\" because there was very little focus on the boss's hot daughter."], "rating": ["", "", "", "1/4", "1.5/4", "0.5/5", "1/5", "", "1/5", "", "", "D-", "2/10", "2.5/4", "", "3/10", "0.5/4", "1/4", "1/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Heather Havrilesky", "Scott Tobias", "M.
