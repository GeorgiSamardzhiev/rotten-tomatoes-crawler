{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Dae-Su is an obnoxious drunk bailed from the police station yet again by a friend. However, he's abducted from the street and wakes up in a cell, where he remains for the next 15 years, drugged unconscious when human contact is unavoidable, otherwise with only the television as company. And then, suddenly released, he is invited to track down his jailor with a denouement that is simply stunning.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 58m", "director": "Chan-wook Park", "studio": "EggFilms,ShowEast", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 1, 2017", "box_office": "$707.4K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Hailed as one of the top ten movies in the history of Asian cinema, it's hard to suggest Oldboy should not be on that list.", "Culminates in such outlandish morbidity that it's difficult to admire as a competent whole.", "A powerful and smart ode to tragedy, Park's film manages to provoke you, dishearten you, and thrill you.", "Oldboy still stands up as a modern revenge masterpiece, full of extreme violence and brutal shocks but with heart and a story that draws you in and keeps you invested with every twist and turn.", "Still holds up as a true tour de force that is just as fresh and hard-hitting in 2019 as it was upon its release 16 years ago.", "Oldboy is so much more than an action film; it takes the viewer on a journey through a life destroyed, rebuilt and abolished once more. It teaches us lessons about consequences from our actions, the need to get revenge and find truth...", "Oldboy has more to offer than action and violence - it's an imaginative tale of guilt and revenge, with a shocking climax that will live long in the memory.", "When it was first released back in 2003 Park Chan-wook's Oldboy hit audiences like a hammer. Forget Spike Lee's 2013 US remake with Josh Brolin, this South Korean film is the only version of Oldboy that needs to be seen.", "Bold, brutal, bloody and brilliant", "A lurid, complex, introspective beast, enacting astonishing cruelty on its protagonist like a slow-acting poison.", "Gorgeous cinematography, powerful writing, and bravura sequences", "The humiliation and ensuing catharsis are the primary concepts, and revenge, which creates chain reactions of hatred, is solely an element of the set, with the focus being on vengeance not as an act, but the reasons that lead to it and its consequences", "A story of revenge served both hot and cold, this is a heady mix of eye-popping fighting, deadpan humour, graphic torture and grungy cinematography.", "A jaw-dropping seminal masterwork, blending heart-wrenching physical and emotional brutality.", "Great but extremely brutal, vicious revenge story.", "..seems to be about the awfulness and inhumanity of vengeance. But watch how the film moves.", "Vengeance here's a clever, evolving beast. Dae-su's guardian-like enemy stokes his bloodlust, embittering the free man's returning love of life. The climax is a scarlet swelling into Greek tragedy as truth, reprisal and justice smear.", "Both brutal and lyrical, writer-director Park Chan-wook's existential nail-biter has torture scenes that will have you avoiding dentists, sushi bars and badly appointed hotel rooms.", "Shakespearean in its violence, Oldboy also calls up nightmare images of spiritual and physical isolation that are worthy of Samuel Beckett or Dostoyevsky.", "Banzai-violence kin to \"Cast Away\" about a man at time's cruel whim, \"Oldboy\"is an endurance test worth taking. Its conclusion is the most sadistic and destructively wrathful since \"Seven,\" and the point of no return has rarely shocked this much."], "rating": ["5/5", "7/10", "", "", "1", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "", "", "4.5/5", "5/5", "4/5", "0.5/4", "", "5/5", "", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tony Black", "Mike Massie", "Michael Frank", "Chris Ward", "Andrew Pollard", "Zoe Rose Smith", "Brian Pendreigh", "Niall Browne", "Rob Aldam", "Kambole Campbell", "C.J.
