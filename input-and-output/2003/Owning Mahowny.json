{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Toronto bank employee Dan Mahowny (Philip Seymour Hoffman) seems like an honest man to his coworkers and loving girlfriend, Belinda (Minnie Driver). None of them realize that he is actually a compulsive gambler who steals from the bank's accounts to pay off his bookie, Frank (Maury Chaykin), and fund regular trips to casinos. Sleazy casino boss Victor (John Hurt) encourages Dan to amass more and more debt, until the missing money becomes hard to hide, and Dan's life spirals out of control.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Richard Kwietniowski", "studio": "AllianceAtlantisCommunications", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2018", "box_office": "$1.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The drama is a narrow, one-way street. And Hoffman is no Russell Crowe or Leonardo DiCaprio. He's just a brilliant American actor playing a repressed Canadian with a weakness for numbers.", "", "what was fascinating character study becomes banal and unconvincing cautionary tale", "...a movie that rejects the pyrotechnics, glamour and spectacle-mongering of mainstream Hollywood yet manages to engage, connect and transfix.", "Watching Hoffman completely give himself over to his addiction is pretty draining. Although the film has a subtext ... it's basically a ride down to the bottom with an addict.", "The flick's absolutely worth seeing for Hoffman's performance alone, but there's also enough Casino / Heist goodness to keep you entertained.", "Atmospheric and never flashy, and yet capable of moments of unbearable tension and an almost overpowering sense of paranoia.", "Hoffman, sempre um ator interessante, oferece uma atuao digna dos grandes nomes da 7 Arte, como Brando, De Niro e Sean Penn.", "This is the fascinating thing about the movie, how Mahowny marches off to his doom, totally distracted from his fate by the thrill of gambling.", "", "Philip Seymour Hoffman is like a stack of pure Inca gold in the world of thespian addicts - a world I dwell happily in...", "Surprisingly upbeat story based, in part, on the real-life adventures of gambling addict Brian Moloney. While it's interesting, it's seldom affecting.", "You can bet on Philip Seymour Hoffman.", "Whether or not you think of gambling as a vice, you can bet on Owning Mahowny.", "A stark and revealing film that's as moving as it is disquieting.", "Hoffman makes it impossible for us not to watch and not to enjoy it all on some subliminal level.", "...this human car wreck methodically spins itself out with agonizing inevitability...that the film is also quite funny is an unexpected bonus.", "This film felt more like a Canadian 'TV Movie of the Week' than anything.", "Hoffman gorgeously captures the plight of the hopeless gambling addict.", "When Hoffman steps from the shower, the blond spitcurl plastered to his forehead increases his resemblance to a big, pathetic Kewpie doll.
