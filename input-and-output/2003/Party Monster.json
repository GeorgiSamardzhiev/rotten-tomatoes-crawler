{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this film based on a true story, Michael Alig (Macaulay Culkin) arrives on a Greyhound bus in New York City desperate to leave his boring Midwestern past behind. After meeting downtown club kid James St. James (Seth Green) and influential nightclub owner Peter Gatien (Dylan McDermott), a fame-hungry Alig decides to throw the most controversial and over-the-top parties in the city. In just a few years Alig's drug addiction and erratic behavior threaten to destroy the empire he's created.", "rating": "29", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Fenton Bailey", "studio": "KillerFilms,WorldofWonder,ContentFilm", "theater_date": "Sep 5, 2003", "dvd_date": "Mar 23, 2017", "box_office": "$668.1K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There isn't an ounce of genuine affection on display.", "... shows that there's a lot more to this sordid story than first meets the jaundiced eye.", "", "", "", "Rule No. 1: If you use black humor in a film about real-life characters and events, make sure you have a feel for it first.", "", "Culkin se esfora, mas no convence como o bissexual Michael Alig.
