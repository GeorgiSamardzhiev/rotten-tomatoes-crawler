[Blu-ray]", "\"Paycheck\" is a no-brainer action movie with just enough sci-fi thematic input to keep it spicy.", "Most of it is very predictable and so obvious and instantly draws us away from the characters because everything here feels very artificial and very staged.", "For those who enjoy a ripper of a good yarn, Paycheck is good value.", "Some remedial script work is in need, and the characters are far from compelling. But the action is up to scratch and it rattles happily along.", "There's a sense of treading water about this movie.", "It's nice to know that there's a director out there who still knows how to use marquee stars and to blow stuff up real good, without resorting to CGI fakery.", "Paycheck is John Woo lite.", "A mildly entertaining slice of science fiction that's anchored by some top-notch action.", "The film discards serious discussion for Mexican standoffs and action scenes, trading the possibility of complex rewards for simple pleasures.", "", "", "This could have been a terrific movie.
