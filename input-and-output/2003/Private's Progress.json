{"metadata": {"synopsis": "As World War II settles over England, university student Stanley Windrush (Ian Carmichael) receives his call-up. During training, Windrush is plunged into a thoroughly unfamiliar world, with his leading officer, Maj. Hitchcock, more apt to be found in a pub than on the base. There's also Pvt. Percy Fox (Richard Attenborough), a cunning working-class type always on the make, and the cold and crafty Bertram Tracepurcel (Dennis Price). All are being trained for an unusual mission inside Germany.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "John Boulting", "studio": "BoultingBrothers,BritishLionFilmCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's unlikely to aid recruiting in the Old Country but it's shrewdly designed to give audiences everywhere a pretty hilarious time."], "rating": [""], "fresh": ["fresh"], "critic": ["Clyde Gilmour"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Maclean&#39;s Magazine"], "date": ["November 7, 2019"]}}
