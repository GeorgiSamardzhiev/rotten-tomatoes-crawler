{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The Ristuccias are a seemingly happy Italian family. However, when long-gestating aspirations and forgotten passions bubble to the surface, the family's domestic peace is threatened. The father, Carlo (Fabrizio Bentivoglio), is weary of his insurance job and longs to be a writer; his wife, Giulia (Laura Morante), is a literature professor but would rather be an actress. These innocent if secret desires take a turn for the worse when Carlo begins an affair with an old flame (Monica Bellucci).", "rating": "55", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 4m", "director": "Gabriele Muccino", "studio": "ViceVersaFilm,Fandango,MedusaProduzione,Telepi\u00f9,RaiCinema", "theater_date": "Sep 3, 2004", "dvd_date": "May 22, 2017", "box_office": "$15.4K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "small-minded and shallow", "Gabriele Muccino essentially subjects the audience to what Giulia subjects her family to in the film: a lot of unnecessary drama.", "The film works as a slice of life but has nothing valuable to say about people or the way they conduct their relationships.", "The glimpses of human behavior feel genuine.", "Even Monica Bellucci as Carlo's former girlfriend can't save it from mediocrity.", "I liked it; you may not. It may come down to your level of fascination with people who scream and gesture wildly in melodramatic Italian.", "It's an intriguing premise executed unintriguingly.", "The people in Remember Me, My Love evaporate the minute the lights come up.", "For such a downbeat story, the film is full of humor and vivacity. The characters, though frustrated and delusional, are fully realized by the exceptional cast.", "", "Gabriele Muccino cunningly plays his characters as a unit and as individuals, allowing for a continual series of dramatic vignettes.", "Remember Me, My Love is hard to forget.", "Remember Me, My Love might sound like a love story, but it makes romance look pretty bleak.", "A lively if overlong movie that allows for the full spectrum of human emotion and behavior.", "Achieves the dubious distinction of featuring a large gallery of nearly all unlikable characters.", "There just doesn't seem the need for this much needy self-absorption.", "The movie is being sold as a romance with the tag line: 'Some loves are never forgotten.' But the only love evident here is self-love, and the overall feel is disturbingly soulless.", "It's a narcissist's picnic; all of the characters are so unapologetically selfish in their passion to maximize their human potential that it's difficult to care about any of them, one way or another.", "If it were less prone to soap-opera histrionics, this screechy saga of an upscale family collapsing under the weight of its members' self-absorption might have something worth saying."], "rating": ["2/5", "3/5", "", "2/4", "3/5", "", "2.5/4", "2/4", "2.5/4", "", "C-", "3/4", "4/4", "B", "C+", "", "C", "2.5/4", "1/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mark Halverson", "Christopher Null", "Matt Kelemen", "Forrest Hartman", "Anthony Del Valle", "Jean Lowerison", "Michael Booth", "Carrie Rickey", "John Hartl", "Bill White", "Jack Garner", "Jeanne Aufmuth", "Ruthe Stein", "Mary F.
