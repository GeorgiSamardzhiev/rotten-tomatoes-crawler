{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Overly enthusiastic guitarist Dewey Finn (Jack Black) gets thrown out of his bar band and finds himself in desperate need of work. Posing as a substitute music teacher at an elite private elementary school, he exposes his students to the hard rock gods he idolizes and emulates -- much to the consternation of the uptight principal (Joan Cusack). As he gets his privileged and precocious charges in touch with their inner rock 'n' roll animals, he imagines redemption at a local Battle of the Bands.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Richard Linklater", "studio": "ParamountPictures,ScottRudinProductions", "theater_date": "Oct 3, 2003", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$81.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The concept by Mike White is paper thin and takes a while to move beyond [Jack] Black's manic mugging, but it all falls into rhythm for the big emotional guitar solo.", "School of Rock works despite its flaws. It's a film that proves when you get a lot of talented people together, you can overcome practically anything, including a familiar script.", "Thanks to Mike White's clever and witty script, Black is no longer relegated to being a goofy sidekick and successfully segues to center stage focusing in on his innate sense of musical mania.", "Black turns it up to 11 in every scene, throwing shapes, striking poses and zealously preaching the healing power of rock, never once selling-out to the threat of cute, kiddie-friendly fare.", "School of Rock just doesn't rock. It has no appetite for destruction. No raw power. It's like late Whitesnake. Tidied-up, over-produced. Jack Black is not, sad to say, Jack White.", "It's genuinely good hearted, and features child actors that look like real kids, all permeation of geeky, fat, skinny, sullen and silent in that way that only actual kids can be.", "It's great fun. It's like one of those inspirational sports movies where you want to stand up and cheer at the end.", "Standout Jack Black in nerd-becomes-cool comedy.", "Jack Black is a one-man rock 'n roll powerhouse in this infectious musical comedy directed by Gen X wunderkind Richard Linklater...", "Not only will your kids love this movie, but, hey, they'll learn what real music is.", "School of Rock made me laugh harder than any movie I've seen this year.", "It's another case of independent film artists beating Hollywood at its own game.", "As Dewey Finn, Mr. Black gets to capitalize on everything he does best -- basically being Jack Black. And loudly.", "The film that rocks your prep-school socks off.", "A cathartic class comedy for kids of all sizes, it's Bugsy Malone in rock pomp, Slacker meets Spy Kids.", "The best comedy to come around in years.", "One of the best comedies in years...the film never sells out to itself.", "Despite Black's reputation as a comedy anarchist, the movie has a big heart, avoids crude indulgence, and gives viewers of all ages something to enjoy.", "Good cast, good acting, good script, ridiculous premise, good music (if you like rock) equals entertaining movie.", "It's funny, it's heartfelt, and it just rocks!"], "rating": ["2.5/4", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "7/10", "4/5", "A-", "", "", "4/5", "3/4", "A-", "", "4/5", "A", "B-", "7/10", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tom Meek", "Micheal Compton", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Leigh Paatsch", "Antonia Quirke", "Dorothy Woodend", "John J.
