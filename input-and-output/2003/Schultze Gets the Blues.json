{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Salt miner Schultze (Horst Krause) is forced into retirement. He lapses into the boredom of his small German town. An accordion player, the retiree sometimes plays polkas, but it is not until he hears zydeco on the radio that he discovers a new inspiration and applies the fast tempo of zydeco to his accordion playing. But the town's polka scene frowns upon such deviation from tradition. Undaunted, Schultze packs his instrument and heads to zydeco's birthplace: the American South.", "rating": "71", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Michael Schorr", "studio": "ZweitesDeutschesFernsehen,FilmkombinatGmbH&amp;Co.KG", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 1, 2013", "box_office": "$594.1K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "A film with two opposite interpretations to its title -- figuratively sad, literally joyful.", "A delightful oddball German comedy about a retired mine worker's musical quest.", "Like the films of Jim Jarmusch and Aki Kaurismki, Schultze Gets the Blues uses dry humor to extract laughs out of mundane situations.", "Writer-director Michael Schorr's story moves with remarkable sloth.", "It's a bit of a surprise when the film ends and you realize that you've been touched in unanticipated ways by Schultze's solitary quest.", "...some predictable tearjerking that is only half-successful.", "He does, but you probably won't, especially from watching this movie.", "Krause, a natural physical comic, lights up with endearingly childish glee as he joyously samples his new life.", "An uncommonly good-natured and simple film, bearing no malice, holding no agenda, desiring no undue attention.", "When his friends send him off to America to his town's sister city of New Braunfels for Wurstfest, Schultze begins to spiral out of control.", "Those who are patient enough to stick it out will be charmed.", "The film's sparseness has an off-putting effect on the viewer. Schultze, the character, remains more an idea or concept than a fleshed-out human being.", "Like a lazy summer day in the Big Easy, the movie sneaks up on you.", "Though it sometimes seems nothing much is happening in Schultze Gets the Blues, watching it happen to the deadpan Schultze is surprisingly enjoyable.", "The geriatric, Teutonic equivalent of a Jim Jarmusch film.", "A delightful hodgepodge of bland and spicy fixin's and genuine pleasures and surprises that will definitely satisfy the cinematic palates of discriminating audiences.", "In his debut film, German writer-director Michael Schorr has crafted a deadpan and droll, yet lyrical, whale-out-of-water tale about defying peer pressure and self-limitations.", "Schultze's quiet determination in his musical quest gives the film an unexpected emotional punch.", "There's a pleasant delight in the comically dour faces of these old Eastern bloc men, an appreciation of sleepy small-town life in a quaint village."], "rating": ["1/5", "3/4", "4/5", "B-", "0/4", "", "", "4.5/5", "3/4", "B", "2/4", "3/4", "2.5/5", "B", "3/4", "3/4", "", "3/4", "B", "B+"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jim Lane", "Russ Breimeier", "Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat", "Mark Pfeiffer", "Forrest Hartman", "Robert W.
