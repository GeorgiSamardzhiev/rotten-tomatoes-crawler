{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This French drama depicts the lives of people who reside all year 'round in a small coastal town. Rose (Bulle Ogier) is a retired factory worker who spends much of her time at the nearby casino, and her son, Paul (Jonathan Zacca\u00ef), is a lifeguard on the beach. Meanwhile Paul's girlfriend, Marie (H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Filli\u00e8res), works at the same factory that employed his mother, reflecting the town's tininess. As the seasons pass, Rosie, Paul, Marie and other locals go through various changes.", "rating": "75", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Julie Lopes-Curval", "studio": "Miramax", "theater_date": "Aug 6, 2003", "dvd_date": "Jul 20, 2004", "box_office": "$14.8K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A poignant and often charming but always understated look at drifting lives.", "Poles-Curval balances the banal with the sublime in this simply remarkable and very French film.", "If you were lolling on the beach, casting your eyes at the scantily clad folks around you and overhearing bits of their conversations, it would be akin to the experience of watching Seaside.", "The film's simple beauty lies in the way that Lopes-Curval effortlessly equates life to a passing season.", "Along with Ms. Ogier, these four actresses [Fillires, Lizana, Mkal, Rovre] are the best reasons to see Seaside.", "Stifled passion isn't necessarily engaging, and by focusing on too many characters, it's tough to care about all of these drifting souls.", "Rarely does a filmmaker emerge so wholly formed, creating a miniature masterpiece first time out.", "Writer-director Julie Lopes-Curval's film is commendable for its resolute honesty in depicting unabating starkness in both scenery and existence, but cinematically galvanizing it's not.", "Seaside is splendid exploration of the power of place and the small changes that give our lives meaning.", "Director Julie Lopes-Curval's deeply thoughtful first feature explores the factors and forces, notably class difference, that determine the direction one's life takes.", "Effective, if less than urgent.", "Touching, amusing, sometimes compelling, Seaside is ultimately little more revealing than a weekend visit. It's a sheaf of captivating postcards.", "[Lopes-Curval's] achievement is so particularly -- and peculiarly -- realized, evoking the enforced parameters and rhythms of small-town life, that the movie itself begins to feels restrictive.", "The story is familiar and the direction doesn't break any new ground. Still, Lopes-Curval's excellent ensemble cast makes Seaside pleasurable viewing.", "Compare it to what passes for sophisticated filmmaking in this country and the movie becomes a living instrument of cinematic humanism.", "A lifeless film that drags an audience into the lives of a group of people in Cayeux, a coastal town in northern France, during the summer.
