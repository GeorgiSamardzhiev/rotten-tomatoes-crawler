{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A shy adolescent boy, Walter (Haley Joel Osment), is taken by his greedy mother (Kyra Sedgwick) to spend the summer with his two hard-boiled great-uncles, Hub (Robert Duvall) and Garth (Michael Caine), who are rumored to possess a great fortune. At first, the two old men, both set in their ways, find Walter's presence a nuisance, but they eventually warm up to the boy and regale him with tall tales from their past. In return, Walter helps reawaken their youthful spirit.", "rating": "60", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Tim McCanlies", "studio": "AveryPix,DigitalDomain,DavidKirschnerProductions", "theater_date": "Sep 26, 2003", "dvd_date": "Dec 1, 2012", "box_office": "$41.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A lovingly sweet tale.
