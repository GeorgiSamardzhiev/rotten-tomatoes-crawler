This is the way toward life, not away from it.", "However inferior it may be to La Terra Trema it can only strengthen Visconti's position as one of the major directors of the contemporary cinema.", "Not usually seen as one of the cinema's great romantics, Visconti with \"Senso\" made a film that both celebrated and mocked the very idea of romantic love, and the film remains resolutely itself after all these years.", "Senso is lush, broadly emotional and beautifully photographed.", "As usual with Visconti, there is a welter of baroque effects and an acute sense of history.", "Gorgeously upholstered by flashing, decadent passions and over-the-top operatics.", "Visconti's lush period piece, shot in color, marks his transition from neo-realism to grand operatic spectacles.", "Lavishly styled historical drama, which opens with one of the most electrifying protest scenes in film history.", "a Technicolored visual feast in the grandest tradition of historical-epic melodrama", "The culmination of Visconti's work, the perfect collision of style, themes and look, and perhaps his greatest film.", "Senso isn't the subtlest picture and its writing is frequently cringe-worthy. But as a work of pure film artistry it's wonderful, especially in its less motivated sequences.", "As a chronicle of doomed love, the story gains quite a bit of steam as it bulldozes towards its tragic ending.", "... this lush, lavish melodrama of a self-destructive love affair set against the idealistic passions of the Risorgimento is the very definition of cinematic.", "For any student of cinematography, costume design or art direction, Senso is an invaluable source of inspiration.", "Senso is an elegant, expensively-produced, period love story, set back in the Italian 1860s, and a stylist delight.", "Triumphs on the strength of [Alida Valli's] presence..you'd have to go very far to find a more luscious movie.", "Translates as sumptuous, hollow, overlong and dull.", "Visconti counterposes romance and rebellion in this historical tale of love and betrayal.", "Like other Visconti melodramas, [Senso is] sumptuous in its Technicolor expressionism.", ""], "rating": ["", "", "", "4/4", "3/5", "4/5", "A-", "", "4/4", "", "7.4/10", "6/10", "", "2.5/5", "", "9/10", "C+", "3.5/4", "", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Alain Tanner", "Kenneth Turan", "Roger Ebert", "Adrian Turner", "", "Emanuel Levy", "Michael E.
