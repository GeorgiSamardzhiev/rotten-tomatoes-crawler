There are none better in my book.", "The unstoppable joy of the musical numbers, especially with O'Connor, is what never fails to seduce - perhaps especially in Moses Supposes.", "Effervescent, life-affirming cinema... an antidote to any ailment, illness, or woes about the state of Hollywood.", "A masterpiece will always be a masterpiece, and it is very difficult to imagine that it may be possible to improve it in some way.
