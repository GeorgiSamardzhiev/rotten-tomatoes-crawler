{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In a documentary shot in waters all over the globe, director Dana Brown takes on tall waves and surfers who live to challenge them. The film treks from the Irish coast, where a trio of American brothers take on the Atlantic surf, to Rapa Nui in the Pacific, where the Easter Island statues gaze out at board-riding daredevils. Brown also finds good surfing in unlikely places, like Wisconsin and Texas, and charts the rise of female surfers in a sport traditionally dominated by males.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Documentary/Sports & Fitness", "runtime": "1h 27m", "director": "Dana Brown", "studio": "GothamGroup", "theater_date": "Aug 15, 2003", "dvd_date": "Jan 7, 2017", "box_office": "$3.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["All about the sights, which are glorious.", "[Brown] collects some fascinating stories.", "An awe-inspiring survey of global surf culture.", "Simple-minded though it is, it's wonderful entertainment.", "", "", "Some of the images are breathtaking, particularly the underwater shots looking up through the water to the surfers on the surface.", "Step Into Liquid is not only about passion, it demonstrates it through a deep and loving knowledge and respect for the subject matter.", "The cinematography is stunning, the camera so close to the surfer that it takes you inside the wave, beneath the falling crest.", "Produced with an insider's knowledge and affection, but surfing's moment as an exotic pop phenomenon with a big curiosity factor for landlubbers has passed...", "Absolutely unlike any documentary you've ever seen, Step Into Liquid nearly qualifies as a religious experience.", "A surfing documentary that offers a satisfactory amount of thrills within a tsunami of platitudes and hyperbole.", "A wonderful commercial for everything that makes surfing so enjoyable for many people.", "From start to finish, this documentary on the water-based board sport is filled with 'How did they do that?' moments.", "[Director Dana Brown's] random approach lacks focus, and the interviews with surf champs and hobbyists don't explain the surfing mystique.", "", "When Step Into Liquid remembers that it is indeed all about the wave, it pulls us right into it.", "If the narration gets a little hokey at times -- clich\u00e9d phrases are tossed out without much thought -- the interview subjects are refreshingly real, and you can't help but smile at their waterlogged wisdom.", "Between an entirely attractive cast of characters and stupendous, awe-inspiring cinematography, Step Into Liquid is wonderful entertainment.", "In any sport, whether it's whacking a ball into a cup or your opponent into submission, the majestic and the absurd are very close cousins, and Brown is generous enough here to give us a long look at both."], "rating": ["4/5", "", "", "7/10", "3/4", "3.5/5", "B", "", "3/5", "2.5/4", "4/5", "3/5", "7/10", "3.5/4", "2.5/4", "2/4", "3/5", "2.5/4", "3.5/5", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nell Minow", "J.
