{"metadata": {"synopsis": "While Liam (Martin Compston) waits for his mother to be released from prison, he aggressively resists the demands of his stepfather and grandfather that he use his mother as a drug mule. Liam dreams of a better life for her, and decides that when she gets out of jail he will take her far away from their family and their former life. However, this plan requires money, so Liam gets it the only way he knows how -- by stealing his stepfather's drugs and selling them on the street.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Ken Loach", "studio": "RoadMoviesFilmproduktion[de],TornasolFilmsS.A.,BritishBroadcastingCorporation(BBC),AltaFilmsProductions", "theater_date": "May 16, 2003", "dvd_date": "Sep 2, 2014", "box_office": "$304.7K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Loach has fashioned an achingly true portrait of a young man's despairing attempts to better his life, but coming up against social obstructions both visible and invisible.", "...a better-than-average slice-of-life kitchen-sink drama that benefits substantially from Compston's star-making performance.", "", "", "", "", "", "Under Loach's deft hand, it feels indisputably real ... An undeniable downer, but hellaciously well acted, brimming with compassion, and relevant in a way that doesn't chafe.", "Hollywood has manufactured a number of coming of age films of varying quality, yet it's difficult to think of one that tops this powerful character study", "", "You want Liam to succeed. You want a happy ending. You want to try to understand the heavy Scottish accents without reading the subtitles mercifully provided by Loach.", "Another fine Loach film that refuses to sentimentalize the plight of the poor and disenfranchised. Compston is a real find.", "The story is extremely powerful. This is a very depressing film, but also very well crafted.", "Its bleak tale was lightly delivered and filled with a wry Scottish wit and a poignant social realism that rang true.", "", "Sweet Sixteen is a wonderfully bittersweet effort, and one of Loach's best works.", "Loach tends to get a little preachy, but his skill is undeniable. His messages strike harsh and true.", "Using mostly unknown and first-time actors, Loach spins a passable coming-of-age tale, which should please his fans and provides a diversion for the rest of us.", "There are some terrific performances. Scottish TV star Compston makes Liam quite sympathetic; despite his character's many failings, you want the best for him and his family.", "The combination of its casual violence, its street sense and a loose cinematography makes the film feel like a documentary."], "rating": ["4/5", "3/4", "B+", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "2/4", "", "B+", "5/5", "", "8", "A", "B", "3.5/4", "5/5", "3.5/4", "3/5", "3.5/4", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["PJ Nabarro", "David Nusair", "Emanuel Levy", "Mark Halverson", "", "", "James Verniere", "Andrew Wright", "John A.
