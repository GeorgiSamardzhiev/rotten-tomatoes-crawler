{"metadata": {"synopsis": "One of many siblings in a large Australian family, Tony Fingleton (Jesse Spencer) struggles to make his own mark and, most importantly, garner the respect of his stern father, Harold (Geoffrey Rush). Deciding to pursue competitive swimming, Tony embarks on a quest to become the best athlete possible. Along the way, he discovers both confidence and his talent. Although Tony has the support of his beleaguered mom, Dora (Judy Davis), winning over his dad proves to be far more difficult.", "rating": "61", "genre": "Drama/Sports & Fitness", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "Russell Mulcahy", "studio": "UpstreamProductionsPty.Ltd.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 4, 2016", "box_office": "$47.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The glimpses we get of this profoundly dysfunctional and violence ridden family are just that, as if viewed vaguely from a nosy neighbor's window.", "", "...routine and banal...", "A moving drama that's ultimately worth seeing for the performances of Geoffrey Rush and Judy Davis, even if you feel that you haven't quite heard the full story.", "It'll not be remembered for the ages, but it succeeds in avoiding biopic pitfalls that have succumbed some of the best, and that's good enough to make it worth a look.", "Geoffery Rush steals the show like he always does.", "Leave it to Mulcahy to screw everything up with an overwrought, MTV-ready visual style that obscures any dramatic heft.", "...sticks closely to a formula that no longer holds many surprises, and leads to a message that isn't particularly novel or satisfying.", "In addition to the pure drama of this story, it's the performances that make the film so compelling.", "Basically, this is a fairly run-of-the-mill story of family dysfunction with a sports twist.", "The story isn't unusual or compelling enough to make a lasting impression.", "Powerhouse Australian drama...a two-hour dip into the deep end of family life.", "The audience develops a growing disconnect between the two stories of Tony the swimmer and Tony the son, lessening the impact of the overall film.", "Ultimately gets too caught up in its own current.", "Good as Rush and Davis are as combative working-class parents Harold and Dora, their story line overpowers the drippy dramatics of their teen athlete son.
