{"metadata": {"synopsis": "One winter night, a woman named Pilar (Laia Marull) can no longer tolerate her abusive husband, Antonio (Luis Tosar), and she leaves home, taking only a few possessions and her son, Juan (Nicol\u00e1s Fern\u00e1ndez Luna). Seeking solace, Pilar moves into her sister's apartment. However, Juan longs to return to life with his father.

Take My Eyes is highly recommended.", "A mesmerizing and deeply disturbing film from Spain.", "Approaching potentially unpleasant subject matter with humor, intelligence and deep compassion for its flawed yet infinitely human characters, Take My Eyes is almost certain to rank as one of the year's best films.", "Actors Laia Marull and Luis Tosar explore the intricate details of a relationship based on the laws of attraction and repulsion, in which the intellect is repeatedly devastated by primal passion.", "An extraordinarily truthful and piercing drama about spousal abuse.", "What makes the movie fascinating is that it doesn't settle for a soap opera resolution to this story, with Pilar as the victim, Antonio as the villain, and evil vanquished. It digs deeper and more painfully.", "Though deceptively straightforward in its exploration of the causes and effects of domestic abuse, Take My Eyes benefits from the grubby verisimilitude Bollan brings to his material, which otherwise might have lapsed into movie-of-the-week superficiality", "This tale of domestic abuse breaks little new stylistic or psychological ground, but it is a searing, well-acted drama that should strike universal chords.", "The performances from Marull and Tosar ... are superbly nuanced, carefully tweaking your emotions until they ensure that Take My Eyes is one of the most moving films you'll see this year.", "This small, somber drama says things to battered women they probably already know. What it says to their abusers -- of any country or culture -- they can't afford to ignore.", "We emerge worn but wiser, having stepped, if only momentarily, and secondarily, into the shoes of the brutalized.", "Harrowing, psychologically astute drama about domestic abuse.", "The story isn't exactly new, but Bollain, an actress in her own right, keeps Take My Eyes from sinking into clichs.", "These kinds of films are hard to keep out of your mind.", "The film won a sack of Goya Awards in 2004.", "Handles the subject of domestic violence with intelligence and compassion.", "The performers are luminous.", "If Take My Eyes explored how a woman could still feel for a man who abused her, it might have gripped us with its difficult truths.", "For once, it makes sense that the battered wife always returns to the abusive spouse, even if we don't believe his promises ('I've changed') any more than hers ('I'm never going back')."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "", "3/4", "3.5/4", "A", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "B", "", "4/5", "2.5/4", "3/5", "3.5/4", "3/4", "3.5/5", "2.5/5", "", "3.5/4", "C", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Amber Wilkinson", "Eric Monder", "", "Jeff Shannon", "Bill White", "Michael Wilmington", "Roger Ebert", "Nathan Rabin", "Frank Scheck", "", "Ty Burr", "Saul Austerlitz", "Ken Fox", "V.A.
