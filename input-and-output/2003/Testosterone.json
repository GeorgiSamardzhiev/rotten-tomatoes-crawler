{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Dean (David Sutcliffe) is a comic book artist living in California. When a fire destroys his home, and his lover, Pablo (Antonio Sabato Jr.), disappears, Dean suffers a creative block. With nothing else to do, he decides to go to Argentina and look for Pablo. Though Pablo's wealthy mother (Sonia Braga) offers little help, Pablo's friends Marcos (Leonardo Brzezicki) and Sofia (Celina Font) are oddly forthcoming. Meanwhile, Dean's editor (Jennifer Coolidge) demands he get to work on a new book.", "rating": "6", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "David Moreton", "studio": "BlueStreakFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 15, 2005", "box_office": "$772.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Moreton shows plenty of ambition in his second feature, but somewhere in the space between page and screen, he lost the thread.", "incredibly plot-heavy yet feels light as a feather", "Filled with pretty faces and empty logic, David Moreton's noir-wannabe Testosterone flounders about, doing everything but flutter its eyelashes in an attempt to distract us from its lack of substance.", "The movie's primary interest seems to be in following several good-looking men wherever they care to meander.", "A pointless, wandering tale of obsession that seems to have little purpose beyond showing that gay characters can be in a messed-up movie too.", "[Relies] on a creaky plot and gaping lapses in plausibility.", "Unfortunately, Testosterone isn't as provocative as its premise or its title.", "", "A tonal car wreck -- the equivalent of Chuck Norris crashing though the pages of an Isabel Allende novel.", "The tone-challenged movie is meant to be a dark comedy, but there are long stretches without laughs.", "Broken hearts and testosterone don't mix well with machetes (I think I would have preferred watching the 10 months of romance that they skipped over in the beginning).", "A lackluster and meandering exercise in psycho-sexual provocation.", "The film's major objective appears to be showing cute men doing suggestive things.
