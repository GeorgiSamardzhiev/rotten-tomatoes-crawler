But Gallo films locations with a stranger's lucidity and an impressive commitment to natural sound and undoctored images.", "Singular focus on failure, and a male rage so constrained, so constipated, you can't help but admire its concentration... Its powerful study of pathology is hardly cathartic. There's cumulative languor... sure to aggravate whatever following it finds.", "You certainly don't want to spend 90 minutes watching Vincent Gallo drive, shower, brood, and weep, which is almost all this movie is.", "When every other scene looks like a cola, jeans or motorcycle commercial -- perfectly unposed with hair proudly mussed -- Gallo's motivations seem too compromised.", "As a truncated work, it stands as a road movie tone poem.", "", "", "A humorless self-indulgent and self-loathing mess that is saddled with an uninteresting story and arty pretensions.", "Personally, I think there's a haunting and fairly poignant story here; too bad it's surrounded by so many damn driving scenes.", "", "Vincent Gallo is probably a much more interesting fellow than Bud Clay, the inarticulate motorcycle racer he portrays in The Brown Bunny.", "Is it good? Not really. But as was the case with his Buffalo 66, Gallo once again shows himself to be a fascinating enigma and possibly his own worst enemy.", "If this is a 'feature film,' then so are your old home movies, or videotapes from a convenience store's security camera. ... It's not just one scene; the whole movie blows.", "For all its anti-action, The Brown Bunny gets its teeth in you and shakes.", "", "a pretentious, silly bore of a would-be existential art film", "", "A passable, if often dreary, evocation of those '70s road movies in which disillusioned young men (and the occasional woman) took to the highway in search of America, the meaning of things or maybe just a hamburger."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "", "8/10", "", "2/5", "C-", "4/5", "5/5", "C", "3/5", "5/5", "D", "2/4", "F", "3.5/5", "2.5/4", "1.5/4", "2.5/4", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Keith Uhlich", "Richard Propes", "Dan Sallitt", "Ray Pride", "Sean Nelson", "Robert Davis", "Jason Gorber", "", "", "Dennis Schwartz", "Scott Weinberg", "", "Philip Martin", "Robert W.
