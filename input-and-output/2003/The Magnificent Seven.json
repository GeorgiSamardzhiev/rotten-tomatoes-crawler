The actors and the action make it an exciting journey, no matter the plot's small faults.", "It doesn't bring anything new to the formula, but it doesn't try to, and that's fine.", "What the movie lacks in edge, it mostly makes up for in energy and chemistry among the band of mercenaries, and that's just enough to give it a modest recommendation.", "Over all, The Magnificent Seven is everything it was required to be. I'd say it's exactly as good as the prior incarnation, and takes enough liberties with the details to merit its own existence.", "The Magnificent Seven is exactly that. If you're looking for a fun time out at the movies, you'll get that. I'm just not sure you'll remember much afterward.", "Ultimately, it's the reinvigorated Denzel Washington that makes this worthwhile, if not essential, viewing.", "On the downside, it's an uneven film. Most of the secondary characters lack depth.", "The Magnificent Seven is an entertaining film with a mix of action, drama, and comedy.", "Through successive rounds of whitewashing, one of the great works of cinema has been transformed into a bland, brainless multiplex shoot-em-up.", "Diverting action set-pieces with a mostly great cast with not nearly enough to do collectively delivers a fairly watchable rainy day outing.", "The Magnificent Seven barely lives up to the 1960 film, let alone The Seven Samurai before it. But it remains an innocuous way to kill two hours, relishing in the charm of its performers and the adoration of western tropes and trappings.", "By jettisoning the nihilism that permeated its predecessors, Mag 7 basically reduced itself to a rote modern Western. That's fine for the most part, so long as no one pairs this by-the-books crowd pleaser with either of its ancestors.", "This new take won't be for everyone but I found there was entertainment to be had.", "It's an orgy of beautifully choreographed death and destruction -- but not without humour.", "The reality is that while some of the subtlety of the original is lost, the bombastic nature of the story and of the characters goes a long way toward creating an engaging and extremely watchable cinematic energy.", "As an action movie, it hits all the quotas. It features booms, bullets and breasts. Just don't expect much more than that.", "The Magnificent Seven sticks to the cliches of the genre and doesn't disappoint.
