{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A Russian Jewish girl (Christina Ricci) is separated from her father in 1927 and escapes to England, where she's rechristened Suzie. She grows up to be a singer in a Parisian theater populated by a glamorous Russian dancer (Cate Blanchett), an egotistical Italian tenor (John Turturro) and a handsome Gypsy horseman (Johnny Depp). When the Nazis invade France, however, Suzie's life is suddenly in danger, and she attempts to flee to the United States, where her father moved years earlier.", "rating": "35", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts/Romance", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "Sally Potter", "studio": "LeStudioCanal+,WorkingTitleFilms,AdventurePictures", "theater_date": "May 25, 2001", "dvd_date": "Sep 2, 2003", "box_office": "$739.6K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "The film brings grace and balance to the traditional Holocaust story.", "", "", "The Man Who Cried hits all the wrong notes right from the get-go and never relents.", "", "", "Potter, unlike most, doesn't batter you with what she wants you to feel.
