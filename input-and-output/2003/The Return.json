{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Andrey (Vladimir Garin) and Ivan (Ivan Dobronravov) are brothers who have been raised alone by their mother. When their father (Konstantin Lavronenko) suddenly returns home after vanishing some 12 years earlier, they are both extremely happy to see him back in their lives. Ivan, however, quickly grows suspicious of his father, and determines to find out where exactly his father vanished to all those years ago, and why he suddenly decided to come back into their lives now.", "rating": "96", "genre": "Drama/Television", "runtime": "1h 50m", "director": "Andrey Zvyagintsev", "studio": "RenFilm,UnitedKingFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 8, 2017", "box_office": "$502.0K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Konstantin Lavronenko provides the film with a menacing, glowering backbone, the return of the mythical fatherland who seems interested only in typically masculine, overtly cruel rites of passage as the way to approach his progeny.", "The kind of movie you watch between your fingers as you hold your hands up to your face for protection.", "Deftly explores the dynamic between father and son and its roots in masculine rage.", "The story, set in contemporary Russia, seems unexceptional at the start. Yet it plays out against a vast wilderness of shorelines and lakes, and turns tantalizing ambiguity into urgent mystery.", "The long and eventful fishing trip Dad drags the boys on is simultaneously a very real voyage through the Russian wilderness and also, like, a Jungian trip, man.", "Throughout his expertly controlled film, Zvyagintsev never allows a break in the clouds to provide some reassuring sign that the brothers are on solid footing.", "Mysterious, compelling, visually inventive, The Return is a quiet but intense metaphysical-drama of great emotional impact and insight.", "Beautifully structured and emotionally wrenching.", "Zvyagintsev gets formidable concentration from his youthful actors, and his storytelling moves with the simplicity -- calm, chiselled, and suggestive -- of a fable.", "Constructed like an eerie, metaphorical thriller, this tense, riveting character study offers viewers nearly two hours of emotions with a stunning pay-off no one will be expecting.", "Like each episode of Kieslowski's Decalogue, The Return is a small but potent story. It leads us to ask: Is it ever enough to just 'trust and obey'?", "A harrowing, elusively biblical account&#8230; echoes of Abraham and Isaac, the Gospel parables about fathers and pairs of sons, and the Second Coming.", "Zvyagintsev's Venice prize-winner is a model of suspenseful storytelling. The acting, too, is terrific. Very highly recommended indeed.", "magnificent return of a great cinema tradition to the world stage", "Si uno se queda s\u00f3lo en la primera lectura del drama familiar, la experiencia puede ser bastante desconcertante.", "Um estudo de personagens cuja for\u00e7a se torna ainda maior em fun\u00e7\u00e3o das belas performances do trio principal.", "The Return feels like an experiment designed to find out how much basic plot information you can withhold from an audience and still have an interesting movie.", "... an unsentimental film about how childhood lingers until it abruptly ends.", "an absorbing psychological drama and coming-of-age story in the guise of a road movie", "What begins as a simple road trip becomes a spiritual journey, the classic passage from boy to man."], "rating": ["4/5", "9/10", "3.5/4", "", "", "B-", "", "", "", "", "A", "A-", "", "7/10", "4/5", "4/5", "", "9", "4.5/5", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "Nathanael Hood", "Matthew Lucas", "Joe Morgenstern", "Andrew O&#39;Hehir", "Scott Tobias", "Jon Fortgang", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Anthony Lane", "Deborah Young", "Jeffrey Overstreet", "Steven D.
