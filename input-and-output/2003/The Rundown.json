{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Beck (The Rock) is a tight-lipped bounty hunter who doesn't like to use a gun and accepts any job without asking questions. When Beck's employer, Walker (William Lucking), sends him to the Amazon to locate Walker's cocky son, Travis (Seann William Scott), Beck discovers a population controlled by a tyrannical treasure hunter (Christopher Walken). To survive, Beck and Travis must work together, without their affections for a mysterious rebel (Rosario Dawson) getting in the way.", "rating": "69", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Peter Berg", "studio": "WWEFilms,MisherFilms,UniversalPictures,StrikeEntertainment,ColumbiaPicturesCorporation,IM3Entertainment", "theater_date": "Sep 26, 2003", "dvd_date": "Aug 24, 2015", "box_office": "$47.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The Rock and Scott play an unconventional buddy team that has a similar dynamic to Robert De Niro and Charles Grodin in Midnight Run, but without the acting ability or comic touch.", "The Rock and Seann William Scott work up some nice comic chemistry, but it's the dependably warped Walken who steals the most scenes.
