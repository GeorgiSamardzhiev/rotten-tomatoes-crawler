{"metadata": {"synopsis": "David Hurst (Campbell Scott) is a mild-mannered dentist who shares a practice with his wife, Dana (Hope Davis). Concerned about Dana's recent sullen moods, David begins to suspect that she is cheating on him. As David becomes deeply unsettled by the possibility of Dana's infidelity, he begins having extended conversations with Slater (Denis Leary), a surly patient who dispenses plenty of blunt advice. Can Dana and David reconcile and save their marriage, or are they destined to separate?", "rating": "85", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Alan Rudolph", "studio": "HolediggerFilmsInc.,ReadyMadeFilm", "theater_date": "Aug 1, 2003", "dvd_date": "Dec 2, 2014", "box_office": "$3.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A profound study of lack of communication in a marriage with some great performances from Scott, Davis, and Leary.", "", "", "", "", "Retrata com sensibilidade o cotidiano de uma fam\u00edlia em crise e representa mais uma prova dos talentos de Scott e Davis.", "One of those quietly brilliant indies, so small in scope that it takes a little extra attention to appreciate how deeply it plunges into its characters.", "The Secret Lives of Dentists is a provocative title, promising much more than this domestic melodrama is able to deliver.", "...[T]he potency is abrogated by Rudolph's indulgent pretension of including Scott's personified conscience in the form of an obstreperous patient...", "Rudolph's fondness for angular, oblique characterization is ideally suited to the movie's incidental story of sublimated feelings and contradictory impulses.", "Domestic scenes with the kids are drawn with letter-perfect naturalism.", "Funny but not a comedy, slow but not plodding, narrow in scope but not uninteresting.", "For me (unlike some critics who have embraced this film), Leary becomes so persistent, so grating and so bloody irritating that I want to scream: Stop the madness!
