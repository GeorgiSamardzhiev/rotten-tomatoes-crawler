On the contrary, Bergman has publicly scorned the \"religiosity\" school of lip-service...", "a spare, intense, introspective look at the interpersonal dynamics of a quartet of family members struggling with their own identities and their understanding of each other", "This is Ingmar Bergman's best film in years. It is classically compact.", "This winner of the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film packs a punch.", "The acting is finely modulated; Miss Andersson's flirtation with insanity is a ballet.", "Through a Glass Darkly is one of the best and certainly the ripest of Ingmar Bergman's creations, a film as subtle as Wild Strawberries but solider in substance.", "You can freeze almost any frame of this film and be looking at a striking still photograph.", "Elaborately rhetorical at the end, this 1961 film nevertheless develops its theme lucidly and with some of Bergman's most unforgettable sequences.", "It is almost superfluous to note that the film is beautifully made: visually exquisite, ingeniously knit.", "Bergman's mastery with actors (there is absolutely never a bad performance in a single one of his films) and with the cinematic form (using space and mood to communicate his theme) is abundantly clear here.", "", "A film in search of profound truths that it can only hint at having caught glimmerings of, and it's a truly remarkable experience.", "Bergman's wintry film has beautiful moments and Andersson gives a great performance, but the film can't shake the weight of the disease-of-the-week movie feel.", "The first of Ingmar Bergman's bleak but outstanding films from his trilogy of chamber plays about faith, alienation and the emptiness of life.", "Not a pleasant film, it is a great one.", "", "[Features] The usual fine performances from Bergman's regulars combined with a script that is not as ponderous as much of the director's other works."], "rating": ["", "4.5/5", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "4/4", "", "", "4/4", "5/5", "5/5", "3/4", "A", "", "4/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Janet Graves", "Tim Brayton", "Peter Harcourt", "Clyde Gilmour", "James Kendrick", "Dwight MacDonald", "Matt Brunson", "Walter Goodman", "", "Roger Ebert", "Don Druker", "Stanley Kauffmann", "Jay Antani", "Cole Smithey", "Ken Hanke", "Jeffrey M.
