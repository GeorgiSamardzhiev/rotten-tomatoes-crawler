With only a handful of clues to the baby's identity, the three misfits search the streets of Tokyo for help in returning the baby to its parents.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Animation/Art House & International/Comedy/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Satoshi Kon", "studio": "MadHouseCompanyLtd.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 2, 2017", "box_office": "$129.0K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A modern anim\u00e9 classic fit for rediscovery by both adults and kids-not to mention a stirring celebration of inclusivity that remains ahead of its time.", "Tokyo Godfathers stands as an excellent anime film and a really fun Christmas movie.", "Tokyo Godfathers is a beautiful, hilarious movie and one that cemented Satoshi Kon as a visionary and narrative master.", "Less fanciful in plot and style than Kon's other movies, yet it compensates with its deep humanism.", "Unique anime has mature themes, drinking, cursing.", "There are a lot of reasons why this film works, but I think at the heart is an emotional resonance we connect with", "It's not a perfect film, but it excites, makes you laugh and reconciles one with the human race and that's a rare thing. [Full Review in Spanish]", "A film which shows the limitless potential of animation, Tokyo Godfathers is an alternative Christmas classic that's full of unexpected twists, turns and miracles. A festive bonanza which will put plenty of smiles on many faces.", "With peerless animation, plenty of laughs and just as much heart, Tokyo Godfathers is an absolute joy. It should appear high on your list of alternative Christmas movies.", "Hana tends to swoon into stereotype, her theatricality and campiness infecting the other non-hetero characters here, with so many of them wailing or sobbing. The story's comedy and pathos can be similarly overwrought, too.", "In one sense the plot involves returning stolen goods to a thief, but Tokyo Godfathers is really about longing -- for family, for children, for parents and for the lost past.", "A likeably larky Yuletide yarn.", "Tokyo Godfathers becomes a clever and well-written parody of Christ's nativity.", "No amount of shoehorned-in razzle-dazzle can keep this forced fable from feeling like a shadow of Kon's early work.", "Japanese animator Satoshi Kon has a striking sense of composition, but I'm more impressed by his storytelling skills.", "Takes anime to a whole new level.", "The score grates in places but the script hits the mark, with the potty-mouthed vagrants certain to be a hit with older children.", "Depois do brilhante Millenium Actress, Kon conta uma hist\u00f3ria bem mais simples, mas igualmente tocante e m\u00e1gica, brindando o p\u00fablico com uma bel\u00edssima anima\u00e7\u00e3o de tirar o f\u00f4lego.", "It's a modern-day fable with a big heart...", "A delightfully rambunctious holiday fable about the vital importance of family."], "rating": ["", "A", "", "3/4", "3/5", "9/10", "", "7/10", "9/10", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "5/5", "3.5/5", "B+"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nick Schager", "Chris Stuckmann", "Kyle Anderson", "Matt Brunson", "Brian Costello", "Rachel Wagner", "Juan Luis Caviaro", "Jonathan Edwards", "Courtney Button", "Brian Gibson", "Joe Morgenstern", "", "James Keith La Croix", "Tasha Robinson", "J.
