{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The Top Gun Naval Fighter Weapons School is where the best of the best train to refine their elite flying skills. When hotshot fighter pilot Maverick (Tom Cruise) is sent to the school, his reckless attitude and cocky demeanor put him at odds with the other pilots, especially the cool and collected Iceman (Val Kilmer). But Maverick isn't only competing to be the top fighter pilot, he's also fighting for the attention of his beautiful flight instructor, Charlotte Blackwood (Kelly McGillis).", "rating": "54", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Tony Scott", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$179.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Slickly made, it's a fairly entertaining watch that doesn't provide much beyond surface thrills, although many have had fun analyzing its (unintentional?) homoerotic content.", "Tony Scott brought some incredible shots to the film, mounting cameras everywhere on the fighter jets to achieve amazing footage while giving the audience the feeling they were flying right alongside Maverick.", "The film's intensity mirrors the competitive and wild personalities of the pilots themselves. In this arena, the casting is on-target.", "... \"Top Gun\" is terribly monotonous.", "The movie, in short, hits its emotional marks, but it does so with such insistence that it feels less like real life than an object lesson in the architecture of the blockbuster.", "Could Top Gun actually be a portrait of the dark side of American individualism?", "\"Top Gun\" works best as a sort of time capsule, a window into a pretty spectacular decade for big-budget filmmaking.", "Cruise, the cheesy soundtrack and the stunning aerial photography that marks out its combat scenes are its three main selling points.", "You can argue that it's a cool movie, but is \"Top Gun\" a good movie? I'd definitely say \"Hell no,\" topped with \"Are you kidding me?\"", "The unashamedly goofy 1986 dogfighting classic flips on the afterburners to make yet another pass on Blu-ray, this time soaring into the third dimension.", "It's still the same old Top Gun, retaining every frame of ridiculousness and emphatic acting that turned the Don Simpson/Jerry Bruckheimer production into a legend.", "The 3D is impressive considering it wasn't shot for that, and the sound delivers full throttle engine roars and the legendary soundtrack sounds as crisp as ever.", "If you missed it in theaters the first time, it's probably going to be the best movie theater experience you'll have so far this year.", "An undeniably cheesy yet strangely appealing time capsule, with a little something for everyone provided we understand that it's all bubblegum.", "There are elements that hold up - especially Cruise's blinding charisma. The aerial scenes are still thrilling, and perfectly suited to a giant screen. Everything else? Well, that depends on how nostalgic you're feeling.", "The aerial sequences in Top Gun are as thrilling -- while remaining coherent -- as any ever put on film.", "Watching Top Gun again twenty five years after its release is still a dazzling and dizzying experience. You are not so much on the edge of your seat as flung around it as the on-screen action endlessly spins and soars.", "Basically perfect, even it is perfect at one of the worst sorts of things a movie can attempt.", "Whether you love Top Gun or hate it -- or hate yourself for loving it -- the fact is that when it became the top-grossing film of 1986, Hollywood in its infinite wisdom took all of the worst lessons from its success and overlooked what made it so... fun.", "Among the first generation of films influenced by the cutting techniques of music videos, a progression of oversaturated, meaty images, embarrassing dialogue and awful music."], "rating": ["2.5/4", "4.5/5", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "3/5", "2.5/5", "", "3.5/4", "C", "4/5", "4/5", "B", "3/5", "3/4", "7/10", "5/10", "B", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Matt Brunson", "Allison Rose", "Duane Byrge", "Kathleen Carroll", "Paul Attanasio", "Josh Larsen", "J.
