{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1985, two young climbers, Joe Simpson (Brendan Mackey) and Simon Yates (Nicholas Aaron), set out to be the first to reach the summit of the Siula Grande in the Peruvian Andes. They succeed, and the two embark on the treacherous descent down the mountain -- only to meet with disaster when Simpson breaks his leg in a fall, leaving Yates to lower him the rest of the way with ropes. When a storm threatens both their lives, Yates must decide whether to cut the rope and risk Simpson's likely death.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Documentary/Special Interest/Sports & Fitness", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Kevin Macdonald", "studio": "DarlowSmithsonProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 15, 2017", "box_office": "$4.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["In the right hands, a docudrama can deliver all the excitement, emotion and storytelling of the very best feature films -- and director Kevin Macdonald has done that with startling clarity in the mountaineering adventure Touching the Void.", "Excruciatingly tense story of a terrible accident.", "\"Void\" plummets into the nucleus of instinct and consciousness - survival a near-primordial pursuit beyond bravery or weakness. It concocts no comfort about what was gained, but stares in transfixed, unforgettable awe at the horror of all that was lost.", "\"Touching the Void\" towers above the rest of that rarest of all film genres, the docudrama.", "This harrowing, white-knuckle tale of human endurance and gut-wrenching dilemma mingles the dramatization of these events and interviews with both climbers into an unforgettable, sometimes comically deadpan nightmare.", "Touching the Void leaves you emotionally and physically spent, and grateful it was only a movie, not a mountain, you had to endure.", "Awesome and harrowing.", "A slow starter which builds into a chilling depiction of the agonising disintegration of body and mind as they are exposed to the elements.", "As a meditation on extreme human endeavour, character, friendship and the mysteries revealed by facing death, it provides much food for thought.", "About a primal war waged by man against both himself and the natural world that surrounds him.", "It's certainly a far better thriller than anything Hollywood has churned out lately.", "This is a gripping tale of courage and survival with gorgeous cinematography.", "With his new film Macdonald has achieved, if not physical elevation, then at least spiritual soaring.", "Most movies of this type re-create the action far from the actual scene of the crime, but Macdonald has invented a new subgenre: a docudrama in which the docu and the drama are equally authentic.", "The facts drop away, and it becomes impossible not to read the movie symbolically -- as a journey to the center of the earth, or farther still.", "Illustrates the inherent human instinct to self-preserve.", "Forget those Hollywood movies about extreme sports. MacDonald...has created a thrilling picture about a high-risk sport based on a true story.", "A combina\u00e7\u00e3o de depoimentos e reencena\u00e7\u00f5es extremamente realistas transformam este \"docudrama\" em um filme tenso, emocionante e inspirador.", "if you've considered heading for the high ground, the movie might steer you toward a less taxing hobby -- perhaps chainsaw-juggling or organizing piranha water ballets.", "If I said this is about the adventures of three guys on a mountain, you'd probably go to the next page.
