{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Bored with life in his tiny village, Dondup (Tsewang Dandup), a Bhutanese official infatuated with American culture, dreams of visiting the United States. On the road to Thimphu, a major city where he hopes to obtain a visa, Dondup befriends a mismatched group of travelers, including a monk (Sonam Kinga). As the trip proceeds, the monk tells his new friends about Tashi (Lhakpa Dorji), a fictional young man whose dissatisfaction leads to his undoing.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Art House & International/Documentary/Drama", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Khyentse Norbu", "studio": "PrayerFlagPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 11, 2017", "box_office": "$505.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Travelers and Magicians is deeply affecting.
