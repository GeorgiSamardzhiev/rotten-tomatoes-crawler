{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This loose modernized adaptation of the Charles Dickens tale focuses on Dodge (Nick Stahl), a street-smart Toronto hustler. When Dodge meets wide-eyed innocent runaway Oliver (Joshua Close), he teaches the youth how to survive in their harsh urban environment and also introduces him to plenty of vices. Working under Fagin (Gary Farmer), an imposing pimp, Dodge and Oliver engage in prostitution and drug abuse, with no easy way out of their trouble-filled existence.", "rating": "16", "genre": "Drama/Gay & Lesbian", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Jacob Tierney", "studio": "VictoriousFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 26, 2017", "box_office": "$46.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "My memory may be a little vague on this one, but I don't recall any incest scenes in the original Oliver Twist", "This would make Dickens suicidal, probably in more than one way.", "One of the glummest recent attempts to drag a classic story into the 21st century.", "A surprisingly deep, dramatic twist on an old melodrama.", "A joyless series of shooting-up scenes.", "Unrelenting in its tragedy, this movie should come with a major bummer warning or something to help you recover from the haunting images. The story is a little thin at times.", "The only thing funny about Twist is how seriously it takes its own pompous preposterousness.", "Isn't without interest, but overall it's more an earnest attempt than a successful accomplishmrent.", "The movie's far too stagy and pretentious.", "Cuaron ran into trouble by being overly faithful to Dickens' story, changing almost nothing except the setting.", "There's nothing here a handful of show-stopping production numbers -- or a good steam cleaning -- couldn't fix.", "Apart from the somewhat novel conceit of turning Dickens into the stuff of a Gus Van Sant picture (see My Own Private Idaho), there's nothing original, nor compelling, about Twist.", "Ultimately more unsavory than enlightening, and would have benefited from a more humorous approach to its purloined themes.", "transforming the ending into a more realistic outcome doesn't make this provocative arthouse fare", "Exceptional performances and effective raw moments, but too sordid for enjoyment.", "Not much happens in Twist, apart from a dismal series of personal degradations, each more depressing than the last.", "[Tierney] shows a sure and confident hand in the script-writing, pacing and his vision of a starkly-shot grey, cold and inhospitable Toronto in the dead of winter.", "Stahl is definitely one to watch closely -- he's the real deal.
