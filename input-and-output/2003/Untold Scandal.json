{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 18th-century Korea, the bored Madam Jo (Lee Mi-Sook) knows her husband has eyes for 16-year-old virgin So-ok (Lee So-yeon), so Jo sends her cousin, Jo-won (Bae Yong-jun), to seduce the young girl before her spouse can. But that's just the beginning of the sexual gamesmanship, as Jo-won instead wants to pursue the repressed and religious Lady Suk (Jeon Do-yeon) ; however, this lustful act might bring about more devastating consequences than the typical bedroom conquest.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 4m", "director": "Je-yong Lee", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 27, 2020", "box_office": "$63.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["If you've never seen another version and love costume drama, this is the one to see.
