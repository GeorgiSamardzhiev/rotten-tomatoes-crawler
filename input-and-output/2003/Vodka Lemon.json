{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Hamo (Romen Avinian) lives in a small village in rural Armenia after the fall of the Soviet Union. As the village struggles to find its identity in the post-Soviet world, Hamo grieves for his wife, taking the bus to the cemetery every day to visit her grave. One day he meets Nina (Lala Sarkissian), a poor bar owner, who is at the cemetery visiting the resting place of her husband. Hamo and Nina gradually build a relationship founded on commiseration.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Hiner Saleem", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$57.8K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Worthwhile for the cinematography alone, which is nothing short of inspired, such as the love scene shot through the pale pattern of a lace curtain, which dissolves almost imperceptibly into the whiteout of a steady blizzard.", "An appealing film, a window onto a part of the world passed over by history.", "This is frostbitten Fellini -- a film that finds fresh beauty and contentment in the wake of centuries of conquering armies.", "The film ends on a surreal image of such remarkable whimsy and good cheer that it will keep you warm for a while after the credits roll.", "Despite some banalities and Romen Avinian's slightly overdone Hamo, Vodka Lemon is a fresh breath of air, warmer than the icy village in which it takes place. You'll leave the theater with a wink and a smile.", "Director Hiner Saleem has created a magical movie that veers, even within scenes, from love story to tragedy to comic relief.", "If you're in need of a little inspiration, a shot of Vodka Lemon will do you nicely.", "Manages to chill our bones while delighting that part of us that relishes absurdity.", "Saleem nourishes his tale of the widower Hamo and widow Nina with a greening bud of romance. And he has wit and warmth to spare for all the movie's denizens.", "A thematically bleak yet subtly comic film.", "Vodka Lemon dispenses with the usual conventions of most holiday films at the multiplex.", "A bright and acerbic quality accentuates the film's lean, angled outlook on life.", "Vodka Lemon is an appealingly wry little film that is as appetizing as its title.", "Hiner Saleem achieves the droll absurdity of a folktale with a vein of magical realism in this exceedingly dry and precise and slow-paced comedy set in a depressed, tiny village in northern post-Soviet Armenia.", "The situation in these former republics may indeed be dire, but it's a breeding ground for exciting cinema.", "Vodka moves about as fast as the distant ice caps melt.", "There is no small amount of splendor to be found in its frozen panoramas and charm in its idiosyncratic storytelling.", "He's in no hurry to tell the story, and viewers drawn in by the warm-hearted tale and charmingly eccentric characters will be in no hurry for the closing credits.", "Diverting but minor.", "A dry, dark comedy."], "rating": ["4/4", "", "2.5/4", "3/4", "3/4", "3/4", "", "B", "2.5/4", "", "", "B+", "4/5", "", "3.5/5", "2.5/4", "", "3.5/4", "2/4", "2.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Kam Williams", "Rex Roberts", "Ty Burr", "Rob Thomas", "Marta Barber", "Jonathan Curiel", "Jean Lowerison", "Robert Denerstein", "Lisa Kennedy", "Desson Thomson", "Ann Hornaday", "Donald Munro", "Kevin Thomas", "David Chute", "Ken Fox", "Robert Dominguez", "Lisa Rose", "V.A.
