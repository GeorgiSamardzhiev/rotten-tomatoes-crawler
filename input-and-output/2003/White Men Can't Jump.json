{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Billy Hoyle (Woody Harrelson) is a white basketball hustler who banks on black players underestimating his skills on the court. When he pulls one over on Sidney Deane (Wesley Snipes), his victim sees a lucrative opportunity, and they become partners in the con game, plying their trade across the courts of Los Angeles. Meanwhile, Billy has to keep one step ahead of mobsters, to whom he owes money, while staying on the good side of his \"Jeopardy!\"-obsessed, motormouth wife (Rosie Perez).", "rating": "76", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "Ron Shelton", "studio": "TwentiethCenturyFox", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$71.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Slam-dunkingly satisfying sports comedy about two basketball hustlers (Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes) teaming up for an alley-oop of a payday, despite crying foul about each other's off-court lifestyle.", "Shelton is clever, and he obviously loves sports and beautiful women and even Los Angeles. Yet when it comes to telling a story, he can't seem to hit this time around.", "As rough and shiny as chain nets on a sweltering summer day, White Men Can't Jump is a poetic, rag-tag triumph.", "Shelton's strength is character, streetwise wit and funky, lived-in sexuality. Snipes, one of our most versatile young actors, gets to demonstrate his wonderful comic chops, and Harrelson, whose goofiness is part of his scam, partners him beautifully.", "A fresh and exuberant romantic comedy that is as smart about playground basketball as Bull Durham was about minor league baseball.", "They're black and white instead of fat and thin, but Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson have the makings of a classic comedy team, the Laurel and Hardy of the half-court game.", "Harrelson's performance is rich, subtle, and delicately funny. And Snipes is just amazing: everything he does seems to leap off the screen.", "White Man Can't Jump is most effective at the beginning -- when it's bouncing along with the exuberance that Shelton brought to such other sports-minded movies as Bull Durham and The Best of Times.", "Despite charismatic performances by Woody Harrelson and Wesley Snipes as nothing-but- net shooters who might be called the Schmo and the Bro, White Men Can't Jump throws up mostly bricks.", "It's a funny, frequently rousing film, with a warmly appealing acting partnership at its center-between basketball hustlers Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson.", "[Shelton] contributes a uniquely eccentric point of view that is simultaneously obsessed with and ambivalent about sports, athletes and competition.", "Wesley Snipes and Woody Harrelson give lively performances as the heroes, who relate better to basketballs than to women or the business world. The movie doesn't add up to very much, though.", "Ron Shelton's film about two basketball hustlers hasn't aged well.", "[White Men Can't Jump is] like a game of pick-up basketball: it's intense, raggedy and explosive, now and then yielding moments of sheer gravity-defying grace, yet just as capable of producing air balls and pratfalls.", "Writer/director Ron Shelton is that rare beast: someone who can make movies with wit, warmth and perception about American sports.", "The verbal interplay between the characters appears to be intentionally improvised, but the scenes come off as cumbersome and off-kilter.", "The real pleasures of White Men are its energetic performances and dialogue.", "White Men features some amusingly daft racial banter.", "Hustlin' hoops tale with too much skin for kids.", "Even basketball-phobes will enjoy it."], "rating": ["3/5", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "3/5", "2.5/4", "3/4", "3/4", "", "", "2.5/4", "4/5", "2/4", "", "B-", "2/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Leigh Paatsch", "Malcolm Johnson", "Duane Byrge", "David Ansen", "Gene Siskel", "Kenneth Turan", "Terrence Rafferty", "Jay Boyar", "Carrie Rickey", "Dave Kehr", "Bill Kelley", "David Sterritt", "Matt Chapman", "Stephen Hunter", "John Ferguson", "Gary Thompson", "", "Owen Gleiberman", "Heather Boerner", ""], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4"], "date": ["July 31, 2020", "May 30, 2018", "March 27, 2018", "February 9, 2018", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "April 2, 2014", "September 7, 2011", "December 18, 2010", "July 31, 2008"]}}
