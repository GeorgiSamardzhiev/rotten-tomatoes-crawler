{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Desperate for companionship, the repressed Willard (Crispin Glover) befriends a group of rats that inhabit his late father's deteriorating mansion. In these furry creatures, Willard finds temporary refuge from daily abuse at the hands of his bedridden mother (Jackie Burroughs) and his father's old partner, Frank (R. Lee Ermey). Soon it becomes clear that the brood of rodents is ready and willing to exact a vicious, deadly revenge on anyone who dares to bully their sensitive new master.", "rating": "64", "genre": "Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Glen Morgan", "studio": "NewLineCinema", "theater_date": "Mar 14, 2003", "dvd_date": "Dec 1, 2012", "box_office": "$6.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Glover is almost gleeful in the film.", "For all its ickiness, Willard is actually that most exotic of movie creatures: a remake that handily bests the original.", "Morgan's camera work is more sure-footed than his screenplay.", "Crispin Glover should be nominated for an Oscar", "The vengeance-driven plot creeps along at a snail's pace, and all the teeth-gnashing and cheek-quivering in the world-courtesy of Glover's demented Willard Stiles-cannot save the day.", "Terrifying and violent horror movie. Rats -- EWW.", "No one can do the funny/scary/crazy/creepy high-decibel wig-out/breakdown scene nearly as well as Glover can.", "Never scares, never pulls off enough tension, and the rats are bland.", "", "The rats multiply at a rate that suggests Willard's basement is the city's red light district.", "This Willard remix is a gothic, creaking, brilliantly macabre and unexpectedly intimate movie.", "", "", "", "If you want a lesson in eccentric acting, or if you are interested in a nightmarish story well told, Willard is a noteworthy effort.", "The filmmakers may have been too intelligent for their camp material. They spend too much time on background material, an over-developed hero, atmosphere, and in-jokes.", "No funciona como filme de terror (sua inteno original), mas torna-se interessante graas  curiosa atuao de Glover e  fotografia sombria.

This new version seems to exist in a bubble.
