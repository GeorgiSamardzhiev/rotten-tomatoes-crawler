It is also, like most of its kind, a pleasant means of passing an hour and a half in air-conditioned comfort.", "I enjoyed every minute.", "A good western.", "Yes -- it's another frontier saga type, but the acting of James Stewart, Shelly Winters, Dan Duryea, and Stephen McNally lift it from the rut.", "With such a strong cast, the film almost turns into an ensemble film instead of a star vehicle for Stewart in his first of many collaborations with Mann.", "Strikingly photographed in black & white, the film is directed with an eye to realistic detail, an ear for the script's frequently natural dialogue and a knack for building suspense.", "This is a fine, mature work: adult, intelligent and moral, creating a laconic new persona for the admirable Stewart.", "Winchester '73 changed the way cinema audiences saw the Western, because it featured a more complex idea of the noble hero of the west -- a man plagued by personal problems and violent impulses.", "Atmospheric Western with an unusual look at Dodge City and Wyatt Earp.", "Winchester '73 is simply one of the finest Westerns ever made, in a class with the best of Ford and Hawks.", "The ruthless scraping of the Western's heroic veneer is Anthony Mann's stroke of genius", "Every bit the classic its reputation suggests.", "The first collaboration between director Mann and actor Stewart, a team that would create a series of superior westerns that added a new, psychological dimension to the genre.", "Stewart brings real flavor and appeal to the role of Lin, in a lean, concentrated portrayal.", "Mann's first film with James Stewart, with whom he was to make a series of classic Westerns, this offers the clearest example of Mann's use of the revenge plot.", "At one time, the phrase 'action director' didn't mean a technician who knew how to stage the biggest explosions. It meant someone who understood the psychology of action, the reasons behind it.", "A frisky, fast-moving, funny Western in which a rifle is the apple of a cowboy's eye.", "One of the truly great Westerns, directed and acted with flawless skill in the old style."], "rating": ["7/10", "", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "4/5", "5/5", "", "", "", "5/5", "4/5", "", "", "4/4", "", "A"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Harry MacArthur", "Nelson Burns (Te Pana)", "Virginia Graham", "Clyde Gilmour", "Robin Slessor", "William Thomas", "TIME Staff", "Tony Sloman", "Martin Chilton", "Michael E.
