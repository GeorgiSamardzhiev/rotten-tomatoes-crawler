{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Stryker (Brian Cox), a villianous former Army commander, holds the key to Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) past and the future of the X-Men. This threat re-ignites the call for a mutant registration act. Stryker starts a full-out assault on Professor Xavier's (Patrick Stewart) mansion and school. After escaping his plastic cell, Magneto (Ian McKellen) proposes a partnership with Xavier and the X-Men to combat this new formidable enemy they both have in common.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 14m", "director": "Bryan Singer", "studio": "MarvelFilms", "theater_date": "May 2, 2003", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$214.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Once again, there's plenty of action, though the overdependence on wirework and computer-augmented fight choreography grows ever more grating.", "Superior to the 2000 original in every way and a classic within the comics/superhero film genre. [Full review in Spanish]", "X2: X-Men United is better than its predecessor in every way.", "Spends way too much time reverently aggrandising its mutant/outsider theme, when in reality we're talking about people with non-pitiable superhuman skills.", "Like the first movie, it wraps everything up in spectacular action scenes powered by special effects that are all the more impressive because director Bryan Singer does not let them overwhelm the other elements of the movie.", "A movie that seemed great in the theater in 2003 that has not held up thanks to social progress and the franchise's complete disregard for continuity.", "The truth is, the film is never again as good as its brilliant opening sequence.", "X-Men works because it isn't about the effects. It's really about being different (in this case, a mutant). That's why it resonates so with its adolescent fans.", "X-Men 2 remains a decent enough sci-fi effort, which delivers on most of the levels fans could expect. Too bad it's hampered by a plot that wouldn't get green-lit for an average episode of Buffy.", "Director Bryan Singer skilfully keeps multiple subplots spinning while moving inexorably towards a climax that puts the first film's Liberty Island sequence in the shade.", "X2's excessively complicated and character-crammed plot, which only a teen boy could care about enough to follow closely, has a nasty human bigwig (Brian Cox) fomenting a war against the mutants.", "X2 is an interesting fantasy, always aware of its need to remain that way. Considering today's Hollywood, that may be its most amazing power of all.", "X2 still feels like a prologue. No matter how much goes on, you feel like nothing has happened.", "The light tone and modest character development of X-Men have given way to an avalanche of digital effects and a bloated symphonic score.", "This satisfying new installment looks like just the thing to get the summer blockbuster season off to a supercharged start.", "X2 is the movie the first one should've been.", "Bryan Singer lifts the X-Men franchise out of the formulaic superhero realm in his rip-roaring sequel.", "Fortunately, bigger usually equals better here, and when it doesn't, it equals just as good.", "Performances are solid throughout, with the actors managing to straight-face their way through some truly inane dialogue.", "In Singer's hands, you never feel there's anything at stake."], "rating": ["5/10", "4/5", "5/5", "1/5", "3/4", "", "", "B+", "", "4/5", "", "A-", "", "", "3/4", "4/5", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Fico Cangiano", "Danielle Solzman", "PJ Nabarro", "Ron Weiskind", "Leona Laurie", "Alexander Walker", "Joel Siegel", "Barbara Ellen", "Andrew Collins", "Leah Rozen", "Steve Persall", "Sam Adams", "J.
