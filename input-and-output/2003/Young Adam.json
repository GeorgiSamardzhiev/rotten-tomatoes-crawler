It's a movie full of explicit sex scenes and almost no passion, and it's a beautiful-looking film with a very ugly soul at its center.", "An amoral and boring affair, beautifully filmed but empty at its core.", "The movie ladles out its atmosphere of quiet dread admirably, but atmosphere alone seldom makes a film watchable.
