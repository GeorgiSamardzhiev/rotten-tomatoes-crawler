{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A comedy-drama starring Hugh Grant as Will, a rich, child-free and irresponsible Londoner in his thirties who, in search of available women, invents an imaginary son and starts attending single parent meetings.

Gradually, Will and Marcus become friends, and as Will teaches Marcus how to be a cool kid, Marcus helps Will to finally grow up.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Chris Weitz, Paul Weitz", "studio": "TribecaProductions", "theater_date": "May 17, 2002", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$40.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The splendid effectiveness of 'About a Boy' lies fully in the precise work of adaptation that the Weitz brothers make of the original text. [Full Review in Spanish]", "In print. Hornby's story was lapped up by women. On screen, it looks likes the worst kind of unconvincing, unfelt schmaltz, and faintly misogynist in the subordination of its female characters to the needs of its male star. Come back, Richard Curtis.", "While the movie has some awkwardly executed scenes and slow spots... this is a comedy with a heart... It's funny, it's smart, it's poignant - and it's set on Planet Earth.", "...a thoroughly average piece of work...", "Even people who don't usually like Hugh Grant will be charmed by him in the scrappy, slightly scandalous comedy About a Boy.", "The directors Paul and Chris Weitz -- the American Pie brothers -- have tried hard not to make a tearjerker, and at its best the movie is knowing and tart.", "If the story gets dangerously thin, Grant is pretty well flawless. And Collette, always good, is heartbreakingly believable.", "About a Boy is truly a love story, with dialogue and a story line that's both pop and universally timeless, which is gold for moviegoers.", "This is a pleasingly skewed Britcom that can be watched with mates or the other half. And, boy, is it funny.", "Genuinely funny and moving, this is both an endearing examination of masculinity and a challenge to male isolationism.", "Grant's puckishness has become overly packaged; what's new about him here is his spiky hairdo. This movie is built on an actor as well as a character who is too intent to be on his best behavior.", "Mainstream comedies should all be this funny and tender and deftly performed.", "Grant, seeming to get better the further he's allowed to extend his range, delivers a terrific central performance, as acerbic but more complex than his sexy snake in Bridget Jones.", "Hugh Grant hilariously redefines the word \"playboy\" in the first half of this film, then gets human, without losing his comic edge, under the influence of the title waif.", "About a Boy is better than a feelgood movie, it's a feelgreat movie -- genuinely clever, affecting when you least expect it to be and funny from start to finish.", "Compared to High Fidelity, the book and the movie, About A Boy seems resolutely uncool.... But part of growing up may be admitting that such familiar comforts can also be immensely satisfying.", "About a Boy is an amusing film, full of bright lines and clever observation.", "This charming coming of age comedy, a tale with heart and social message, offers Hugh Grant his best role to date.", "Thankfully, this film is grounded and has a firm sense of reality and is consequently more affecting for it.", "Like Billy Wilder with a British bent, \"About a Boy\" lithely dances around uneasy comedy - attempted suicide, fragile kids of divorce, childhood bereft of memorable experiences. But it never trivializes them, emphasizing life's quality over its quantity."], "rating": ["", "", "", "2.5/4", "3/4", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "2.5/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "B+", "4/5", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Mark Steyn", "Jean Westmoore", "David Nusair", "Jami Bernard", "David Denby", "Tom Gliatto", "Anita Schmaltz", "", "Lorien Haynes", "Michael Sragow", "David Edelstein", "Sheila Johnston", "Richard Schickel", "Joe Morgenstern", "Scott Tobias", "Philip French", "Emanuel Levy", "Daniel Saney", "Nick Rogers"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Buffalo News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro Times (Detroit, MI)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slate", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Observer (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Digital Spy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Yap"], "date": ["September 4, 2019", "January 29, 2018", "May 24, 2017", "March 17, 2015", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "March 18, 2013", "July 14, 2011", "September 25, 2010"]}}
