{"metadata": {"synopsis": "British-born ladies' man Alfie (Jude Law) exploits his job as a New York City limousine driver to meet and sleep with attractive women -- which infuriates his pseudo-girlfriend Julie (Marisa Tomei), a single mom. His libertine lifestyle is interrupted, however, when his girl-crazy ways end up hurting his best friend, Marlon (Omar Epps). Desperate, Alfie attempts a go at monogamy with the ravishing Nikki (Sienna Miller), but even her good looks aren't enough to keep him out of trouble for long.", "rating": "48", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Charles Shyer", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "Nov 5, 2004", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$13.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Unpredictably fun, endlessly entertaining, intelligent and full of heart, [Alfie] is the surprise of the season; and one where you won't find yourself asking \"What's it all about\" when the curtain falls.", "The weakness is the script (by Elaine Pope, who won an Emmy for Seinfeld and should've done better). It isn't funny, it isn't clever and it certainly isn't profound.", "Uneven movie about a charming cad has sexy stuff.", "Just as forgettable as the original.", "Even Michael Caine's career would have gone nowhere if he had made this version of \"Alfie.\"", "", "Law, though lacking the more rugged masculinity and raw sensuality of Caine's alluring Alfie, gets by here on sheer sexual enthusiasm and that unmistakable ready-for-duty party animal mentality.", "full review in Greek", "...Alfie - when you get right down to it - isn't a terribly likable character, something that certainly makes it difficult to actually care about his fate.", "", "", "So, what's it all about?
