There isn't an obvious problem with this, except that it makes no sense whatsoever.", "Occasionally, the dialogue exudes intelligence, but it's delivered with a perpetual drabness and spiritlessness by a cast that seems genuinely bored in their involvement.", "All the King's Men makes me fear not for the Republic, but for the future of political movies. I can imagine a similarly misguided stab at bringing Harvey Milk to the screen.", "Penn... [fails] to give Stark enough charisma to convince as a vote-winning stalwart. Thus, the transformation of Stark hardly registers.", "There's a good movie in here somewhere but Zaillian's muddied storytelling and lack of focus hides it beyond recall.", "All the King's Men is a dull movie, mainly due to the fact that it is full of boring characters which are poorly written by writer/director Steven Zaillian and led by an underwhelming Jude Law.", "Static and dreary, drained of juice and drenched in \"respectable\" lighting", "\"All the King's Men\" is a grand scale embarrassment.", "Mesmo que n\u00e3o o comparemos ao cl\u00e1ssico de 49, este filme constrange pelo roteiro confuso, pela montagem artificial, pelas atua\u00e7\u00f5es decepcionantes e pela trilha excessiva, salvando-se apenas a bela fotografia.", "...a lush melodrama about the corruptibility of us all.", "A \"shouty\" film... a bit too long, a bit heavy handed with the rhetoric.", "Leaves out too much of the story to really work. Why are these people doing what they're doing? If I hadn't seen the 1949 version first, I would not have known.", "As much an old-fashioned potboiler as it is a political morality tale.", "It's beautifully shot, acted and designed, but there's little cohesion in the story.", "We have a series of beautiful threads weaved together in such haphazard fashion that, despite their potential, form a surprisingly ugly quilt.", "What should have been an incisive study of the American political scene turns out a lumbering celluloid white elephant.", "Penn is terrific and the production values are impressive, but All the King's Men gets lost in a poorly-structured, overly complicated plot that fails to engage.", "A Louisiana swamp of overacting and muddled plotlines sinks this cumbersome new version of Robert Penn Warren's political thriller.", "The film isn't dreadful: it is just generally disappointing.", "It's a typical politician's tale -- all talk and no action."], "rating": ["", "3/10", "", "2/5", "6/10", "2/5", "", "D", "1/5", "8/10", "C+", "6", "", "3/5", "2/4", "", "2/5", "1/5", "", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Mike Massie", "David Lamble", "Kaleem Aftab", "Joshua Starnes", "Matthew Pejkovic", "Fernando F.
