It's all easy, loping group shots following people from place to place.", "It's a consistently watchable mix of laughs, love, and heartbreak.", "It's a movie about contradictions which i think is really interesting.", "It can be faulted as a narrative and it doesn't take a serious moral view. But the people who querulously insist on such points have clearly not surrendered to Miss Hepburn's magic spell.", "The crossroads of Fifties and Sixties, party and hangover and romanticism and desperation lustrously distributed across the widescreen by Blake Edwards", "An unusual love story, glamorous, sophisticated, with more than a touch of the bizarre.", "...a captivating romantic comedy that lives up to its place as a classic of the genre.", "Audrey Hepburn gives one of her most stylish and iconic performances in this charming if slightly sentimental version of Truman Capote's famous novella.", "Well, the movie still looks very good, and you'd need a heart of stone not to love the cat.", "Blake Edwards's hymn to New York high style and high living with its charming heroine, along with her cat (called \"Cat\") and those wonderful Johnny Mercer Moon River lyrics, has hardly dated since its release.", "It's as ditsy and delightful as ever - with charm enough to forgive it plenty.", "Its charms remain undiminished after five decades, despite Mickey Rooney's Mr Yunioshi...", "Fabulous, but lots of drinking and cigarettes.", "An undeniably romantic tale of damaged goods finding love.", "Whatever it is, I just don't see the pizzazz in Holly Golightly's life.", "...the final scene, a tender sequence that you can sop up with a sponge, but if you aren't moved by it you probably stick kittens with pins.", "When it comes to cinematic fashion and romance, perhaps none are more iconic than Blake Edwards' Breakfast at Tiffany's.", "...a more ordinary movie than I remembered, with its clunky bits and a story that seems to betray authorial intent. Holly Golightly is not about the conventional American dream of domestic paradise; she is about the American perquisite of reinvention", "...the movie maintains a spirited bounce in its step that is still infectious today.", "It's like getting two movies for the price of one %u2013 light romantic comedy and a relatively effective human drama at the same time."], "rating": ["", "7/10", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "A-", "3/5", "5/5", "3/5", "4/5", "5/5", "4/5", "2.5/5", "", "", "8", "7/10", "8"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["A.S.
