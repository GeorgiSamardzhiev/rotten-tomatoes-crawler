{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In Berlin in 1931, American cabaret singer Sally Bowles (Liza Minnelli) meets British academic Brian Roberts (Michael York), who is finishing his university studies. Despite Brian's confusion over his sexuality, the pair become lovers, but the arrival of the wealthy and decadent playboy Maximilian von Heune (Helmut Griem) complicates matters for them both. This love triangle plays out against the rise of the Nazi party and the collapse of the Weimar Republic.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "2h 4m", "director": "Bob Fosse", "studio": "AmericanBroadcastingCompany(ABC),ABCCircleFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2008", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["I was an instant convert to Fosse's Cabaret: it was and is nothing but the movie for me. It concentrates Fosse's interest in stories about style-its power to define and transform, to dominate and subdue.", "The main characters' inebriated antics never seem to amount to anything potent or moving or simply involving.", "The bright, manic glee is countered by small moments of stunning brutality, moments that increase in frequency, size, and viciousness as the film progresses.", "Liza Minnelli and Joel Grey are electrifying; director Bob Fosse's choreography and the camera work are scintillating.", "If brash Minnelli seems a mite too talented for the Sally Bowles character, it really doesn't matter: she is, quite simply, magnificent in this role.", "Cabaret (1972) is director/choreographer Bob Fosse's defining, decadent, award-winning musical which popularized the phrase: \"Life is a Cabaret.\" It was only Fosse's second film, but won numerous accolades...", "The Bowles cycle is a gruesomely instructive guide to our worst show biz conventions.", "A truly great movie adapted from truly great source material, but it achieves most of its greatness by thoroughly gutting and re-imagining that source.", "\"The Nazi musical,\" as star Liza Minnelli glibly put it, has felt pertinent for a long time.", "It's an all-time masterpiece, mercurial and timeless. I am changed every time I see it.", "Cabaret is in some respects a typical feel-good musical, yet it's also so much deeper than that.", "Influential '70s musical features sex and mature themes.", "Let's just say it: the best thing going in director Bob Fosse's tour de force is Joel Grey. As the Master of Ceremonies at the infamous Berlin Kit-Kat club, Grey steals every scene he's in and makes us hope for more.", "Bob Fosse's direction is as chaotic as it was in his previous Sweet Charity, a desperate scramble after a style.", "simply masterful in every way", "A great classic film.", "The screenplay, which never seems to talk down to an audience while at the same time making its candid points with tasteful emphasis, returns the story to a variety of settings.", "Whatever this 1972 feature is, it's entertaining and stylish, though maybe not quite as serious as it wants to be.", "After a decade of stagnant musicals, Fosse reenergized the genre with a dazzling, socially conscious musical, which was more reflective of the 1970s zeitgeist than the Nazi era. Liza Minnelli is brilliant in what's the best role of her career.", "Superbly choreographed by Fosse, the cabaret numbers evoke the Berlin of 1931 - city of gaiety and perversion, of champagne and Nazi propaganda - so vividly that only an idiot could fail to perceive that something is rotten in the state of Weimar."], "rating": ["", "3/10", "B+", "4/5", "5/5", "A+", "", "5/5", "", "4/4", "3.5/4", "5/5", "4.5/5", "", "5/5", "5/5", "", "", "A-", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Michelle Orange", "Mike Massie", "Brent McKnight", "Kim Newman", "Tony Sloman", "Tim Dirks", "Wilfrid Sheed", "Tim Brayton", "Rob Vaux", "Walter Chaw", "Mike McGranaghan", "Sierra Filucci", "James Wegg", "Jay Cocks", "Rich Cline", "Cole Smithey", "Variety Staff", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Emanuel Levy", ""], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">4Columns", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmsite", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New York Review of Books", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternate Ending", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema-stache", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Freak Central", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Aisle Seat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">JWR", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Shadows on the Wall", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out"], "date": ["September 18, 2020", "August 27, 2020", "July 16, 2020", "June 12, 2020", "June 12, 2020", "September 29, 2019", "January 10, 2018", "August 19, 2017", "August 15, 2017", "June 7, 2013", "February 8, 2013", "January 4, 2010", "July 22, 2009", "August 12, 2008", "April 20, 2008", "October 25, 2007", "June 27, 2007", "June 27, 2007", "January 11, 2007", "June 24, 2006"]}}
