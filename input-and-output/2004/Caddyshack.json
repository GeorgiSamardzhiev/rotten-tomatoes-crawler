{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Danny Noonan (Michael O'Keefe), a teen down on his luck, works as a caddy at the snob-infested Bushwood Country Club to raise money for his college education.

Meanwhile, Danny struggles to prepare for the high pressure Caddy Day golf tournament while absorbing New Age advice from wealthy golf guru Ty Webb (Chevy Chase).", "rating": "73", "genre": "Comedy/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Harold Ramis", "studio": "OrionPictures", "theater_date": "Jul 25, 1980", "dvd_date": "Oct 14, 2008", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Still demonstrates an eye for superb comedic timing.", "\"Caddyshack\" is an above average example of the over-inflated B-movie gag film genre because of its expert performances.", "Should have put the gopher to work on the script.", "The humor in this film is very high-yield.

By now, all certainly should have outgrown their sophomoric tendencies but viewing the film makes one wonder.", "I love the madness in this film. It celebrates the triumph of the underdogs, the eccentrics and even the downright dangerous.", "Harold Ramis' directorial debut may be messy at times but Caddyshack's zany moments are enough to overcome the faults.", "Caddyshack represents everything that is wrong with contemporary film comedy.", "Caddyshack has a low-budget look that warmly welcomes the all-important teenage audience.", "To attempt a critical evaluation of Orion's new Caddyshack is a little like describing the esthetic qualities of an outhouse.", "Essentially Animal House on the links, it's neither as raucous nor as outrageous as that definitive college comedy but it has the same rebellious spirit and a great cast of comedy legends showing the young co-stars how it's done.", "There is a plot to this enjoyably erratic comedy... But basically it's a framework on which the writers, two of whom (Harold Ramis and Douglas Kenney) are Animal House alumni, can hang vulgar, obvious, yet often amusing gags.", "Caddyshack, a derelict farce that lurches about in search of hilarious possibilities among the members and employes of a country club, is the latest misbegotten spawn of National Lampoon's Animal House.", "There's still a lot of fun in this movie, and most of that comes from the heartfelt performances from the cast.", "A funny slapstick comedy, starring Billy Murray in top form", "Classic '80s comedy; not for kids.", "Never mind the fact that the plot regularly goes off track and into the rough, Caddyshack offers laughs a plenty.", "dependant almost entirely--when it's not being angry and cynical--on arrogance and smugness.", "Given the short shelf life of many rude 'n' crude Hollywood comedies, it's amazing how well Caddyshack stands up after all these years.", "Despite being ungainly, Caddyshack is the kind of comedy you can pan for gold in...
