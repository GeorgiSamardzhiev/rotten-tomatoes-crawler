It is these people who are bringing spite into it.", "Each frame of the film seems infused with vibrant life, even when the tone switches from dark to darker.", "For all its stunt casting and knee-jerk sexual frankness, Closer gives an underlying resonance to an emotional world that is normally the preserve of glossy soap operas.", "Closer takes the traditional notion of romance and attempts to batter it into submission, mostly through the constant application of swear words.", "The heart isn't a fist any more than the hand is a foot, and anyway there's no fist so tight that doesn't unfold into an open hand sometime. The movie is like a comedy someone dipped in a solvent.", "Searing story of betrayal isn't for kids.", "Closer is no joke and it's got the brave, mature performances of an all-star cast to prove it. It's a movie in which characters feel each other up with their hands and knock each other down with words.", "With a better script, Closer could have been compelling romantic drama; instead, it's little more than clich\u00e9d nonsense.", "Nichols ... simply stuns with a beautiful production, excellent script, unconventional and rather hateful story, and excellent acting all around.", "Mike Nichols teases up a similar level of emotional dysfunction to \"Carnal Knowledge\" with a filmic rendition of Patrick Marber's stage play about sexual one-ups-man-ship.", "Like dramas by Pinter and others, what seems trenchant and perfectly pitched in the theater can come off as arch even when skillfully transferred to film.", "Four beautiful, despicable characters find everything but love in this borderline sadistic battle of words from Mike Nichols.", "It's only as good as its cast. Fortunately, it's a good cast.", "Marber looks at farcical giddiness with a hard-won sobriety....
