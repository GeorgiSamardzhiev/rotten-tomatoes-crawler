{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the fast-paced world of NASCAR, a rivalry brews between rookie hotshot Cole Trickle (Tom Cruise) and veteran racer Rowdy Burns (Michael Rooker). When both of them are seriously injured in competition, the former bitter rivals become close friends. With Cole's spirits restored by a romance with neurosurgeon Dr. Claire Lewicki (Nicole Kidman), and Rowdy still sidelined by injuries, Cole decides to race Rowdy's car in the Daytona 500 against underhanded newcomer Russ Wheeler (Cary Elwes).", "rating": "38", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Tony Scott", "studio": "ParamountPictures,DonSimpson/JerryBruckheimerFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$80.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A vanity piece for Tom Cruise, who makes sure that he looks even prettier than co-star Nicole Kidman.", "The most awesome technical feat of Days of Thunder's massive gadgetry is Cruise in close-up.", "For race car enthusiasts, Days of Thunder is a treat with great action scenes.", "The only historically noteworthy thing about this big, dumb testosterone fantasy is the first screen teaming of Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.", "[It] was not so much about innovation and originality as it was about recycling the same themes about the glories of victory and the triumph of professionalism, which Days of Thunder produces in droves, but without any real impact.", "The most daring thing about his cat-and-mouse game with Kidman is how erotic Noyce makes it.", "A Formula One stock car racing flick that's formulaic and cliche-ridden.", "'90s race-car blockbuster has sexism, profanity.", "Dispensing with all notions that Days of Thunder is a critical work of any sort reveals its hollow and misogynistic underpinnings.", "Like the previous Simpson-Bruckheimer pictures, it's designed to give audiences an overdose of the thrill of victory; it wants us to jump out of our seats, pumping our fists in the air and roaring for the hero to pulverize his opponents.", "This is the kind of monstrously overgrown commercial movie that depends entirely on the microscopic pleasures of having one`s most routine expectations fulfilled.", "Whoosh!! Days of Thunder just streaked in, fast as a race-car paint job and about as flat.", "Not only does Days of Thunder disappoint on the basic narrative level, it is also a peculiarly thrill-less action movie. Shot from the driver's point of view, the race sequences lose their novelty as swiftly as a video game.", "Days of Thunder does accomplish the job it sets out to do. It's sometimes funny, sometimes exciting and never too boring or offensive. In a disappointing movie season -- as this one has started out to be -- that can seem like quite an accomplishment.", "Good writing by Robert Towne and a host of strong supporting performances complement the on-the-track visuals of director Tony Scott in giving us a sense of the leap of faith that is required by drivers at this level.", "The original script must have been truly atrocious if Towne's contributions can be considered an improvement.", "The nerve of these people, recycling that story. No, the shrewdness of these people.", "Whatever they call this movie, it's nothing more than a puffed-up sequel to Top Gun. If you saw Top Gun, you can anticipate every twist and turn, every screeching spinout of Days of Thunder.", "Days of Thunder wants to be an action drama, but it's really just a star vehicle of the most rudimentary sort, with nothing to offer Cruise except a chance to look pretty and chant time-tested punchlines.", "It's hard to enjoy a movie that is so predictable. Every time there's a race, you know who's going to win.
