{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this musical, college student Justin (Justin Guarini) arrives in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., for spring break with his friends Brandon (Greg Siff) and Eddie (Brian Dietzen), and quickly crosses paths with waitress Kelly (Kelly Clarkson). Although Justin falls for Kelly almost instantly, Kelly's jealous friend, Alexa (Katherine Bailess), tries her best to keep the two apart. With the help of several song-and-dance numbers, however, Justin and Kelly eventually connect and make sweet music together.", "rating": "10", "genre": "Comedy/Musical & Performing Arts/Television/Romance", "runtime": "1h 21m", "director": "Robert Iscove", "studio": "19Entertainment", "theater_date": "Jun 20, 2003", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$4.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Fans may enjoy their Idol songs and parents may appreciate its wholesomeness, but there's little else to recommend in this throwback to the '60s Beach Blanket movies.", "What's depressing about From Justin to Kelly, whose title seems to refer to the text messages he sends her, is that it's been made without a lick of love, skill, or, apparently, money.", "From Justin to Kelly is a musical so pedestrian it trips over its feet every time someone breaks into song or dance.", "Easily the worst beach movie ever made.", "Idol film expands 15 minutes of fame.", "Television propelled teen idolatry -- the kind that Moses would probably have disapproved -- gets its ugly comeuppance...", "This is such a manipulative product placing piece of dribble that it reeks of failure.", "More than anything, From Justin To Kelly needs Simon Cowell.", "", "Is it too late to vote them off? For once, we don't have to tell you how bad a film is... you knew before they made it.", "The movie is billed as a romantic musical comedy. You coulda fooled me.", "Watching them lock lips feels like incest propaganda: Justin and Kelly are offspring of the same publicity machinery, after all", "From Justin to Kelly is bad, but Glitter is still worse because Glitter thinks it's a great movie.", "How bad is From Justin to Kelly? Set in Miami during spring break, it's like Grease: The Next Generation acted out by the food-court staff at SeaWorld.", "From Justin to Kelly is just one of those films, a bottomless well of snark fodder that may come and go in theatres but will surely be spun innumerable times on DVD at parties in the years to come.", "Moulin Rouge ... Chicago ... From Justin to Kelly ... two steps forward and then about 16 steps back for the film musical.", "Fans of the television show may show up for this one, but given that an American Idol sequel has already ended its run, audiences are likely to find it stale.", "It's more dumbfounding that so much time is wasted on a cast of unknowns, second-stringers granted solos long before Kelly or Justin take center stage. Why not support with other first-season alums?", "The notion behind it is as contrived, forced, manipulated and fake as any film ever made.", "Having won first and second place in some sort of TV talent show, Kelly Clarkson and Justin Guarini get to play movie star, a bonus all America should immediately vote to have removed from the prize bin."], "rating": ["1.5/4", "1/4", "", "", "2/5", "D-", "", "", "2/5", "F", "2/10", "0/4", "1.5/5", "F", "0/4", "0/5", "2.5/5", "2/5", "F", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["M.
