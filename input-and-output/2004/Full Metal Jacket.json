{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Stanley Kubrick's take on the Vietnam War follows smart-aleck Private Davis (Matthew Modine), quickly christened \"Joker\" by his foul-mouthed drill sergeant (R. Lee Ermey), and pudgy Private Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), nicknamed \"Gomer Pyle,\" as they endure the rigors of basic training. Though Pyle takes a frightening detour, Joker graduates to the Marine Corps and is sent to Vietnam as a journalist, covering -- and eventually participating in -- the bloody Battle of Hu\u00e9.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "Stanley Kubrick", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,Natant", "theater_date": "Jun 1, 1987", "dvd_date": "Aug 15, 2008", "box_office": "$42.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A hard-hitting movie laced with moments of dark humour and brimming with social commentary, Full Metal Jacket is viewed as one of the all-time great war movie.", "Kubrick had a way of making the audience become invested in the characters of his films and created some truly memorable ones.", "It was a gross injustice that Ermey was not nominated for his tremendous performance.", "A nicely contrasting soundtrack, intense action sequences, mesmerizing sets, excellent photography, and believable characters contribute to this poignant thriller.", "Full Metal Jacket is a master study in indoctrination and fundamental identity shifts. Every moment of the film builds and builds on Kubrick's ideas...", "We look to the director for some judgment, or even an indication of his opinion, as to whether his carnage artists are born or made; but we don't get it.", "An electrifying opening segment that could stand alone as one of Kubrick's great films, except it's only about 45 minutes long.", "Full Metal Jacket seems further proof that Kubrick is still trapped in self-pleasing cinematic exercise.", "Full Metal Jacket, produced, directed and co-written by Stanley Kubrick, is not an easy film to watch, but from the first frame to the last, it is a riveting one.", "One of the classics of war cinema, it's not nearly as good as its legend suggests. But it's pretty good.", "[Kubrick's] genius, and perhaps burden, is to see the insanity in us all and to make it seem so terrifyingly normal.", "...a justifiably iconic war film.", "One of Kubrick's foremost triumphs, a genuinely challenging and uncomfortable war film", "No amount of stylistic analysis, however, is likely to explain why a man would devote more than three years of his life to making a war movie in which violent death isn't meant to move us. Does Kubrick really think we're not callous enough about war?", "While its message is simple -- innocent young Americans are taught to be machine-like killers -- its technique is extraordinary.", "If a film doesn't give us people, it has to offer a substitute -- an idea, a style, a vision. Full Metal Jacket comes up blank.", "If his considerable achievement in this long- awaited film falls short of his Olympian standards, there is a reason that ought to give Kubrick some satisfaction. The world has caught up with Kubrick and what he has to say.", "Relentlessly harsh in its images and language, Full Metal Jacket is nonetheless the most artful film yet made about the Vietnam War.", "It may seem too spare, too clinical, its moments of war even too familiar for some. But, aiming for minds as well as hearts, Kubrick hits his target squarely.", "Full Metal Jacket is a great motion picture. Be warned, however, that it is harsh and explicit."], "rating": ["5/5", "4.5/5", "3.5/4", "8/10", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "1-5", "", "3.5/4", "1", "", "5/5", "", "3/4", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Andrew Pollard", "Allison Rose", "Richard Propes", "Mike Massie", "Ed Travis", "Hilary Mantel", "Jack Garner", "Stanley Kauffmann", "Cathy Burke", "John Rico", "Peter Travers", "David Nusair", "Tim Brayton", "Terrence Rafferty", "Adrian Turner", "Ben Yagoda", "Desmond Ryan", "David Sterritt", "Sheila Benson", "Roger Hurlburt"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Starburst", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">FlickDirect", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Jesus", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gannett News Service", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New Republic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">United Press International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">About.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Nation", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel"], "date": ["September 24, 2020", "September 22, 2020", "September 8, 2020", "September 6, 2020", "March 31, 2020", "April 9, 2019", "February 9, 2019", "November 6, 2017", "October 9, 2016", "October 25, 2015", "June 24, 2015", "January 9, 2015", "July 5, 2014", "June 21, 2013", "June 21, 2013", "June 21, 2013", "June 21, 2013", "June 21, 2013", "June 21, 2013", "June 21, 2013"]}}
