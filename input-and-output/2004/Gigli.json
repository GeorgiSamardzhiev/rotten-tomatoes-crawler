When plans go awry, Gigli's boss sends in Ricki (Jennifer Lopez), a gorgeous free-spirited female gangster who has her own set of orders to assist with the kidnapping.

Nay, worse.", "To qualify as a historic failure, a film needs a measure of pretension and all Gigli ever wanted to be was a romantic comedy. What it is is a dreadful romantic comedy.", "Mere words fail to express the awfulness of Martin Brest's Gigli.", "Now we can see why the Jennifer Lopez-Ben Affleck marriage was called off. It was on grounds of unreasonable cruelty to audiences.", "Overlong, plodding, tone-deaf, unfunny and preposterous.", "The two stars may be in love in real life, but they've managed to keep that chemistry well-hidden on screen.", "It comes to something when a movie is only worth watching to validate just how dreadful it is.", "This misguided romantic comedy goes wrong so often and in such profoundly lunkheaded ways that to say it stinks would be bordering on polite understatement.", "After the schadenfreudian thrill of watching beautiful people humiliate themselves wears off, it has the same annihilating effect on your will to live.", "Nothing in Gigli is sustained, from pace to plot points to character functions. It appears to have been chopped up and put back together again more than once.", "Here is a film that exists on another plane. It is so insane, so misguided, so Dadaesque, so Kafkaesque, you'll think I'm exaggerating.
