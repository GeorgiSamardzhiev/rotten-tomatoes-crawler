{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Radio funny man Adrian Cronauer (Robin Williams) is sent to Vietnam to bring a little comedy back into the lives of the soldiers. After setting up shop, Cronauer delights the G.I.s but shocks his superior officer, Sergeant Major Dickerson (J.T. Walsh), with his irreverent take on the war. While Dickerson attempts to censor Cronauer's broadcasts, Cronauer pursues a relationship with a Vietnamese girl named Trinh (Chintara Sukapatana), who shows him the horrors of war first-hand.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h", "director": "Barry Levinson", "studio": "TouchstonePictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 23, 2013", "box_office": "$123.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Robin Williams has a role practically tailor made for his irreverent, yet uniquely sensitive personality.", "Robin Williams was finally given a showcase for his extraordinary improvisational skills in this, the first comedy set in Vietnam.", "The film is distinctive for being Hollywood's first Vietnam comedy and among the first movies to treat the Vietnamese themselves as real people.", "Tailor-made for Williams' manic improvisational mugging qualities.", "The film is all Williams; he has a field day with this character and this country and this period in history, with all its horror -- and comedy.", "Good Morning, Vietnam proved that Robin Williams could act and be hilariously funny in the same film.", "Robin Williams at his scatalogical finest.", "From the start, the film bowls you over with excitement and for those who can latch on, it's a nonstop ride.", "Levinson serio-comedy about Vietnam is first and foremost a star vehicle for comedian Robin Williams, who gives a manic, highly-charged performance as the real-life dj Adrian Cronauer in the early years of the War.", "", "A perfect showcase for Robin Williams.", "Good Morning Vietnam remains one of my favorite films about the Vietnam war because of its comedic take and ability to slip into real drama when needed.", "", "a story about a mere class clown becoming a man at the gates of Hell.", "", "Offering only hackneyed insights into the war, the film makes for stodgy drama. But Williams' manic monologues behind the mike are worth anybody's money.", "If you haven't seen this one in a while, definitely consider picking it up again.
