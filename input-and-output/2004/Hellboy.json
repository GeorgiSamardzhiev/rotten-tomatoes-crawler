{"metadata": {"synopsis": "At the end of World War II, the Nazis attempt to open a portal to a paranormal dimension in order to defeat the Allies, but are only able to summon a baby demon who is rescued by Allied forces and dubbed \"Hellboy\" (Ron Perlman).

But this is precisely what makes it tick.", "Ron Perlman, performing under a massive ember-red suit... is perfect as the cigar-puffing, wisecracking, kitten-loving demon who covertly battles supernatural monsters.", "Guillermo del Toro's best film yet.", "It would be quite impossible to claim is that the filmmaker's love of his subject isn't apparent throughout every lovingly-crafted frame.", "Probably one of the coolest comic book movies to come around in years...", "When the movie's story line concentrates on the character of Hellboy and his relationships with those important to him, the film becomes a unique romp, with an exciting yet vulnerable superhero at the center who just happens to be the spawn of Satan.", "The screenplay has flashes of real wit, and Perlman is perfect in the title role.", "Somewhat entertaining, but too scary for many.", "Inventive but derivative, well performed yet slightly hokey, visually lush yet over-stylised.", "Anyone can send an immense, computer-generated vegetable monster rampaging at the base of the Brooklyn Bridge, but it takes a special kind of imagination to do it in a way that's thrilling, emotionally complex, and rapturously beautiful all at once.", "High concept fantasy through the eyes of creative genius of Guillermo del Toro", "Hellboy both kicks butt and falls in love, in an adventure that is thrilling, funny and touching.", "A strong anti-superhero movie that turns the genre sideways.", "Del Toro and Perlman essentially make you forget that Hellboy's this bizarre creature because Perlman invests him with such humanity. And maybe what makes him most human are his flaws.", "Ron Perlman--the Lon Chaney of our time--plays Hellboy with grit, humor, and a depth of feeling which, barely, grounds the movie.", "They say the devil gets all the best tunes and, on the strength of this latest comicbook adaptation, he gets all the good one-liners, too.", "Artistically resonant even as it deliberately follows a contemporary narrative structure."], "rating": ["6/10", "4/5", "", "2/4", "", "4/5", "7/10", "", "", "3/4", "3/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "3/4", "", "3/4", "3/5", "B+"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Leigh Paatsch", "Graeme Tuckett", "Namrata Joshi", "Sean Axmaker", "Kevin Carr", "Tim Brayton", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Bruce Diones", "David Sterritt", "Nell Minow", "Garth Franklin", "Nathan Lee", "Louise Keller", "Mark Halverson", "Wesley Lovell", "Beth Accomando", "Peter Canavese", "Amber Wilkinson", "Rob Humanick"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Stuff.co.nz", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Outlook", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seanax.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fat Guys at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dark Horizons", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">NPR.org", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Urban Cinefile", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sacramento News &amp; Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Sight", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KPBS.org", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Groucho Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Eye for Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Projection Booth"], "date": ["September 29, 2020", "May 12, 2020", "April 22, 2019", "January 7, 2019", "January 13, 2017", "January 17, 2016", "August 26, 2013", "June 11, 2013", "April 14, 2013", "April 14, 2013", "December 24, 2010", "July 7, 2010", "October 18, 2008", "August 25, 2008", "August 7, 2008", "July 22, 2008", "July 10, 2008", "July 5, 2008", "June 13, 2008", "June 12, 2008"]}}
