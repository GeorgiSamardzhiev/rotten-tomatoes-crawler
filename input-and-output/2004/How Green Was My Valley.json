{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Huw Morgan (Roddy McDowall), the academically inclined youngest son in a proud family of Welsh coal miners, witnesses the tumultuous events of his young life during a period of rapid social change. At the dawn of the 20th century, a miners' strike divides the Morgans: the sons demand improvements, and the father (Donald Crisp) doesn't want to rock the boat. Meanwhile, Huw's eldest sister, Angharad (Maureen O'Hara), pines for the new village preacher, Mr. Gruffydd (Walter Pidgeon).", "rating": "89", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 58m", "director": "John Ford", "studio": "TwentiethCenturyFox", "theater_date": "Dec 27, 1941", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Strangely, a sizable portion of the plot occurs without Huw's direct involvement, which makes his narration somewhat flawed, since he's not privy to all the details.", "One of the most beautifully-shot films of the 1940s... one of the highest achievements of John Ford's fascination with the ebb and flow of life in a small community.", "You are left with a memory of something as fine as any motion picture could hope to be.", "It is a great picture, a poignant, emotion-stirring drama.", "The last John Ford movie is something exquisite and of a supreme artistic quality. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The film is beautifully played, with Donald Crisp as the humorous patriarch of the mining village dominating the screen with tough sensibility.", "Sentimental classic still tugs at the heartstrings.", "There are a lot of rich characters and good instances of moral outrage. It may not be better than Citizen Kane, but it's still a pretty damn good movie.", "Captures an idyll of youth that has been lost to the corrosive practices of modern business.", "There is no logical reason why you should feel as warm and nostalgic as you do at the end of How Green Was My Valley.", "One of the outstanding film productions of the year.", "This is precisely the kind of movie that gave Hollywood film-making dignity and supremacy in its heyday.", "The acting is strong, and Arthur Miller's Oscar-winning photography gives the images a spooky luster, but a little bit of Ford's salt-of-the-earth piety goes an awfully long way.", "A screen version of such a book is a bold project, but Darryl Zanuck as producer and John Ford as director have succeeded in capturing to a remarkable degree the atmosphere of the novel.", "Because his recollections ring true, they are certain to evoke a similar nostalgia in all but the most slab-sided of moviegoers.", "Beat out the much superior Citizen Kane for the Oscar for Best Picture.", "", "This John Huston film [is] typically epic with a faithful screenplay to Richard Llewellyn's famous novel.", "How Green Was My Valley is one of the year's better films, a sure-fire critic's picture and, unlike most features that draw kudos from crix, this one will also do business.", "A complex account of family life and strife that takes in traumas, hardships, romances, conflicts and the odd happy moment without ever sentimentalizing or becoming unbelievable."], "rating": ["2/10", "5/5", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "", "4/4", "", "5/5", "B", "", "", "B", "4/5", "4/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Tim Brayton", "Jay Carmody", "Josephine O&#39;Neill", "Elena de la Torre", "Edgar Anstey", "Andrea Beach", "Witney Seibold", "Richard Brody", "Josh Larsen", "Kate Cameron", "Tony Sloman", "Ty Burr", "Anthony Bower", "James Agee", "Dennis Schwartz", "Michael W.
