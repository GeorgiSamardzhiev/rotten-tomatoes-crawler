Despite his dark history with robotics, Detective Del Spooner (Will Smith) investigates the alleged suicide of U.S. Robotics founder Alfred Lanning (James Cromwell) and believes that a human-like robot (Alan Tudyk) murdered him. With the help of a robot expert (Bridget Moynahan), Spooner discovers a conspiracy that may enslave the human race.", "rating": "56", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Alex Proyas", "studio": "20thCenturyFox,LaurenceMarkProductions,DavisEntertainment,OverbrookEntertainment", "theater_date": "Jul 15, 2004", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$144.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The way in which the robots acrobatically leap about, as if immune to the effects of gravity, is the main offender.", "Some stirring action sequences and a fascinating futuristic setting keeps things entertaining, even if this loose adaptation of the Isaac Asimov doesn't always take the most original approach possible.", "...is it a good thing that the CGI robot was so much more interesting and believable than the (largely) human protagonist played by Will Smith? I think not. It somehow made the many shortcomings of the film seem even more apparent.", "The plot seemed forced to me, though average summer fare. What bothered me the most however, was the ending.", "Pardon me if I've seen this before.", "I have seen the future and it s an episode of Frasier gone very wrong. The worst episode, actually. Not that I, Robot is a bad film; quite the contrary, it s a shamelessly entertaining video game of a narrative, directed with style and energy.", "...it does operate with a crisp, impressive, nuts-and-bolts efficiency as its robots do their best song-and-dance to provide us with a smooth summer diversion.", "Leaving aside the sub-Matrix hokum about Spooner's sweet-potato-loving grandmom, the movie humiliates itself - and embarrasses us - by the amount of time it spends plugging a glamorous car...", "In the end, I, Robot is just an assembly-line product of a not very advanced model.", "He excels in creating alternative worlds and the one here sustains the film, with a pristine beauty that's attractive and slightly sinister.", "This sci-fi action adventure, loosely based on the writing of Isaac Asimov, is impressive for Patrick Tatopoulos's production design but depressive for the juiceless story.", "This may not delve as deeply as AI: Artificial Intelligence or Blade Runner, but director Alex Proyas keeps the action racing along with enough invention and thrills to make this well worth the ride.", "The problem with Robot is that it keeps reminding you of better, edgier flicks, notably Blade Runner, The Terminator and Minority Report, not to mention director Alex Proyas's own Dark City.", "It's not as dazzling or thrilling a blend between realism and fantasy as Minority Report or even Hollow Man, but it certainly is an easy film to watch and to at times get lost in.", "[I, Robot] somehow manages to overlook the subversive potential, and it's low on wit, coming up with a good-looking but ultimately inert movie with a feeble non-ending that gave me a pain in all the diodes down my left side.", "Given how hard it is to find new ideas in mainstream screen sci-fi these days, the film does a creditable job of repackaging standard speculative circuitry under a sleek new blockbuster carapace.", "I, Robot is far less concerned with bellowing an Orwellian socio-political warning than with giving Will Smith enough robots to bash apart and send flying across elaborate sets.", "It's much more of an action flick than either Metropolis or Blade Runner, but there's a provocative and visionary side to this free adaptation of Isaac Asimov's SF classic that puts it in the same thoughtful canon.", "While the shiny props and impressive effects lend high-tech glamour, it is the fine balance of action, character, and an old-school detective story that enable Alex Proyas' impressive sci-fi movie to cross the boundaries of genre.", "The result is a cluttered, awkward blockbuster that's just smart enough to get itself into trouble."], "rating": ["7/10", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "3/5", "2/5", "", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Leigh Paatsch", "Kathi Maio", "Sr. Rose Pacatte", "Todd Leopold", "Christopher Borrelli", "Dennis King", "Sukhdev Sandhu", "Richard Corliss", "Paul Byrnes", "Joe Morgenstern", "Tom Hutchinson", "People Staff", "Megan Spencer", "Peter Bradshaw", "Jonathan Romney", "Andy Bailey", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Louisa McLennan", "Scott Tobias"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sister Rose at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNN.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Toledo Blade", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sydney Morning Herald", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">sbs.com.au", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent on Sunday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club"], "date": ["September 30, 2020", "June 19, 2020", "February 28, 2020", "April 1, 2019", "April 1, 2019", "April 1, 2019", "April 1, 2019", "April 1, 2019", "April 1, 2019", "April 1, 2019", "April 1, 2019", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018", "December 15, 2018"]}}
