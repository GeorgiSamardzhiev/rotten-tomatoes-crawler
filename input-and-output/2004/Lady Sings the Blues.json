Furie seem to feel that the slower the song, the more serious the mood, so at times the film seems to be grinding almost to a halt", "How is it possible for a movie that is otherwise so dreadful to contain such a singularly attractive performance in the title role?", "", "Great score, great singing, but overdramatic thanks to Ross.", "The movie is filled with many of the great Billie Holiday songs, and Ross handles them in an interesting way.
