{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Following the death of his wife, Los Angeles police detective Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson) becomes reckless and suicidal. When he is reassigned and partnered with Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover), Riggs immediately clashes with the older officer. Together they uncover a massive drug-trafficking ring. As they encounter increasingly dangerous situations, Riggs and Murtaugh begin to form a bond. Riggs' volatile behavior might just help them apprehend the criminals -- if it doesn't kill them both first.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Richard Donner", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,SilverPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 15, 2008", "box_office": "$61.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An enduring buddy film, brilliantly combining drama, comedy, adventure, bloodshed, machine gun showdowns in the middle of busy highways, and excessive property destruction.", "My problem with Lethal Weapon is I did not love the script or the action", "...it's not difficult to see why Riggs and Murtaugh became downright iconic figures after the release of this picture...", "Richard Donner directed with an expert eye for action but impaired vision for logic.", "... creates a new type of hero... [Full review in Spanish]", "Unfortunately, while Black's assembled all the parts, he's not locked in the conflict early enough, and the good scenes simply aren't enough good to make up for the plot's too-late lock.", "[Gibson and Glover] make a great team, and some of their early adventures are exciting. But the film runs out of gas as it turns into an extended chase sequence.", "At center is the first big, juicy mythic-hero part Gibson has had since Mad Max.", "What this premise needs is a serviceable plot, but screenwriter Shane Block hasn't provided one. Indeed, for an action thriller, Lethal Weapon is unacceptably slow.", "The story, which proceeds with inevitability, is enlivened by Donner's rousing action sequences.", "Implausibility is a large part of the entertainment in this romp par excellence, with each overblown set piece becoming ever more ludicrous.", "Thanks to a peculiar chemistry and a terrific script, Mel Gibson and Danny Glover lift this movie above mere TV-cop fodder.", "Nothing, however, can really prepare audiences for the generally good, though offbeat, performances, gritty action and serio-comic exploits of the Good Guys vs. the Bad Guys.", "As action-adventure, it's pointlessly puerile, a movie where the heroes are so childish they try to one-up each other with fancy shots at the pistol range.", "What does it say that I loved it as a boy of fourteen?", "Yeah, I know, I know: It's considered an action classic and routinely pegged as one of the best \"buddy cop\" films, but it's always held just marginal appeal for me -- besides, compare it to Die Hard, and its \"classic\" status seems even more ludicrous.", "Mismatched cops spar in violent '80s action hit.", "From a distance, Lethal Weapon might appear generic, but a closer look reveals something special.", "A phenomenally successful, noisy, violent buddy movie."], "rating": ["8/10", "4/10", "3/4", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "3/4", "4/5", "", "2.5/4", "0.5/4", "2/4", "2.5/4", "3/5", "3.5/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Rachel Wagner", "David Nusair", "Bob Thomas", "Jordi Batlle Caminal", "Duane Byrge", "Gene Siskel", "Michael Wilmington", "Ben Yagoda", "Desmond Ryan", "John Marriott", "Ralph Novak", "Roger Hurlburt", "Johanna Steinmetz", "Walter Chaw", "Matt Brunson", "Elliot Panek", "James Berardinelli", ""], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Freak Central", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ReelViews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4"], "date": ["September 6, 2020", "May 25, 2020", "December 24, 2019", "July 25, 2019", "March 14, 2018", "March 6, 2017", "December 13, 2014", "December 6, 2013", "December 6, 2013", "December 6, 2013", "December 6, 2013", "December 6, 2013", "May 13, 2013", "May 13, 2013", "August 12, 2012", "June 14, 2012", "January 1, 2011", "July 7, 2009", "August 25, 2008"]}}
