{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Meek flower shop assistant Seymour (Rick Moranis) pines for co-worker Audrey (Ellen Greene). During a total eclipse, he discovers an unusual plant he names Audrey II, which feeds only on human flesh and blood.

After Seymour feeds Audrey's boyfriend, Orin (Steve Martin), to the plant after Orin's accidental death, he must come up with more bodies for the increasingly bloodthirsty plant.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Comedy/Horror/Musical & Performing Arts/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Frank Oz", "studio": "GeffenPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 15, 2008", "box_office": "$36.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Ellen Greene shows off her formidable singing ability, while Steve Martin is hilarious as the sadistic dentist Orin Scrivello.", "Levi Stubbs's big voice explodes from the insatiable plant, and there's a knockout turn by Steve Martin and Bill Murray as a sadistic dentist and his masochistic patient.", "A pulp pop twist on the original Roger Corman horror comedy that's funny, fun, catchy, and well worth its reputation.", "Some of the slower tunes tend to grind but the sort of musical/ retro irony is still amusing in places.
