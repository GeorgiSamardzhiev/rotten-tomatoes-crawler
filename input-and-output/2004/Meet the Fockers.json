{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Now that Greg Focker is \"in\" with his soon-to-be in-laws, Jack and Dina Byrnes, it looks like smooth sailing for him and his fianc\u00e9e, Pam. But that's before Pam's parents meet Greg's parents, the Fockers. The hyper-relaxed Fockers and the tightly-wound Byrneses are woefully mismatched from the start, and no matter how hard Greg and Pam try, there is just no bringing their families together. This all adds up to a disastrously funny time of getting to know you.", "rating": "39", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Jay Roach", "studio": "TribecaProductions", "theater_date": "Dec 22, 2004", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$279.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The humor stays approximately the same, largely thanks to the screenwriters (Jim Herzfeld and John Hamburg) returning for this second chapter.", "\"Meet the Fockers\" is such a great assemblage of talent.", "Dodging any aspirations to satire or drama, Meet the Fockers is an intricately wrought, barely credible sitcom, but it's also as gratingly one note as a whoopee cushion.", "Every big comic setpiece plays like an idea for a comic setpiece rather than the finished article.", "Although the ingredients are all there, set to rise, something is missing, some crucial element to lift it up.", "Sequel to the mediocre Ben Stiller comedy \"Meet The Parents\" is a bawdier but inferior movie that relies on the star power of Dustin Hoffman and Barbara Streisand as Stiller's Florida-dwelling Jewish hippie parents Bernie and Roz to fuel its ill-timed toi", "", "A consistently entertaining, sometimes uproariously funny film.", "Repeats itself and strains for laughs where the original giddily stumbled through them.", "Milk bottles and related metaphors feature prominentlyas breast fetish stand-ins, but with a decidely peculiar asymmetrical preference for just the left one.", "Has its smattering of laughs, but the new faces bring fewer dividends than the elemental De Niro/Ben Stiller showdown of the original.", "full review in Greek", "Meet the Fockers is frequently funny, but it turns a bit too cruel in the third act to be as worthy a sequel to its predecessor as it could have been", "This sequel's title indicates the content: smutty, silly and liable to make you smirk despite yourself.", "Fans of the first will find some amusement in familiarity, but with such a comically able cast this is a missed opportunity.", "The expected misunderstandings ensue, as you'd expect, which would be pretty excruciating if not for the performances of Hoffman and Streisand.", "Meet The Fockers has assembled a historic, once-in-a-lifetime cast, then stranded them in the laziest, most mercenary kind of sequel imaginable.
