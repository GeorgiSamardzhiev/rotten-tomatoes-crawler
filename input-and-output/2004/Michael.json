This time it's in a horror film.", "Objective, analytic, clinical, dispassionate-these are not words often used to describe something so engrossing and gripping.", "A strange and agonizingly engrossing drama despite its repellent subject.", "Michael does have undeniable moral purpose. It forces us to ponder the way society chooses - another easy option - to comfortingly reclassify such perpetrators as monsters.", "Haneke without the soul, and if you've seen enough of that man's pictures, you can maybe perceive how unsettling the idea of a soulless Haneke sounds.", "Intentionally unnerving from the first moments, it's a hard movie to watch, but it's also fantastically, agonizingly suspenseful.", "Mostly the picture is blank, a credible series of scenes that invite us to make of it what we will.", "A brave, unavoidably distressing debut from Markus Schleinzer, sensitively acted and directed.", "Michael has been forged in the Haneke mould, treating its incendiary material with an aloof, banalising calm and withholding any overt judgment or moral standpoint.", "I can't recommend anyone shares 90 minutes of their life with Michael.", "There is a film to be made, grim and explorative, about paedophile abduction. Michael isn't it.", "Schleinzer could hardly have chosen a more difficult subject, but he treats it with an unnerving simplicity, shorn of sensationalism or obvious moral cues.", "The film is not merely a chilling insight into the day-to-day banality of evil, but also an unbearably suspenseful and tense drama.", "Impressively directed and superbly written, this is a powerful and chilling drama with a terrific central performance from Michael Fuith.", "There are no easy conclusions here - no explanations. Events unfold with a random, even black comic abandon.", "As horrifying and hard to watch as you'd expect a paedophile's-eye view of life to be.
