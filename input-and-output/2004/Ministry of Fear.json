{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Fresh from a two-year stint in a mental institution for the alleged \"mercy killing\" of his ailing wife, Stephen Neale (Ray Milland) visits a carnival where he wins a cake by guessing its weight. The cake, however, contains a microfilm sought after by Nazi spies, and Stephen soon finds himself a target. On the run and unsure of whom to trust, he enlists the help of a private detective (Erskine Sanford), a beautiful woman (Marjorie Reynolds) and an inspector from Scotland Yard (Percy Waram).", "rating": "88", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 25m", "director": "Fritz Lang", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 12, 2013", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["While the s\u00e9ance sequence ultimately plays like a slapdash sequence from Clue, it is Lang's artistry that really elevates Ministry of Fear from a meandering espionage noir.", "An astonishing combination of clumsy, false adaptation, unsure direction, and mis-casting, has changed Greene's Ministry of Fear into an ordinary spy film, with a few expensive and Hitchcock flourishes.", "Lang at his finest and purest.", "Fritz Lang turns this into a creepily effective work, full of bravura set pieces and subtle suggestions.", "Uncertainty and fear of the unknown are the hallmarks of this classic film noir by master director Lang, which, until the last revelation, is guaranteed to puzzle and chill the viewer.", "Adept at using cinema for art and entertainment since his early career, Lang treats this Graham Greene \"entertainment\" in modest, yet effective fashion.", "This is not Lang's best film of the era, or even his most interesting portrait of paranoia and malevolent forces, but it is a lively thriller with unexpected turns.", "The film as a whole doesn't really stick with you, but isolated moments and images do", "It's not top-shelf Fritz Lang, nor is it top-level Graham Greene, but as an exercise in World War II intrigue with a smidgen of film noir thrown in, Ministry of Fear gets the job done.", "It's certainly fitting that after filling his German years with ballsy, predictive masterpieces about Nazi rule-by-fear, Fritz Lang would finally make a film that directly involves Nazis.", "Visually brilliant masterpiece.", "Fritz Lang, a master at getting the most out of mystery, intrigue and melodrama, in his direction apparently didn't have his way from beginning to end on Ministry of Fear.", "This is a wonderfully atmospheric, almost expressionistic thriller, packed with memorable moments.", "Plant yourself well in a firm seat and keep your over-coat on when you go to see this thriller, for it dumps you and douses you fast.", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "rating": ["", "", "", "3/5", "4/4", "9/10", "", "3/4", "3/4", "5", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "5/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "Josephine O&#39;Neill", "Dave Kehr", "Adrian Turner", "", "Matthew Sorrento", "Sean Axmaker", "James Kendrick", "Matt Brunson", "Gabe Leibowitz", "Michael E.
