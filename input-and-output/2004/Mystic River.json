{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When the daughter (Emmy Rossum) of ex-con Jimmy Marcus (Sean Penn) is murdered, two of his childhood friends from the neighborhood are involved. Dave (Tim Robbins), a blue-collar worker, was the last person to see her alive, while Sean (Kevin Bacon), a homicide detective, is heading up the case. As Sean proceeds with his investigation, Jimmy conducts one of his own through neighborhood contacts. Eventually, Jimmy suspects Dave is the culprit and considers taking the law into his own hands.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 17m", "director": "Clint Eastwood", "studio": "MalpasoCompany,VillageRoadshowProd.", "theater_date": "Oct 15, 2003", "dvd_date": "Jan 2, 2009", "box_office": "$90.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Mystic River features a moving screenplay, solid direction and a superb cast highlighted by Sean Penn's Oscar-worthy performance.", "While Mystic River is at its basest a crime thriller, it is so much more than that.", "Clint Eastwood has infused the picture with a typically deliberate and methodical feel that certainly complements Brian Helgeland's somewhat drawn-out screenplay...", "Eastwood and his actors create a brooding drama whose events and interrelationships seem surreally improbable yet painfully authentic.", "One of its best qualities is that it's dark but not depressing.", "It is a film of magisterial, slow-burning power, one of the finest examples of recent American cinematic storytelling and certainly Eastwood's most mature film.", "Eastwood tells the story simply, barely moving the camera. The only special effect in this film is genius.", "There is nothing romantic about the law of the streets, and its unforgiving nature has a finality that can't be undone. Eastwood has an understanding of what it takes to live with yourself, not so much a sympathy as an appreciation.", "The entire cast did a phenomenal job, resisting the urge to overact too much, which is what you get for a film like this.", "Powerful performances in graphic story. Only 16+.", "Violence and revenge have been a staple of Eastwood's work from the beginning, but here he explores his subject from a new, more ambiguous angle, with no regard for macho titillation.", "American drama doesn't get any more meaty and muscular than this.", "The performances are uniformly superb.", "Good, occasionally powerful noir that's been overhyped.", "Mystic falters occasionally, but I respect its effort and I'm happy to see Mr. Eastwood growing as a director.", "While not quite the equal of the novel, it's more complex, emotionally-charged and better acted than the average Hollywood thriller.", "With characters that don't belong in the film and resolutions that seem mere fantasy, Mystic River never surpasses adequacy.", "It is in many ways Eastwood's tightest movie for some time, and certainly his darkest since Unforgiven; indeed, the ending offers as corrosive an assessment of the limits of American justice as anything in his career.", "A sprawling story that benefits from Eastwood's stripped-down approach. There are no jive talking Tarantino exchanges here, and no crowd-pleasing pyrotechnics.", "This is one of the finer dramas to come down the pike in some time."], "rating": ["", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "A", "", "3/5", "3/5", "", "A-", "5/5", "B", "3/4", "4/5", "3/4", "", "4/5", "A"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Micheal Compton", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "David Nusair", "David Germain", "Mark Steyn", "Neil Norman", "Joel Siegel", "Sean Axmaker", "Kevin Carr", "Nell Minow", "David Ansen", "Cole Smithey", "Rob Gonsalves", "Christopher Smith", "Joe Lozito", "Alan Morrison", "Wesley Lovell", "Geoff Andrew", "KJ Doughton", "Bill Clark"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Good Morning America", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seanax.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">7M Pictures", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bangor Daily News (Maine)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Big Picture Big Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Sight", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">FromTheBalcony"], "date": ["November 15, 2019", "November 13, 2019", "March 3, 2019", "November 12, 2018", "February 3, 2018", "January 11, 2018", "January 5, 2018", "April 15, 2016", "July 21, 2012", "December 26, 2010", "July 7, 2010", "June 13, 2009", "August 25, 2008", "August 5, 2007", "July 14, 2007", "December 30, 2006", "August 8, 2006", "June 24, 2006", "December 6, 2005", "June 21, 2005"]}}
