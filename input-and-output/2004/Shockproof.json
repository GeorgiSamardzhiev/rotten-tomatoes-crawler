{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Jenny Marsh (Patricia Knight) is a hard-luck dame who's just finished five years in the slammer for killing a man. Jenny's not exactly the murdering type -- she did the deed while defending her jailbird lover, Harry (John Baragrey), which is probably one reason she's attracted the attention of her parole officer, Griff Marat (Cornel Wilde).
