Cry, cry, cry.", "How James L. Brooks's Terms of Endearment evolves from a prolonged and bizarrely unfunny sit-com into a heartbreaking ten-hankie family tragedy is a phenomenon I'm not sure I can wholly explain.", "One doesn't begin to understand what exactly is Terms of Endearment: what does it represent or what is it trying to tell us? [Full Review in Spanish]", "Anyone who believes that television styles are new taking over the cinema -- or at least large sections of it -- will have their fears confirmed here.", "It is impossible to resist the feeling of watching a long-running soap opera of which you have missed rather a lot of crucial episodes.", "As tragedy moves in on Terms of Endearment during the last half hour, theatres will be awash with tears. That tragedy is a contrivance and terribly manipulative.
