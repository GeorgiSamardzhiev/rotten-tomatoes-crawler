{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In a dive south of the border, bartender Dan McGinty (Brian Donlevy) stops a young man from committing suicide after a moment of dishonesty, and relates how a moment of honesty brought him down in a flashback. As a young man, McGinty joins a crooked political boss and rises from extortionist to alderman. Urged by the boss to marry his secretary to give respectability to his run for mayor, McGinty agrees -- only to fall in love with his wife and decide to do an honest thing for once in his life.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Classics/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 22m", "director": "Preston Sturges", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 11, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["I hadn't seen in a while a political satire as simple, edgy and funny as 'The Great McGinty', the first film directed by Preston Sturges.

It's lighthearted approach to the rather heavy topic of political corruption and morality makes this a big spoonful of medicine you want to take.", "Although it doesn't compare to such later gems as The Lady Eve, The Miracle of Morgan's Creek or his best picture, Sullivan's Travels, it still offers plenty of Sturges' snappy banter.", "The Great McGinty is not a great picture, a significant picture, or an important one. It's just thumping good entertainment.", "''The Great McGinty'' was the great Preston Sturges's first showing as a director, and a happy occasion it was.", "The evolution from hoodlum to governor: 'You got to crawl before you can creep, right?'", "Sturges displays plenty of ability in accentuating both the comedy and dramatic elements of his material, withal maintaining a consistent pace in the unreeling.", "The trademark Sturges dialogue is in rare form here, each character armed with a quiver full of tart jabs and put-downs.", "It's the kind of ironical film Capra wouldn't or couldn't make.", "A wonderfully dry satire.", "", "", "Deliciously biting political satire.", "As a political comedy, it's far-fetched but certainly engaging.", "You won't make a mistake, believe us, if you stuff the ballot-box for The Great McGinty.", "Sturges' directorial debut is a little rough around the edges, but still good.", "Donlevy isn't Sturges' most appealing lead, but he'll do, and Tamiroff really works it as his patron, the Boss.", "A classic, cynical comedy about politics and corruption; still pertinent today.", "Minor Sturges.", ""], "rating": ["7/10", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "3.5/5", "A-", "", "4/5", "5/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Yasser Medina", "Raquel Stecher", "Matt Brunson", "John Kinloch", "Walter Goodman", "Fernando F.
