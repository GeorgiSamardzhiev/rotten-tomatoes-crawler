{"metadata": {"synopsis": "On a break before his last semester of medical school, Ernesto \"Che\" Guevara (Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal) travels with his friend Alberto Granado (Rodrigo de la Serna) from Brazil to Peru by motorcycle. The two men soon witness the great disparities in South America, encountering poor peasants and observing the exploitation of labor by wealthy industrialists. When they reach a leper colony in Peru, Ernesto's values have changed so much that he sides with the sufferers, forgetting his own comfort.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 6m", "director": "Walter Salles", "studio": "SouthForkPictures,FilmFourProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2015", "box_office": "$16.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Walter Salles's well-observed movie downplays politics for humanism.
