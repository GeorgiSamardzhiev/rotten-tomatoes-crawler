{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1950s England, housekeeper Vera Drake (Imelda Staunton) is a kindly wife and mother who offers selfless devotion and unwavering care to her family, which includes her husband (Philip Davis) and two grown children (Alex Kelly, Daniel Mays).

When the authorities learn of her illegal activities, Drake loses the admiration of many around her -- and possibly her freedom.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 5m", "director": "Mike Leigh", "studio": "FilmCouncil,ThinManFilms,StudioCanal", "theater_date": "Oct 10, 2004", "dvd_date": "Jun 9, 2014", "box_office": "$3.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A high-quality drama which lays bare one of the great moral conundrums of our time, provoking much thought on the issue of terminated pregnancy without declaring how you should think.", "Cleverly, Leigh has plucked a thorny issue from the past and used it to highlight inequalities that still exist.
