{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Oscar Wilde (Stephen Fry) is a married writer who has occasionally indulged his weakness for male suitors. After much toil, Wilde debuts a stage comedy in London, and a chat at the theater with Lord Alfred \"Bosie\" Douglas (Jude Law) leads to a full-on romance. Wilde ends up in a legal dispute with Lord Alfred's father, the Marquess of Queensberry (Tom Wilkinson) and, given the anti-gay local laws, is sent to jail. Wilde's vast intellect helps him survive until he regains his freedom.", "rating": "71", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Brian Gilbert", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$2.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A tony biopic that manages to combine an upfront portrayal of the scribe's gayness with an often moving examination of his broader emotions and artistic ideals.", "Stephen Fry is extraordinary as Oscar Wilde, but the movie lacks balance and finesse and comes across as a TV movie of the week.", "If anybody was born to play Oscar Wilde, it must have been Stephen Fry: not only does he look like the Green Carnation Man, but he himself is often portrayed as being too clever, too complex for his own good.", "", "", "", "", "", "Stephen Fry captures Wilde completely.", "", "[Stephen Fry] was born to play Oscar Wilde!", "", "", "", "There's never been a better story about the misadventures of one of the world's greatest writer.
