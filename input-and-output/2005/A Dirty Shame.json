{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Sylvia Stickles (Tracey Ullman) runs a convenience store with her husband (Chris Isaak) and mother-in-law (Suzanne Shepherd). One day, Sylvia is hit on the head and transforms from an uptight prude to a sex-crazed lunatic. As she goes on a rampage through town, Sylvia attracts the attention of Ray Ray (Johnny Knoxville), a sexual healer and tow truck driver in search of the world's greatest orgasm. Their sexual revolution, however, causes a class war in their tiny Baltimore community.", "rating": "53", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 29m", "director": "John Waters", "studio": "KillerFilms,ThisIsThatProductions,CityLightsPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 1, 2008", "box_office": "$1.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This exercise in bad taste is the Dawn of the Dead of nymphomania.

Sizzles when hot, fizzles when not", "A Dirty Shame is a fabulously funny exploration of fetishism, a look at the ever-more-insane ways people find to 'get off'.", "Wow. The challenges of reviewing an NC-17 movie for a family newspaper are, um, challenging.", "More a return to roots than a return to form, this messy carnal-concussion comedy celebrates the libido and every form of sexual practice", "", "A Dirty Shame is not a good movie, but it has a good message, and for that, it's well worth seeing.", "Outrageous, filthy and often hysterically funny, this is John Waters' best film since Serial Mom.", "John Waters takes on the decency brigade with a social comedy that's a refreshing return to his unhinged filmmaking style.", "The NC-17 rating and the images of Selma Blair with her gargantuan bosom seemed to promise a return to form - if Waters were going dirty again, how could he disappoint?", "A Dirty Shame is outrageous for the sake of being outrageous, but unlike some of Waters' other films, it's neither shocking nor funny.", "The filmic equivalent of a child reading aloud the Dictionary of Filth with the express intent of giving his nanny a heart attack.", "Goes through the surface motions of naughtiness, [but] it all comes off rather quaint in the end.", "It's a marked improvement over his misguided Cecil B.
