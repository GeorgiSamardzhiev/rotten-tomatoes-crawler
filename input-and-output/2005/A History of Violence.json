{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When a pair of petty criminals attempt to rob his small-town diner, Tom Stall (Viggo Mortensen) quickly and easily kills them both. In the flush of news coverage of Tom's seemingly heroic actions, a threatening stranger named Carl Fogarty (Ed Harris) comes to town, fingering the unassuming family man as long-missing Philadelphia mobster Joey Cusack. To the horror of his wife, Edie (Maria Bello), and teenage son, Jack (Ashton Holmes), Tom finds he must confront his violent past.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "David Cronenberg", "studio": "Benderspink", "theater_date": "Sep 30, 2005", "dvd_date": "Jul 24, 2014", "box_office": "$31.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The cast is excellent, especially Harris, steely-eyed and snaky, with William Hurt and Maria Bello...", "A History of Violence was my favorite film of the year...", "[An] intense, thoughtful, morally ambiguous film.", "Reveals its hand way too early, and then proceeds to deliver a second hour that left me cold.", "A fully realized, wholly rendered, singular work of art.", "This story could easily have fallen into Quentin Tarantino pop-violence territory, but Cronenberg, with tremendous skill, manages to use Hollywood clich\u00e9 to pose questions about the world in which we live.", "That's what Cronenberg is up to here; although the film has an overly facile, glossy edge to it, it's the very polish that makes you question the proceedings.", "Hopefully [it will] encourage a sobering sense of responsibility and a more truthful perspective on identities (individual and national).", "A fascinating exercise in cinematic restraint resulting in a captivating, not to be missed film.", "The less you know about this movie before seeing it -- and you really should see it -- the better.", "Cronenberg's direction, mirroring the split in Tom, is alternately measured and frighteningly explosive, and, as always, he gives the movie a nasty underlay of sexual perversity.", "This peculiarly predictable picture has been calculated, or miscalculated, to set up certain expectations, fulfill them, and then do the same thing again, thereby giving us a chance to see what's coming and, at least in theory, be shocked.", "Without conceding any of his iconoclastic vision, Cronenberg has turned a genre film with classic Western overtones into a gripping psychological drama that examines the duality of man and his infatuation with the art of violence.", "While it weakens in its final stretch...A History of Violence succeeds enormously thanks to the strength of its direction and performances.", "A truly entertaining and engrossing study of violence, family, and our pasts eventually coming back to haunt us...", "The violence that enters the characters' perfect domestic existence is permanent, and each act reveals truths about the people who use it and the audience who enjoys it.", "Impeccable formal control to match audacity is mandatory, and Cronenberg provides it", "The movie begins slowly, methodically, and builds increasingly toward a devastating climax.", "It's one of the better dramas of the year so far -- even if at times it feels like an artistic genius is painting by numbers.", "The tension builds in a slow boil, then ignites furiously when we're not quite ready for it."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "", "", "C+", "4/4", "5/5", "", "A-", "8/10", "", "", "", "A-", "3.5/4", "", "8", "", "7/10", "", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tom Meek", "Ed Travis", "Felicia Feaster", "Micheal Compton", "Matthew Lucas", "Kaleem Aftab", "Dorothy Woodend", "Jeffrey Overstreet", "Jeffrey Lyles", "Christy Lemire", "David Denby", "Joe Morgenstern", "Jeff Meyers", "Jay Antani", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Radheyan Simonpillai", "Fernando F.
