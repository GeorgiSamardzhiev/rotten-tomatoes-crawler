{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The story is an epic that is as daring and ambitious as its subject, a relentless conqueror who by the age of 32 had amassed the greatest empire the world had ever seen. Past and present collide to form the puzzle of the protagonist, a tapestry of triumphs and tragedies in which childhood memories and Alexander's rise to power unfold side by side with the later day expansion of his empire, and its ultimate downfall.", "rating": "16", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h 55m", "director": "Oliver Stone", "studio": "PacificaFilm,WarnerBrothers", "theater_date": "Nov 24, 2004", "dvd_date": "Jul 24, 2014", "box_office": "$34.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Stone has always relished posing more questions than he has answers in biopics. In Alexander, however, he enjoys it a little too much.", "The film that resulted from this obsessive desire for historical accuracy is a dud: a baggy, incoherent, bloviating mess in which any sense of the thrilling and impressive arc of Alexander's career sinks beneath the weight of period detail.", "Though Alexander is emotionally and intellectually incoherent, it's the work of a first-rate filmmaker who creates unforgettable images...could any contemporary actor fill Alexander's globe-bestriding shoes? He remains beyond Farrell's grasp.", "When you look at the bloated gleeful paranoia of JFK or the hallucinatory inflation of Natural Born Killers, who would have thought Stone would pick this subject to make a film that's so much smaller than life?", "I didn't feel particularly emotionally involved in the story. In fact half the time, I didn't even know what was going on.", "The reason it's exhausting, and ultimately boring, to sit through Alexander-and why the movie is already disappearing from theaters-is that. . .there's no dramatic arc, no shaping of the life into a good story.", "This new set presents the film in great quality and comes with some fantastic special features, but it's doubtful that this latest version of \"Alexander\" is going to change anyone's mind as to the quality of the film itself.", "For the lucky few that see this without ever having viewed the first cut, they may wonder what all the criticism was about in the first place.", "Alexander the person was great. This movie isn't.", "General mistakes all across the board contribute and reinforce each other to bring it down", "This is ultimately \"Alexander\" as written by Danielle Steele...", "Stone doesn't present characters that the audience can believe in, even for one moment, as representative of their historic roles.", "", "This oracular piece of hero-worship is perhaps the squarest film yet from this once-hip director.", "", "Stone gives us some truly stirring visuals, music that soars and charges more often than not, and, um, performances that . . . Well, um, okay, about those performances . . .", "Unwieldy and flawed, but Stone remains a tornado in an era of airless formula and -- to paraphrase our Ptolemy -- its failings are greater than most films' successes.", "Farrell, a remarkable actor on most occasions, is fatally miscast. His Alexander is a petulant crybaby, and it is hard to imagine anyone - let alone armies and nations galore - bending themselves to his will.", "Interesting but flawed film about a fascinating character.", "By summoning his inner classicist, [director] Stone has made an excruciating disaster for the ages."], "rating": ["3/5", "", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "8/10", "1/5", "", "1/4", "C-", "2/5", "1/5", "2/4", "2.5/4", "4/5", "1.5/4", "B", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Kaleem Aftab", "Daniel Mendelsohn", "David Ansen", "Mark Steyn", "Dorothy Woodend", "Daniel Mendelsohn", "Jeff Beck", "Jeff Otto", "Nell Minow", "Garth Franklin", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Cole Smithey", "Jim Lane", "Rob Gonsalves", "Joe Lozito", "Peter T.
