As the leader of the evil Psychlos, Terl and his race have taken over the world's natural resources and disregarded everyone and everything else. It's up to Jonnie \"Goodboy\" Tyler, a brave human, to battle the Psychlos and restore normalcy to the world.", "rating": "3", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Horror/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 57m", "director": "Roger Christian", "studio": "BattlefieldProductionsLLC,MorganCreekProductions,JTPFilms,FranchisePictures", "theater_date": "May 12, 2000", "dvd_date": "May 2, 2017", "box_office": "$21.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Lives up to the hype. This is the worst movie ever made.", "Nothing so entertaining, albeit in none of the right ways, should scrape WOAT status. It's not even one of the 10 worst films from 2000, a distressingly dunderheaded year for movies in general after one of the best ever.", "A disaster of a screenplay meeting dreadfully overdone and under-thought filmmaking.", "Everything is preposterous.", "The plot is like a talentless adolescent's attempt to rewrite Spartacus as science fiction.", "The plot is jumbled and poorly edited, the dialogue laughable, and special effects seldom appear so common. A performance by John Travolta in which he abandons everything that ever made him cool is the rotten cherry on top.", "If you are looking for something to hate and despise, get thee to this movie.", "Plan 9, at least, was a protest against nuclear proliferation --- what the hell is Battlefield Earth about? Is it supposed to be a tribute to man's ingenuity? If so, why is it so shoddily built?", "Appalling.", "There are many things to make fun of here.", "A monumentally silly hunk of junk.", "Logic is in short supply. Burned-out cities have electricity, for example. My favorite: A hangar full of jets, buried under 1,000 years of dust, not only fire up instantly but still have full tanks of gas.", "The end result is a science-fiction saga so incoherent, so ugly and so pointless that you have to wonder why Warner Bros, is even bothering to distribute this embarrassment.", "One can only hope for John Travolta's sake that his sci-fi epic Battlefield Earth was meant to be an uproarious comedy. If not, everyone connected with it is in deep, deep trouble.", "Not awful, but pretty bad. A third-string Planet of the Apes meets Star Trek, Battlefield Earth is a largely uninspiring sci-fi adventure with a Swiss-cheese plot.", "From any angle this is a very ill-considered project -- an obvious contender for worst film of the year.", "Overall, I liked the movie. I thought it was a good, mindless sci-fi flick with a lot of effects and action.", "It's got bad acting, atrocious dialogue and plot holes you could fly a Harrier jet through -- but the result is more exasperating than comical.", "The emphasis placed on indoctrination, enslavement and superior alien intelligence brings the film troublingly close to subliminal propaganda, while the script is so banal you'd have to be brainwashed to enjoy it.", "With this journey into the heart of rubbish, this full-throttle adventure into the hyper-space of drivel, Travolta not only incinerates what is left of his own reputation, but takes someone else down with him."], "rating": ["F", "1/5", "0.5/5", "1/5", "", "F", "1/5", "", "", "0.5/4", "", "", "", "", "", "0.5/5", "", "", "1/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Brian Gill", "Nick Rogers", "Tim Brayton", "Luke Parker", "Christopher Tookey", "Steve Persall", "Bob Grimm", "Richard von Busack", "Alexander Walker", "Matt Soergel", "Dennis King", "Jeff Strickler", "Leah Rozen", "Louis B.
