It has less obvious thrills and more depth.", "Breach rarely treads new ground, but the set pieces are used so sparingly and with such focus on the central characters, the movie reaches a degree of tension you might not think possible.", "Cooper is always dead-bang on", "A sombre game of cat-and-mouse. What it lacks in genuine tension it amply compensates in the understated performances of the two leads.", "Intriguing and intelligent, Breach may be too understated for its own good.", "An interestingly told tale: melancholy, thoughtful, and very un-American.", "Chris Cooper, who won an Oscar for his supporting role in Adaptation, gives a brilliant poker-faced performance as Hanssen and Ryan Phillippe is also convincing as O'Neill.", "Despite a couple of tense set pieces, the suspense needed to ignite this film is disappointingly lacking.", "In the face of such a towering performance from Cooper, Phillippe keeps his end up while Laura Linney, as his handler, delivers the kind of turn we've come to expect from one of America's finest movie actresses."], "rating": ["", "8/10", "4/4", "3/5", "2.5/4", "", "3/5", "4/10", "7/10", "", "3/5", "3/5", "", "B+", "3/5", "", "3/5", "3/5", "2/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Heather Huntington", "Nick Rogers", "Matthew Pejkovic", "David Nusair", "Fernando F.
