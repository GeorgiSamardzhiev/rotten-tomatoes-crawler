{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When his latest girlfriend (Julie Delpy) leaves him, retired computer magnate Don Johnston (Bill Murray) has no greater ambition than to sit around the house. When he receives an anonymous letter from a former girlfriend claiming he has a 19-year-old son he's never met, Don doesn't even think to follow up. It's not until his neighbor, a mystery fan, encourages him that Don resolves to visit the exes who seem the most likely candidates and find out the truth.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Jim Jarmusch", "studio": "BacFilms,FocusFeatures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 11, 2015", "box_office": "$13.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The film is slight, not especially malicious. Murray is entertaining to watch, even when, or perhaps especially when, he does not have a great deal to do.", "One of Jim Jarmusch's finer films.", "A movie of wry humor and wry observations.", "The film, and its very oxymoronic title, \"Broken Flowers\", acts as a metaphor for the anti-epiphanies that exploring your past can present.", "Funny, bittersweet, its understatement yielding surprising depth charges, Broken Flowers is a triumph of close observation and telling details.", "... Broken Flowers, coming from a postcode of its own, doesn't quite deliver.", "Murray shows us that what was behind his early-period jaded-hipster shtick was a melancholy and fearful man.", "Insightful, entertaining, and a worthy addition to the filmography of one of America's more interesting modern directors.", "Throbs with compressed emotion", "Murray's performance is a highlight in a very entertaining dramedy.", "Funny, disciplined, and acted with great skill and warmth.", "The ending is sublime, a set piece that almost makes up for the overwhelming slightness of it all.", "Each encounter is a finely observed and beautifully performed vignette in its own right, but together they sketch out a past from which our grey Lothario has been irrevocably set adrift.", "Womanizer cads may be front and center in movies. But surprisingly sometimes, so are the impressive accompanying ensemble righteous females who cut them nicely down to size, and the quirky and twisted Broken Flowers is no exception.", "The auteur's unbeatable weirdness here mutates into preciosity.", "After a career of deadpanning, Murray's impassive performance is still fresh, funny, sympathetic and restrained.", "This is a film about insufficiency on so many levels, a film not of hipster indifference, but of a certain effete inability to react.", "Subtle, warm direction from Jim Jarmusch and another Oscar-worthy performance from Bill Murray -- will the Academy just give him a statue, already?", "In Murray [Jarmusch] has found his quintessential actor.", "It's about questions, not easy answers, and its refusal to provide them might frustrate some viewers unaccustomed to Jarmusch's elliptical style."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "5/5", "6", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "5/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Richard Propes", "Matt Brunson", "PJ Nabarro", "David Ansen", "Victoria Segal", "Rob Gonsalves", "Gabe Leibowitz", "Fernando F.
