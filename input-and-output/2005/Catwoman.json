{"metadata": {"synopsis": "\"Catwoman\" is the story of shy, sensitive artist Patience Philips (Halle Berry), a woman who can't seem to stop apologizing for her own existence.

When Patience inadvertently happens upon a dark secret her employer is hiding, she finds herself in the middle of a corporate conspiracy.

So boring it's not even laughable.", "Halle Berry is a lovely woman with charisma to burn and definite acting ability -- but even the best actors sometimes need to be told when they're making fools of themselves.", "Not as over-the-top as you might hope, but also not as bad. Daft and moderately entertaining.", "Poor special effects (with weak echoes of better superhero outings such as Spider-Man) and an uneven central performance contribute to what was one of the flop blockbusters of 2004.", "A lumpy, unexciting mele, as satisfying as a bowl of sour milk.", "The screenplay's a hodgepodge of witchcraft, ancient Egyptian lore, pulp feminism, and a dash of S&M.", "Catwoman's director, a visual-effects specialist named Pitof, is not contained by the rules of filmmaking.

Utterly passe.", "A flashy but uninvolving Batman spin-off (of sorts) with Halle Berry starring andone-named French talent Pitof directing.", "If cats, those snootiest of creatures, went to the movies, they would be appalled and mortified. What did they ever do to deserve having their good name and mannerisms dragged through such dingbat fluff as this?", "Another hundred million dollars down the drain.", "Relentlessly gaudy and in love with its PG-13 approximation of kink, Catwoman is essentially an excuse to pose Berry in ever-skimpier outfits. It's all too pre-fab to register as sexy, though, and even the fight scenes look like fashion shoots.", "A soulless amalgamation of quick edits, computer images and swooping, nausea-inducing dolly shots.", "[Provides] a safety net for every person who ever directs a superhero movie for the rest of time: \"Well, that completely sucked, but it was no Catwoman\"."], "rating": ["F", "", "", "1/10", "2/5", "2/5", "1/5", "", "", "", "2/5", "2/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "1/10"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Brian Gill", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Andrea Thompson", "Jeffrey Lyles", "Megan Spencer", "Margaret Pomeranz", "David Stratton", "Matt Soergel", "James Vance", "Daniel Etherington", "Karen Krizanovich", "", "Andrea Gronvall", "Joe Morgenstern", "John Hazelton", "Leah Rozen", "Bruce Diones", "Keith Phipps", "Christy Lemire", "Tim Brayton"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Mad About Movies Podcast", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spool", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lyles&#39; Movie Files", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Triple J", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">At the Movies (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">At the Movies (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Florida Times-Union", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy"], "date": ["September 2, 2020", "November 7, 2019", "July 29, 2019", "January 20, 2016", "June 29, 2015", "June 29, 2015", "June 29, 2015", "June 17, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "May 3, 2014", "May 3, 2014", "May 3, 2014", "May 3, 2014", "May 2, 2014", "May 2, 2014", "May 2, 2014", "May 2, 2014", "May 2, 2014", "May 2, 2014", "July 27, 2012"]}}
