{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When small-time criminal Charley Varrick (Walter Matthau) leads a crew to rob a bank, things don't exactly go according to plan. Not only are there casualties, but also, he and his surviving cohort, Harman Sullivan (Andy Robinson), discover that they've snagged far more cash than they were expecting --and it's money that belongs to the mob. Hunted by both the police and a ruthless killer named Molly (Joe Don Baker), Charley and Harman may not live long enough to enjoy their small fortune.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Don Siegel", "studio": "Universal/UniversalInt", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 11, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The two truly indigenous forms of Hollywood film making are, of course, the western and the gangster movie. Both genres have undergone decades of refining, and Charley Varrick is one of the more accomplished specimens of the latter.", "The film, like Walter Matthau's lead performance, becomes more good-naturedly humorous as it proceeds, and marks something of a return for Siegel to the liberal softie he used to be.", "In movies like Charley Varrick, the laughter is cheap; it's accompanied only by snickers, and it leaves us degraded.", "Walter Matthau is excellent, and Joe Don Baker makes for a truly hissable villain.", "Don Siegel's excellent heist/escape movie makes an interesting juxtaposition to his Clint Eastwood films.", "Underrated Don Siegel heist drama", "", "", "The plot gets overly contrived as Charley proceeds to anticipate his pursuers and out-maneuver them... But even more wondrous is how Matthau manages to exude so much warmth in one of the most sadistically violent movies of the season.", "", "A pulp classic with a crackerjack ending.", "Sit back and enjoy the Matthau."], "rating": ["", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "3/5", "2/5", "", "4/5", "5/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["John Simon", "Tony Rayns", "Alis Loewell", "Matt Brunson", "Jeffrey M.
