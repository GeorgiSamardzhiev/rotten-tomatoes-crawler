{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Based on the beloved Roald Dahl tale, this comedic and fantastical film follows young Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) and his Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) as they join a small group of contest winners who get to tour the magical and mysterious factory of eccentric candy maker Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp). Aided by his diminutive Oompa Loompa workers (Deep Roy), Wonka has a hidden motivation for the tour, one that he will reveal only after the children in the group show their true colors.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Comedy/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Tim Burton", "studio": "VillageRoadshowPictures,WarnerBros.,ZanuckCompany,PlanBFilms", "theater_date": "Jul 15, 2005", "dvd_date": "Jan 15, 2008", "box_office": "$206.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Marrying extreme set design and sublime casting... Burton's film showcases his usual interest in gothic effects and the original Willy Wonka's psychedelia.", "A delightful treat filled with stunning visuals and a lot of fun performances, headlined by Johnny Depp.", "A movie giddily drunk on its own sheer different-ness.", "Somehow everything comes up smelling of rose-scented chocolate... Burton outdoes himself and it's the inside of the chocolate factory and its community of singing Oompa-Loompas that scintillate.", "By fleshing out the backgrounds of the factory's most peculiar characters and allowing Dahl's unique mixture of charm and menace to guide him, Burton has created a film that is sharp, scary, and, surprisingly, quite heartwarming.", "It was once a place for pure imagination. Now, under Tim Burton's care, it's a madhouse again.", "Depp, whose Wonka seems to be a cross between Michael Jackson and The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari's somnambulist Cesare, delivers an engaging surface performance, though I far prefer the more measured madness of Gene Wilder's interpretation.", "Predictably twisted scenery, a bland story, a horrible alteration of Wonka, and an ending that's anything but pleasing...", "Adults and kids alike will take macabre delight in the punishment of naughty children. Burton and co make smart and funny additions to this classic tale.", "Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is quite simply, wonderful; a brilliantly imagined story that will win old fans and new fans alike.", "The Nut Room scene, complete with squirrels, is unreservedly brilliant, a tour de force of electronic wizardry.", "One of the best family films in a while and one of the year's stronger films to date.", "Poised to become a new cult classic to replace the old one.", "The material plays to [Burton's] strengths ... he's more interesting as a stylist than a storyteller.", "Depp's Wonka exudes none of the gravity required for the role. It's as though he didn't take the role seriously. Rather than an intimidating candyman teaching brats a lesson, this Wonka is simply a freak.", "Possibly the first Hollywood movie to design a fairy tale of sorts around globalization, the film conjures a mythic Brit multinational instead of the usual imperial realm, asa basically high caloric magical kingdom.", "There's a lot of cool stuff on display here, but it lacks the consistent creative vision--or, if you like, the pure imagination--of the original film.", "full review in Greek", "If anything cramps Depp, and the film's sense of fun, it is the weight that is placed on reconciliation between Wonka and his father.", "A funny and sweet adventure for kids and parents, thanks to Burton's ability to stir the imagination and tell a sweepingly charming story."], "rating": ["", "A-", "3/4", "4/5", "", "B+", "2.5/4", "", "3/5", "4/5", "3/5", "", "5/5", "B", "2/4", "", "", "3/5", "", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Felicia Feaster", "Micheal Compton", "Matthew Lucas", "Kaleem Aftab", "Megan Basham", "Brian Orndorf", "Matt Brunson", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Film4 Staff", "Julian Roman", "Amber Wilkinson", "Garth Franklin", "Rob Gonsalves", "Jeffrey Overstreet", "Joe Lozito", "Prairie Miller", "Ethan Alter", "Joseph Proimakis", "Ryan Gilbey", "Todd Hertz"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The List", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">National Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Blu-ray.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MovieWeb", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Eye for Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dark Horizons", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Looking Closer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Big Picture Big Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Long Island Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Journal International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies for the Masses", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sight and Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christianity Today"], "date": ["February 3, 2020", "November 19, 2019", "June 5, 2019", "April 25, 2019", "February 6, 2018", "November 12, 2017", "March 4, 2015", "September 8, 2012", "May 27, 2011", "April 26, 2011", "June 13, 2008", "January 15, 2008", "September 24, 2007", "September 20, 2007", "July 14, 2007", "April 19, 2007", "March 1, 2007", "October 3, 2006", "September 28, 2006", "September 11, 2006"]}}
