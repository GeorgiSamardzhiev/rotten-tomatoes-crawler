That sense of isolation and futility easily overshadows any remnants of allegory still present.", "Unfortunately, the screenplay by Don Mancini and John Lafia is so predictable, that the jump-out-of-your-seat shocks are telegraphed far in advance.", "A steady stream of standard scares is dragged from a thinly stretched, formula slasher plot, thanks to panache beyond the call of duty from director Tom Holland.", "There is definitely some silly stuff in this movie - when you're dealing with a two foot tall killer, it's hard to take things seriously... However, the movie's ace in the hole was Chucky himself.", "The heart of the movie remains the bond between mother and child during a time of crisis, but the crisis in question is rendered with an incredible finesse...", "The sequences without Chucky are as stock as they come, and so are all the flesh-and-blood characters around him, but he's still a hugely entertaining mischief-maker, and what he lacks in physical gifts, he compensates for in sneakiness.", "Child's Play upends all conventions. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The totality of the film got inside my head and never left.", "When the doll begins not just talking - with the excellent, near-iconic voice of Brad Dourif in his mouth - but sneering, snarling and stabbing, it's an excellent reveal.", "In short, it is a title... whose plot idea was worthy of greater efforts. [Full review in Spanish]", "Chucky's back and Scream brought the mass-murdering doll back to the small screen with their Collector's Edition of CHILD'S PLAY, stuffed with all the extra features you would kill for.", "The Child's Play series kicks off with this alternatingly silly and frightening installment...", "Making a good horror-thriller, or even a good horror-comedy, is not child's play, as this schizoid film all too unfortunately proves.", "With equal portions of frolic and fear, Child's Play is a hilarious hair-raiser that is highly recommended for horror fans.", "It's no surprise that this strange, unique, demented picture spawned a whole series of follow-ups; it's just a shame their increasing gaucheness mostly deters people - including myself - from going back to where it all began.", "Never really amounts to a great horror movie."], "rating": ["8/10", "", "1/4", "", "7/10", "0.5/4", "3/5", "7/10", "8/10", "", "", "", "8/10", "", "", "3/4", "", "4/5", "3.5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Nigel Andrews", "Dave Kehr", "Kevin Thomas", "Jared Mobarak", "Roger Hurlburt", "Alan Jones", "IGN Movies Editors", "Evan Sawdey", "Scott Tobias", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Ashlee Blackwell", "Sean Collier", "\u00c1ngel Luis Inurria", "Chase Whale", "David Nusair", "Dennis Fischer", "Steve Newton", "Simon Miraudo", "Felix Vasquez Jr."], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Financial Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Jaredmobarak.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IGN Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">PopMatters", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Axis", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Box Office Prophets", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ChaseWhale.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Georgia Straight", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Quickflix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed"], "date": ["August 31, 2020", "May 14, 2020", "May 14, 2020", "May 14, 2020", "May 14, 2020", "May 14, 2020", "May 13, 2020", "May 13, 2020", "May 13, 2020", "May 13, 2020", "May 13, 2020", "February 11, 2020", "October 28, 2019", "April 4, 2018", "October 19, 2016", "February 15, 2016", "November 2, 2014", "February 14, 2014", "October 29, 2013", "October 1, 2013"]}}
