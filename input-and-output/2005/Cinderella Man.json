{"metadata": {"synopsis": "During the Great Depression, ex-boxer James J. Braddock (Russell Crowe) works as a day laborer until his former manager Joe Gould (Paul Giamatti) offers him a one-time slot against a rising young contender. After he wins a shocking upset, Braddock goes back into the ring full time, against the wishes of his frightened wife, Mae (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger). Dubbed \"The Cinderella Man\" for his rags-to-riches story, Braddock sets his sights on the defending champion, the fearsome Max Baer (Craig Bierko).", "rating": "80", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "2h 24m", "director": "Ron Howard", "studio": "ImagineEntertainment", "theater_date": "Jun 3, 2005", "dvd_date": "Nov 20, 2015", "box_office": "$61.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["As a film, Cinderella Man is terribly weak, thoroughly sentimental and predictable.", "Giamatti gives a daring, bold performance that easily could have drifted into a cartoonish character.", "In a season where adult films are at a minimum, it is a breath of fresh air.", "Even Howard and Goldsman's penchant for being over-sentimental doesn't scupper the emotional punch Braddock's story packs. That's largely down to Crowe's utterly convincing performance.", "The complexities of genuine human beings have no place in a Ron Howard production. This is film where a good woman stands behind her man, children listen to their father, and the Great Depression is described as a bit of hard times.", "It ain't no Rocky, but it ain't half bad.", "The affection for Braddock and his story can be felt in every frame and heard in every word.", "The final justification that Russell Crowe is without a doubt one of the best actors to come along in years.", "A very solid cast, one of the most reliable directors in Hollywood, and one of the most malleable subjects in film make Cinderella Man one of the best films of 2005 thus far.", "Cinderella Man plays like a movie actively hunting for awards. But it's also a pretty darn good story.", "Handsome, manipulative, simplistic. It packs an uplift that bludgeons you into submission.", "Howard's movie skillfully delivers that primal, heart-pounding satisfaction that is the promise of all boxing tales.", "As for the fights themselves, Howard brings nothing new to the canvas. Like the movie as a whole, they work fine enough, even while encased in leaden certitude.", "Cinderella Man is a contender, but it's not exactly a knockout.", "A cross between Seabiscuit (because of the Depression) and Rocky (because of the sport), yet a fine enough film to stand on its own, even if the production falls short of both in terms of its emotional punch.", "And as far as Cinderella's pumpkins go, though the movie ends with Braddock's boxing triumph in Hollywood's notorious freeze-frame approach to history, both Braddock and Baer went on to be decked by Joe Louis.", "As entertaining and uplifting a film as we'll get all year.", "At moments it almost had me, but for the most part I just felt cold and watched with all the interest of a disgruntled spectator.", "A fine alternative to the louder and more brainless summer movies competing with it -- an excellent drama that relies on heart and action instead of schmaltz and melodrama.", "Howard may have replicated the family scenes as accurately as if he'd found film from a camera hidden in the walls of the original Braddock apartment, and yet the movie can't shake the sense that the scenes away from the boxing ring are somehow false"], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "", "3/5", "", "7/10", "4/5", "4/4", "8/10", "3.5/5", "", "", "", "3/4", "3.5/4", "", "", "2.5/4", "4/4", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Richard Propes", "Micheal Compton", "Miles Fielder", "Dorothy Woodend", "Joshua Starnes", "Matthew Pejkovic", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Nick Nunziata", "David Cornelius", "Leigh Singer", "David Ansen", "Jay Ruttenberg", "Joe Lozito", "Kam Williams", "Prairie Miller", "Rex Roberts", "Garth Franklin", "Russ Breimeier", "Douglas Pratt"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The List", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Tyee (British Columbia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ComingSoon.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Matt&#39;s Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CHUD", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">DVDTalk.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Big Picture Big Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Princeton Town Topics", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Long Island Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Journal International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dark Horizons", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christianity Today", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie City News"], "date": ["February 15, 2021", "September 5, 2020", "November 18, 2019", "April 26, 2019", "August 24, 2017", "March 18, 2011", "July 6, 2010", "April 29, 2009", "February 27, 2009", "January 16, 2009", "July 31, 2008", "November 1, 2007", "August 17, 2007", "July 14, 2007", "May 7, 2007", "April 19, 2007", "February 22, 2007", "October 30, 2006", "September 22, 2006", "July 21, 2006"]}}
