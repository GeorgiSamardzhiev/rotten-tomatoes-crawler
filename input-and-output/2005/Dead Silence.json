It's actually a big pile of nonsense, but that doesn't stop it from being fun nonetheless.", "Wan and Whannell have a carnivalesque sense of fun and a sure instinct for recycling classic horror tropes, but their characters are so flat and their plotting so listless that this low-budget feature fails to generate much suspense.", "It's awful. It eats your soul, it's so awful.", "All Wan and Whannell know is shock-and-awe tactics. They may shock, but there's no awe.", "For the love of Chucky, avoid this insipid attempt at reviving the killer doll horror.", "...an ambitious misfire.", "There's something quaintly charming about the filmmakers' unabashed affection for their inspirational source material, although the sense of over-familiarity means that none of it is in the least bit scary.", "Poorly written, badly directed and ultimately scare-free horror flick that's further hindered by dismal performances and unintentionally laughable dialogue.", "It's woefully flat and not nearly as scary as it thinks it is. It almost makes one yearn for Saw. But not quite.", "I admit that I didn't see the daft last-minute twist coming, and sort of admired it, but for the rest you'd need an extravagant love of hokum not to feel mildly bored.", "Dead Silence is redeemed by a so-bad-it-is-good factor.", "It's also a bit shocking that a movie this mediocre is getting a cinema release at all.
