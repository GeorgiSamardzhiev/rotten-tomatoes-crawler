It's a movie you \"appreciate\" more than you \"enjoy.\"", "The movie takes us down an unexpected path with riveting skill and a refreshing lack of easy answers.", "The movie seems to be about drug addiction and recovery, but it gradually shifts, becoming a look from an unusual angle at what a big job it is to be a parent and the priorities it requires.", "Farmiga effectively shows the fear, need and hope at war within Irene, how the false high of being clean for a week can fade when she realizes the second week isn't going to be any easier.", "Strong performances from Vera Farmiga and Hugh Dillon keep things from becoming overdramatic.", "If there were an ounce of taste left in Hollywood, the magnificent Vera Farmiga would be a front-runner for the Best Actress Oscar.", "The film is so pitch perfect and realistic, it seems you are there with these people, watching their lives unfold before you as it happens.", "if you've ever wondered why people in 12-step programs aren't supposed to sleep together right off the bat, well, this movie is about to show you, in detail.", "A quietly harrowing chronicle of addiction and fragile recovery anchored by Vera Farmiga's intense performance.", "Vera Farmiga gives an astonishing performance in this complex chronicle of a drug addict who goes through rehab, yearning for redemption, but her experience is not tidy and there's no neat conclusion.", "This marks [Farmiga's] arrival as One to Watch.
