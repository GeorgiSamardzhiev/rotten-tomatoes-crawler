{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A young circus elephant is born with comically large ears and given the cruel nickname Dumbo. One day at a show, he is taunted by a group of kids, inciting his mother into a rage that gets her locked up. After Dumbo's ears cause an accident that injures many of the other elephants, he is made to dress like a clown and perform dangerous stunts. Everything changes when Dumbo discovers that his enormous ears actually allow him to fly, and he astounds everyone at the circus with his new talent.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Animation/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 4m", "director": "Ben Sharpsteen", "studio": "WaltDisneyProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 13, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Dumbo [is] a charming picture filled with marvelously conceived episodes. Despite this, Disney continues in it a development the problematic nature of which has grown more and more apparent since Snow-White.", "The first half of the film barely contains any dialogue, as Dumbo grows up without any need for conversation - he actually never speaks throughout the film.", "I love stories about friendship and Dumbo certainly gives us a great one.", "The imagination that went into conceptualizing each segment is astounding, with the drunken \"pink elephants\" sequence a particular highlight.", "...most interested in capturing the shadings and sounds of sadness.", "Though the character's eventual comic triumph is never in doubt, there are traumatic moments along the way, including an extraordinary, nightmarish drunk sequence that suggests the animators had early access to LSD.", "A Disney animation classic for all ages and all times.", "Dumbo was for Disney what The Old Man and the Sea was for Hemingway: a simple but powerful story that's brilliantly rendered and succeeds precisely because it is so simple, archetypal, and true.", "Another magical experience that will have the mother's crying and the kids cheering!", "Perfection, thy name is Dumbo.", "A 1941 Disney animated feature about a harassed little elephant with big ears and his friendship with an imaginative mouse.", "Disney classic will still make you cry!", "Although Dumbo offers no startling innovations in animated cartooning, it is probably Disney's best all-round picture to date.", "One of the most emotionally potent of all animated movies; I might be inclined to say, of all movies, period.", "Touching, comic, visually inventive and emotionally convincing, this remains a jewel in the crown of Disney's golden age.", "It's one of Disney's most charming and perfectly proportioned films, uninflated by the cultural pretensions Uncle Walt was fond of slipping in.", "There's a pleasant little story, plenty of pathos mixed with the large doses of humor, a number of appealing new animal characters, lots of good music, and the usual Disney skillfulness in technique.", "It just tells a great story and has beautiful moments of powerful emotion that can bring a tear to the eye even 65 years after it was made.", "Viewed in isolation, Dumbo feels like a practice feature film from animators whose only previous experience was short subjects.", "In its scant 64-minute running time, the big top melodrama of Dumbo reduces me to a blubbering, mucus-drizzling wreck at least once with every viewing."], "rating": ["", "7/10", "A", "4/4", "3/4", "", "A", "8/10", "3/5", "4/4", "3/5", "4/5", "", "1", "", "", "", "5/5", "C+", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Siegfried Kracauer", "Mike Massie", "Rachel Wagner", "Matt Brunson", "Josh Larsen", "Jake Wilson", "Dennis Schwartz", "James Plath", "Jolene Mendez", "Rob Humanick", "Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat", "Nell Minow", "", "Tim Brayton", "Jon Fortgang", "Dave Kehr", "Variety Staff", "Kevin Carr", "Steven D.
