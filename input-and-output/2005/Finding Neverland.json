{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This charming account of a period in the life of author J.M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) reveals the real relationships and events that served as the basis for the author's most iconic work, \"Peter Pan.\" After Barrie develops a platonic relationship with the widowed Sylvia (Kate Winslet) and her four sons, he is inspired to write a play about a group of children who don't want to grow up. The work proves a hit and winds up bringing Barrie and the children together in a way he had never expected.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Marc Forster", "studio": "FilmColony", "theater_date": "Nov 24, 2004", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$51.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It''s a simple lyrical film that celebrates the value of innocence in a world that seems to be fast losing out to cynicism and despair.", "Directed by Marc Forster, Finding Neverland is a pretty straightforward film that effectively balances its whimsical child-like moments with its heartfelt emotional conclusion.", "Think happy, happy thoughts and take the first star to the right, straight on til morning.", "This is a pleasing, old-fashioned tearjerker and a half. Pack a couple of hankies.", "Mingling reality and fantasy, Forster has given us a luminous, touching meditation on life and art.", "Wooden, yes, and saccharine, too. Oh, and did I mention the neutered whimsy?", "Not about Peter Pan, and not a kids' movie.", "A heartfelt, beautiful film, and one of the best dramas I've seen in years.", "Like Big Fish and The Neverending Story, this is a film that reminds us that life, coloured by our perceptions, is what we make it; all we have to do is believe.", "Johnny Depp makes another run at the Oscar in the shoes of author-playwright J.M. Barrie.", "", "Finding Neverland is about the importance of hanging on to belief in something that transcends the empirical world. It's a gentle, graceful, and unsentimental film.", "full review in Greek", "A charming and dramatic tearjerker that's sweet without resorting to syrup.", "", "Infused by an awkward decorum; the kind that descends on a gathering dominated by an unmentioned death or transgression.", "Plenty of narrative liberties have been taken.
