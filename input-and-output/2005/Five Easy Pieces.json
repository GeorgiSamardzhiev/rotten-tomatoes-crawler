{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Rejecting his cultured upper-class background as a classical pianist, Robert Dupea (Jack Nicholson) opts for a blue-collar existence, working in a California oil field and spending time with his waitress girlfriend, Rayette (Karen Black). But when Robert discovers that his father is gravely ill, he wants to reunite with his estranged family in the state of Washington. He and Rayette take a road trip that brings the two paths of his life to an uncomfortable intersection.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "Bob Rafelson", "studio": "BBSProductions,ColumbiaPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "Sep 12, 1970", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["In Easy Rider Nicholson's brilliant cameo was just too short. It left us whet- ted and fascinated like a tantalizing apertif. Now in Five Easy Pieces Nicholson is given scope.", "A courageous character study and an acting masterclass.", "Nicholson gives a galvanizing performance as a drifter who knows no tribe of his own, an updated anti-hero seething with self-loathing and discontent.", "If the function of art is to help an audience feel less alone, then Five Easy Pieces succeeds beautifully.", "A very modern film. Elliptical, absurdist, harshly humorous, convulsively lyrical.", "Gritty '70s drama about alienation has sex, cursing.", "A new kind of picture even for its era ... Jack Nicholson's performance still stands as one of his greatest.", "Director Bob Rafelson attempts something unusual here, making a film that's subtle about its meaning without ever ranging into the pretentiously oblique or merely ambiguous.", "The flaws of this acutely self-conscious 1970 road picture grow more obvious with every passing year, but so does its passion and eloquence.", "The movie has more anger than it knows what to do with; that's its fascination and its weakness, too.", "This superbly composed film comes as close to perfection as it gets.", "A key turn-of-the-decade film, with Nicholson railing against waitresses and barking at noisy dogs as Rafelson observes seedily picturesque roadside America.", "The film, superbly directed by Rafelson, shifts the late 1960s hippy drop-out genre into the Ingmar Bergman class: it's cerebral, yes, but also moving and witty.", "The movie is a succession of dazzling scenes.", "The landscape photography of Lszl Kovcs is a minor marvel, while the sound design is an intelligent complement to the sonorities evoked in the film's title.", "The feature is anchored by Nicholson's performance, in which he demonstrates his unique ability to swiftly shape-shift from a cheeky sweet-heart into a volatile beast.", "Nicholson makes it all go. He proves he is more than a \"character actor\" with many scenes, especially the confrontation with his father.", "The movie is best known for a classic tell-off in a diner, but watch Nicholson's eyes as he says it. The man is damaged and needs help", "An American entry into the French New Wave starring a compelling Jack Nicholson.", "Boasting a career best performance by Jack Nicholson in the lead role, Rafelson's movie is a penetrating study of American alienation."], "rating": ["", "", "", "4/4", "", "3/5", "3.5/4", "5/5", "", "", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "", "3/5", "4/5", "4/4", "5/5", "4/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Harvey G.
