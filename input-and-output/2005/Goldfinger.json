It does have some flaws in the third quarter of the film, but it pulls it back to become a fun, relaxing watch.", "The ultimate measure of Goldfinger's sustained success is in how much it's become part of our shared filmic culture irrespective of whether folks have even seen the movie.", "Goldfinger allows nothing to impede its sense of humour: it converts Bond into a human equivalent of the cat in the Tom and Jerry cartoons, with the same ghastly resilience and the same capacity for absorbing punishment.", "This is the third, tightest and wildest script Sean Connery, as the invincible agent, has yet had on the screen.", "It's phenomenal!", "Goldfinger really is a dazzling object lesson in the principle that nothing succeeds like excess.", "[VIDEO ESSAY] \"Goldfinger\" set in stone the formula for what would become cinema's longest running and most reliably entertaining franchise. Regardless of how many installments have come since, \"Goldfinger\" retains its reputation as the best of the bunch.", "All the tropes are genre highs, from the iconic title song to the archetypal cool car to the endlessly quotable sadistic one-liners.", "Ours not to reason why with \"Goldfinger\"; ours but to gape and admire; which is very easy and enjoyable until the story's iceberg of extravagance finally appears in its true proportions.", "For 007 fans or action adventure/spy movie fans in general, it really doesn't get much better than \"Goldfinger,\" a tremendous blockbuster that entertains on every level.", "GOLDFINGER, for me, isn't the perfect Bond movie (though it does have all the elements to be perfect), but it's still a fun, corny time. Definition of a popcorn movie.", "Gone is any and all idea of James Bond's vulnerability. However, \"Goldfinger\" swaps in a gaudier, glitzier subtext directly related to how this blockbuster took aim almost squarely at an American audience.", "There's a very special, and weird, purity about the Bond formula as it is presented here: all the excess is in place but still reined in by some last measure of discipline."], "rating": ["5/5", "7/10", "4.5/5", "", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "", "4/4", "", "A+", "5/5", "", "9.5/10", "3/4", "4/5", "9/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Danielle Solzman", "Mike Massie", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Jake Tropila", "Tom Meek", "Merl Edelman", "PJ Nabarro", "David Hogan", "Zaki Hasan", "Penelope Houston", "W.
