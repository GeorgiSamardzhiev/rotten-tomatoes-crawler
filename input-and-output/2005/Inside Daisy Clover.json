{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Teen tomboy Daisy Clover (Natalie Wood) dreams of fame -- and gets her wish when big-time movie producer Raymond Swan (Christopher Plummer) comes calling. But, as her image is remolded for the media and her family life is thrown into turmoil, Daisy discovers that being a star in 1930s Hollywood isn't what it's cracked up to be. Alone and distrustful, the young actress searches for a happy ending with a fellow rising star, Wade Lewis (Robert Redford).", "rating": "33", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h 8m", "director": "Robert Mulligan", "studio": "WarnerBros.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 8, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Inside Daisy Clover isn't a perfect film by any means but it offers an inside look at Hollywood life in the 1930s.", "Inside Daisy Clover isn't exactly a camp outing, but it's also impossible to take seriously.", "Only Christopher Plummer and Katherine Bard... seem to know what the point of the picture is. If the director, Robert Mulligan, ever knew, it slipped his mind while he was photographing the beach in sun-washed blues, like a set for Carousel.", "Hollywood self-satire is also a corridor of mirrors where movie makers are apt to start cringing.", "Too much, too soon, for Daisy and for us.", "Wood's movements are spasmodic and graceless. The director Robert Mulligan can't quite find the rhythm, either. Some of the picture is whimsical, some of it as lugubrious as a horror movie.", "Entertaining showbiz tale despite being short on execution.", "Grim but sometimes well-directed tale of insidious studio types in Old Hollywood.", "Director Mulligan can't find the right tone for Gavin Lambert's inside Hollywood tale about a girl rise to stardom before collapsing and so the story veers from a cautionary fable to Gothic melodrama to farce, but some of the acting is good.", "Covering a two-year period, the outcome is at times disjointed and episodic as the title character played by Natalie Wood emerges more nebulous than definitive.", "", "Gavin Lambert's screenplay (from his own novel) lives in the land of the ambiguous and fey, which is probably why the film now seems subtle and attractive.", "There have been better pictures about Hollywood, but few as triumphantly, all-round bad as Inside Daisy Clover.", "Wood has one great breakdown scene, reminiscent of Judy Garland (an inspiration for the character) but she lacks the star's range and depth of emotion, and the songs don't hold a candle to Arlen and Co.", "The talented director Robert Mulligan, apparently engulfed by studio overproduction, falters at times, not always knowing whether to play things straight or for laughs."], "rating": ["3.5/5", "2/4", "", "", "2/5", "", "B-", "", "C+", "", "3/5", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Danielle Solzman", "Matt Brunson", "Joan Didion", "TIME Staff", "TV Guide Staff", "David Denby", "Dennis Schwartz", "Michael E.
