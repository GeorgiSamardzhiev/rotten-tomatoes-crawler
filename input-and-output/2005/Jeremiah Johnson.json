{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A Mexican-American War veteran, Jeremiah Johnson (Robert Redford), heads to the mountains to live in isolation. Woefully unequipped for the task at hand, Johnson is fortunate to come across a seasoned mountain man (Will Geer) willing to teach him the necessary survival tactics. As life continues in the mountains, Johnson finds himself a native bride (Delle Bolton) and an adopted son (Josh Albee). However, their peaceful existence is threatened when Johnson incurs the ire of the Crow Indians.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Western", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Sydney Pollack", "studio": "WarnerBros.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 12, 2013", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Anyone who likes looking at Robert Redford or mountain landscapes or both will be very happy.", "The dialogue is spare, the scenery the real star. Satisfying and impressive.", "Episodic in structure, the film is kept constantly interesting by its director who fills the screen with colourful little anecdotes", "A gritty, cinematic tall tale that resonates across geography, time, and the loneliest regions of the solitary heart.", "Lacking in both action and dialogue, certainly, but look at that view.", "Shortcomings and all, a fascinating attempt to capture the soul of the Western and splash it out for all the world to see.", "Pollack's attempts at myth-making yield the same results as his attempts at most anything else. Jeremiah Johnson is boring, overlong, and pointless.", "Beautifully photographed in the remote mountains of Utah.", "Beautifully photographed in the wilds of Utah, this film unfortunately doesn't know when to stop; it feels consumed by a self-concious desire to be arty, and offers a treatment too cool for its subject matter.", "Director Sydney Pollack has given a skilled, observant mounting as he carefully allows the man to grow in experience and knowhow.", "Pollack does right to put his faith in one man and a whole lot of mountains. The result is impressive.", "", "Like other films of the 1970s, Pollack's saga combines nostalgia and cynicism in equal measure, thus pleasing both right-wing and left-wing viewers, not to speak the delight of seeing Robert Redford at his most handsome in a cowboy attire.", "A flawed but immensely appealing film.", "There are momoments of great beauty and terror and deeply earned pathos. There are as well such not-so-incidental pleasures as John Rubinstein's lovely and serviceable musical score, and a cast of excellent supporting actors.", "Gritty, gorgeously photographed mountain man tale.", "", "", "Pollack and Redford collaborated successfully, their earnestness yielding some handsome, if over indulgent, movies such as this factually based adventure.", "A very entertaining film that doesn't flinch about how tough life was for the early settlers."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "3/5", "8/10", "1/4", "A-", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "3/5", "B", "", "3.5/5", "4/5", "3/5", "4/5", "", "3.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Christopher Hudson", "Don Druker", "", "Marcel Meyer", "Andrew Collins", "Tim Brayton", "Walter Chaw", "Dennis Schwartz", "", "Variety Staff", "William Thomas", "John A.
