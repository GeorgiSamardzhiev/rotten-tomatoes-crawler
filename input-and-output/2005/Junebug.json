[Full Review in Spanish]", "An observant, literate slice of Southern life.", "It could have been an exercise in \"let's mock the provincials...\" But the writer and the director (Angus McLachlan, Phil Morrison) are both from North Carolina, so each side in this meeting of opposites is both humanised and demonised.", "You can call Junebug an unwanted, but much needed homecoming, mostly celebrated by the hearty welcome of George's sister-in-law Ashley Johnsten, played by Amy Adams.", "Morrison and MacLachlan mine the clash of cultures for comedy, but there's an undertow of sadness to their film - and Adams's touching performance as George's na\u00efve but well-meaning, heavily pregnant sister-in-law captures this perfectly", "At every moment when \"Junebug\" could choose dramatic clich, even with Ashley's pregnancy, it's beautifully subtle. A poetic, graceful tale about the comforts and oddities of returning home to family.", "The humor here is expectedly quirky but it feels earned thanks to writer MacLachlan and director Morrison's honestly rendered observations of family and small-town life", "Junebug annoyed me while in the theater, and annoys me even more as I write about it.", "Amy Adams is simply magical, guileless and throbbing, sunniness fraught with desperation", "A wonderful bittersweet dramedy that deserves to be seen.", "...one of many reasons to love Junebug is how often it offers us spaces to fill in ourselves, the faith it shows in handing us small puzzles -- Eugene's hand-carved bird, for instance -- to chuckle over or think on afterward.", "From dinner-table silences, to nuances of Baptist vocabulary, to 'colorful' displays of Southern imagination, these people are three-dimensional and compelling.", "To get a good idea of what to expect, think Hee Haw presented as a Shakespearean melodrama.", "Not since...My Cousin Vinny has there been a more charming class-clash comedy-drama than Junebug.", "[Adams is] a knockout and makes the film, despite its shortcomings, deeply pleasurable.", "click to read review [Greek]", "An arthouse Meet The Parents, Junebug explores the same territory with greater subtlety and complexity, and more chuckles and quiet smiles, instead of big comedy routines.", "", "Um filme que exige ser visto mais de uma vez, no mnimo para que possamos ter o prazer de rever atuaes to ricas em detalhes.", "Delicately avoids Hollywood's typical condescending caricatures of those who dwell below the Mason-Dixon line."], "rating": ["", "2.5/4", "", "B+", "", "3.5/4", "3/4", "2", "", "", "", "A", "1/4", "", "4/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "5/5", "B+"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Alberto Abu\u00edn", "Matthew Lucas", "Nigel Andrews", "Candice Frederick", "Jason Best", "Nick Rogers", "Jay Antani", "Gabe Leibowitz", "Fernando F.
