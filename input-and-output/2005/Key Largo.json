{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This classic film noir by John Huston stars Humphrey Bogart as World War II vet Frank McCloud. Visiting Key Largo to pay his respects to the family of his late war buddy, McCloud attempts to comfort his comrade's widow, Nora (Lauren Bacall), and father, James Temple (Lionel Barrymore), who operate a hotel. But McCloud realizes that mobsters, led by the infamous Johnny Rocco (Edward G. Robinson), are staying in the hotel. When the criminals take over the establishment, conflict is inevitable.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "John Huston", "studio": "WarnerBrothers", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 3, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The real stars of the film are mind games and manipulation, sharply brought to life by the restrained verbal feuding between Bogart and Robinson.", "Key Largo (1948) is one of the more entertaining crime-gangster melodramas from Warner Bros. The intelligent, exciting, theatrical, but moody, downbeat crime drama-thriller (and melodramatic film noir)...", "...there's an inherent theatricality in the situation of strangers involuntarily sharing a small space...", "It's pure irony that perhaps the objective best Bogart and Bacall film has their least satisfying onscreen relationship.", "This is surprisingly staid for a Huston film. Still, the top-notch cast punches it across, and the swirling storm raging outside the hotel provides an interesting backdrop.", "A classy little '40s chamber piece that is competently handled by writer-director John Huston and supremely well acted by its starry cast.", "First seen soaking in a tub while chomping on a cigar, Robinson arises from the water to put a stranglehold on the film.", "Trapped in a country estate by an impending storm, a mobster attempts to lay low before escaping from the police, but takes a risky gambit holding Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall hostage.", "Claire Trevor won a Supporting Oscar for playing the alcoholic mistress of Edward G. Robinson's gangster in John Huston's taut crimer starring Bogart.", "Edward G. Robinson steals the movie with his permanent grimace, heavy walk and intimidating presence.", "A little windy and rhetorical for my taste, but still one of John Huston's best efforts.", "Perfeclty tense atmosphere and performances, with the sparks flying between Bogart and Bacall.", "Huston's wayward talent seldom lacked energy.", "Edward G. Robinson deserves special praise.", "Emphasis is on tension in the telling, and effective use of melodramatic mood has been used to point up the suspense.", "", "Great cast headed by Bogart in Huston classic.", "Like the similarly sweaty, claustrophobic 12 Angry Men, Key Largo is a rare adaptation of a stage play in which the physical constraints of the stagebound source material are a strength rather than a weakness.", "Although the characters are basically stereotypes, they are lent the gift of life by a superlative cast.", "The script prepared by Mr. Huston and Richard Brooks was too full of words and highly cross-purposed implications to give the action full chance."], "rating": ["9/10", "A+", "8/10", "8/10", "3/4", "3/5", "3/4", "3.5/4", "B+", "4/5", "", "4/5", "", "4/4", "", "4/5", "5/5", "A-", "", "2.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Tim Dirks", "Sarah Boslaugh", "Nathanael Hood", "Matt Brunson", "PJ Nabarro", "Josh Larsen", "Wesley Lovell", "Emanuel Levy", "Matthew Pejkovic", "Dave Kehr", "Ian Nathan", "", "", "Variety Staff", "Cole Smithey", "Steve Crum", "Steven D.
