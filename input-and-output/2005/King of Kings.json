{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this reenactment of the life of Jesus Christ, when word spreads throughout Judea that the son of God is to be born in Bethlehem, King Herod demands that all infants be killed. Mary (Siobhan McKenna) steals away with her young son, Jesus, who grows up preaching, performing miracles and acquiring devotees. One of Jesus' (Jeffrey Hunter) followers, Judas (Rip Torn), betrays him, and he is sentenced to crucifixion. But Jesus has always known of his fate and has prepared himself for death.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Faith & Spirituality", "runtime": "2h 40m", "director": "Nicholas Ray", "studio": "SamuelBronston", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 1, 2008", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Because the makers of this film took a chance by casting heartthrob Jeffrey Hunter as Christ, this was labeled I Was a Teenage Jesus (a play, of course, on the era's I Was a Teenage Werewolf).

On Blu-ray it makes a splendid showing.", "Director Nicholas Ray makes few positive contributions.", "Jeffrey Hunter is less Saviour of the Christian faith and more anti-hero with many very human doubts and concerns.", "An epic of considerable scope, filled with broad vistas, yet there are enough intimate moments to give audience a chance to engage with the characters rather than just admire their pontificating.", "Director Nicholas Ray has brooded long and wisely upon the meaning of his meanings, has planted plenty of symbols along the path, yet avoided the banalities of religious calendar art.", "This is one of the most interesting screen versions of the Gospels.", "", "", "Let us say the spirit is hinted but the projection of it is weak.", "", "A sweeping and at times stirring biblical epic.", "Perfect for Easter TV.", "", "As such, it's a pretty reverent recounting of the New Testament.", "This quirky 'Scope biblical spectacular is a lot more thoughtful and interesting than most."], "rating": ["3/4", "3/5", "7/10", "B+", "", "7/10", "", "3/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "3/5", "3/5", "2/5", "2/5", "B", "3/5", "3/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Matt Brunson", "Kevin Carr", "Tim Brayton", "Emanuel Levy", "Sean Axmaker", "John J.
