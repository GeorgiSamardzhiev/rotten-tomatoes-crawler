Lawrence (Peter O'Toole) is sent to Arabia to find Prince Faisal (Alec Guinness) and serve as a liaison between the Arabs and the British in their fight against the Turks.

And I wish it have never been made.", "In a recent viewing of Lawrence of Arabia at a local independent moviehouse, I found myself more in awe than ever.", "Regardless of the historical inaccuracies and contestable portrayals, the film is a flourishing masterpiece of storytelling prowess.", "Allowances for changing tastes and styles must be made for many a film from decades past; that is not the case with Lawrence, which remains as invigorating as the night it was first shown.", "Lawrence, as portrayed by Peter O'Toole with a career-making and career-defining performance, is one of cinema's most fascinatingly complex characters.", "Seldom if ever in motion-picture history has a long-delayed, big-budget \"epic\" so fully measured up to expectations.", "No special effects are front and center here, simply the way a master creator of images pulls us into a dramatic story of great psychological complexity.", "David Lean and his cinematographer, Fred A. Young, have given us something really spectacular to look at; the desert, in all its austerity and grandeur, is the star.", "It drew me in and earns it's 3.5 hour running time.", "The definitive David Lean movie.", "Robert Bolt's intelligent screenplay captures a portrait of a fiendishly complex, hopelessly idealistic individual and explores the politics at play.", "It combines an astute character study with some of the most jaw-dropping images captured on film.", "The second half isn't quite as compelling as the first, but to paraphrase a comment I once heard regarding another film: The first half is pure perfection, and then it devolves into one of the best movies ever made.", "Lean and photographer Fred A. Young have combined their artistic talents in an evocation of the Arabian desert that makes it both terrifying and deeply moving in its lonely grandeur.", "It has an epic hero whom it doesn't hero-worship...[O'Toole] brings flawlessly to life the film's vision of a flawed warrior who is corrupted by pride, soured by empty victories and betrayed finally by the jubilant jump of his heart every time he kills.", "[VIDEO ESSAY] Celebrated British director David Lean's \"Lawrence of Arabia\" is a textbook example of \"epic\" cinema.", "This is movie-making on the grandest scale.", "Despite the film's technical wizardry, the seven Academy Awards and the expansive budget, this time-honored epic is ultimately a testament to something elemental: the ability to make an audience gasp as a story is told.", "If epics are your thing, they don't come much grander.", "Of all miracles readily apparent on screen, perhaps the greatest is that the film even got made in the first place."], "rating": ["", "4.0/4", "1", "", "5/5", "", "", "", "A+", "4/4", "5/5", "5/5", "4/4", "4/4", "", "A", "5/5", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Pauline Kael", "Richard Propes", "Mike Massie", "Kyle Smith", "Matt Neal", "Clyde Gilmour", "Kenneth Turan", "Dwight MacDonald", "Rachel Wagner", "Josh Larsen", "Allan Hunter", "Neil Smith", "Matt Brunson", "Kate Cameron", "Alexander Walker", "Cole Smithey", "Adrian Turner", "People Staff", "Philip Kemp", "Matthew Thrift"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KPFA (Berkeley, CA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">National Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ABC Radio (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Maclean&#39;s Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Esquire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Express (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Little White Lies"], "date": ["November 17, 2020", "September 13, 2020", "August 27, 2020", "July 23, 2020", "May 18, 2020", "November 26, 2019", "August 29, 2019", "August 9, 2019", "April 4, 2019", "September 18, 2018", "September 24, 2017", "September 21, 2017", "July 9, 2017", "February 16, 2016", "February 16, 2016", "August 12, 2015", "February 26, 2014", "February 26, 2014", "February 26, 2014", "February 26, 2014"]}}
