Dick, Minority Report has aged rather well with its prescient, paranoiac glimpse of the not-distant-enough future.", "It's a handsome film-certainly better than A.I.-but ultimately rather tedious and falsely sentimental, as Spielberg films have a tendency to be.", "Deviation from the original Dick story leaves huge gaps in the plot which require implausible explanations in order to close out the film.", "Spielberg creates an intriguing world that is at once futuristic and accessible, it makes our collective imagination soar but is never alienating.", "By turning Dick's ironic little story into a gargantuan thriller celebrating free choice, Spielberg has been true to his character: He's transformed something dark and scary into something softer and more comfortable.", "If less poetic than AI, Minority Report is much more confidently directed, with a firmer sense of its maker's own urge to entertain and stimulate rather than bemuse.", "Even if he belabors the ending and can't resist tempering the darkness with a strained ray of hopefulness, Minority Report is a document that proves Spielberg among the top ranks in a minority of film geniuses.", "The worst thing about the new Steven Spielberg picture is the title, Minority Report. The best thing about it is pretty much everything else.", "This is a grown-up movie by men who've suddenly realised that their inner Peter Pans have deserted them.", "Too much of Minority Report is facile, albeit at a very high level.", "Though his movie wraps challenging ideas and ingenious visual conceits in a futurist film-noir style, it's pretentious, didactic and intentionally but mercilessly bleak.", "This masterfully sleek vision of the future from director Steven Spielberg is an awesome mix of skewed science fiction, twisty Hitchcock-style thrills, stunning blue-grey tinged photography and outstanding design.", "[Minority Report] takes themes from Blade Runner, Total Recall and especially the little seen Gary Fleder-directed Impostor and stirs them up into an absorbing thriller.", "High-concept science-fiction escapades often try to impose new ways of seeing, but Spielberg seems intent on blistering our optic nerves.", "For its stunning visuals and standout performances, Minority Report -- or at least the first three-fourths of it -- might just be the best movie so far this year.", "The movie's combination of old and new influences energizes its believable futuristic elements.", "Not simply Steven Spielberg's most prescient sci-fi work but also one of his finest.", "Violent sci-fi detective movie isn't for kids."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "8/10", "4/5", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "2.5/4", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "A-", "B+", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Danielle Solzman", "Mike Massie", "Christopher Lloyd", "Kathi Maio", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Namrata Joshi", "John Powers", "Alexander Walker", "Dennis King", "Anthony Lane", "", "Michael Sragow", "Joe Morgenstern", "Alan Jones", "Mike Goodridge", "Peter Rainer", "Christy Lemire", "Cole Smithey", "Nick Schager", "Nell Minow"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Solzy at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Yap", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Outlook", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">L.A.
