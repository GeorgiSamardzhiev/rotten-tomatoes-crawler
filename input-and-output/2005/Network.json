{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this lauded satire, veteran news anchorman Howard Beale (Peter Finch) discovers that he's being put out to pasture, and he's none too happy about it. After threatening to shoot himself on live television, instead he launches into an angry televised rant, which turns out to be a huge ratings boost for the UBS network. This stunt allows ambitious producer Diana Christensen (Faye Dunaway) to develop even more outrageous programming, a concept that she takes to unsettling extremes.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 1m", "director": "Sidney Lumet", "studio": "UnitedArtists,MetroGoldwynMayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2008", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Boasts an extremely intelligent script that is, in alternation, deliciously sardonic and depressingly sobering, with rapid-fire dialogue that congests every cynical exchange.", "It's scary just how prophetic Network has become.", "Chayefsky was more wrong than right; Television policed itself better than he envisioned because he didn't understand who really calls the shots when it comes to programming.", "Excellent portrayals by Faye Dunaway, William Holden, Peter Finch, and Robert Duvall make each performer worthy of an Academy Award nomination and makes Network a biting treat.", "Network is a staggering and jolting attack upon the networks and corporate structure.", "A corrosive and poetic story about the world of American television. [Full Review in Spanish]", "[Network] regularly finds itself at the pinnacle of \"Best Movie\" ratings. In a world where ratings are everything, that's a mighty fine accomplishment.", "With a powerful performance from Peter Finch, the satirical Network is relevant more so today than upon the theatrical release back in 1976.", "It deserves to be credited for [its] accuracy... and overall it's still great fun to watch.", "Paddy Chayefsky's 1976 satire about network television, directed by Sidney Lumet, was amazing then, and it's amazing now...", "It was the height of satire in 1976: dark as hell, but patently absurd and surely nowhere close to objective reality. Objective reality surpassed it somewhere in the Jerry Springer era.", "No performance is less than brilliant, with Dunaway particularly effective in the film's showiest role. Holden, Finch and Duvall, as always, contribute bed-rock-solid performances.", "This tale of a failing network that feeds on the mental breakdown of one of its anchors, cannibalising itself for ratings, feels as savagely relevant now as it did when it was released nearly 40 years ago.", "Network is neither fair nor modest. It's full of bile, travesty, scolding -- and wry humour.", "Criticised by some at the time for a certain naivety and lack of subtlety, this remains one of the most devastating condemnations of the media's urge to exploit.", "Rousing, exciting satire, if not always the most perfectly focused and sophisticated.", "Network taps into the hysteria of the television business at a time when the medium was still important, a monolithic and competitive media industry hungry to tap into the next big thing and do anything for ratings.", "The mystic quality within \"Network\" is that it pitches curve balls at us that have meanings relative to our unique situations, and all of them encompass a value that is beyond simple comprehension.", "A brilliantly played, stone-cold '70s classic, whose message -- the blur between entertainment and degradation -- has more than a tang of topicality in these days of reality TV-dominated scheduling.", "There is plenty wrong with television, plenty to satirize. But Network prudently misses the point, dishing up an outrageous razzle-dazzle stew that will ruffle no network feathers and delight a popular audience."], "rating": ["9/10", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "3.5/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "4/5", "8/10", "A+", "4/4", "5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Allen Almachar", "Kyle Smith", "David A.
