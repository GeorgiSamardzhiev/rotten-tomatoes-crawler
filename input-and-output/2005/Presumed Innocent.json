{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Prosecuting attorney Raymond Horgan (Brian Dennehy) assigns his chief deputy, the taciturn Rusty Sabitch (Harrison Ford), to investigate the rape and murder of colleague Carolyn Polhemus (Greta Scacchi), unaware of their torrid affair.

Who can be trusted? Who is innocent? Who is guilty?", "Pakula's strong suit has always been his work with actors, and he's got a lot of good ones at his disposal. Ford gives a smart, self-effacing performance.", "The film's densely constructed trial sequences are freighted with rich detail, unexpected turns and intimate insights into the criminal justice system.", "It presents a more intriguing and certainly more complicated portrait of cinema's historic struggle with representations of female agency and sexuality.", "This could have been a great movie, but, despite being a darn good yarn well told, the essential magic is somehow missing.", "A thudding disappointment.", "Conscientiously as this movie has been made, it does not work as well as the novel did or as some of Pakula's other films have.", "Never less than engrossing.", "Pakula and the cast are excellent in the cut and thrust debates and the grilling of witnesses. At least on the surface, Presumed Innocent unfolds in the grand tradition of great courtroom drama. But nothing in Presumed Innocent is what it seems.", "When you get right down to it, Presumed Innocent is really just an elaborate version of the standard courtroom drama -- souped-up Perry Mason. On the other hand, this is as good as Perry Mason gets.", "Presumed Innocent is a stylish, dark-toned movie with handsome photography (by Gordon Willis) and solid performances.", "Pakula keeps the suspense level high throughout and effectively brings off a series of twists at the end.", "A ponderous adaptation of Scott Turow's cunningly plotted mystery novel.", "Intelligent, complex and enthralling.", "The performances are capable, if rarely inspired.", "Based on the bestseller by Scott Turow, this intellectual whodunit begins on a slowburn as the investigation gets under way, before being resolved in a cracking courtroom drama.", "A well-rigged whodunit."], "rating": ["", "2.5/4", "", "", "", "4/4", "", "4/5", "", "", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "5/5", "", "", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["John Pym", "David Nusair", "Hilary Mantel", "Dolores Barclay", "David Ansen", "Dennis King", "Ted Pigeon", "Sue Heal", "Candice Russell", "Richard Schickel", "", "Desmond Ryan", "Gary Thompson", "Jay Boyar", "Ralph Novak", "Terrence Rafferty", "Sheila Benson", "David Sterritt", "", "Ian Nathan"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sight and Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slant Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine"], "date": ["January 11, 2020", "August 17, 2019", "April 9, 2019", "June 12, 2018", "February 6, 2018", "July 27, 2016", "July 30, 2015", "July 31, 2013", "July 31, 2013", "July 31, 2013", "July 31, 2013", "July 31, 2013", "July 31, 2013", "July 31, 2013", "July 31, 2013", "July 31, 2013", "July 31, 2013", "July 31, 2013", "July 31, 2013", "July 31, 2013"]}}
