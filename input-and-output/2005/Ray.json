{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Legendary soul musician Ray Charles is portrayed by Jamie Foxx in this Oscar-winning biopic. Young Ray watches his 7-year-old brother drown at age seven. When he loses his sight at the age of 9, his hardworking mother (Sharon Warren) urges him not to feel sorry for himself. He rises through the ranks of the Seattle jazz scene, struggling with drug addiction and infidelity while on the road. Supported by his wife (Kerry Washington), Ray Charles redefines soul music and inspires a generation.", "rating": "80", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 33m", "director": "Taylor Hackford", "studio": "CrusaderEntertainmentLLC,UnchainMyHeartLouisiana", "theater_date": "Oct 29, 2004", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$75.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The soul-stirring sounds of music legend Ray Charles keep saving the day for this straightforward, safe-bet biopic.", "It's hard to think of a more artless film depicting such a talented artist.", "RAY suffers from having not enough story to warrant a feature film and too much talent wasted on caricatures of historical figures. RAY, like last year's BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY, is too focused on homage rather than telling a convincing and stirring story.", "Jamie Foxx as Charles proves again that he may just be one of the most interesting actors of his generation. A subtle mix of impression, pathos and rare presence, Foxx holds your focus even when the film begins to prevaricate.", "A powerhouse performance piece for Jamie Foxx and a rock solid biopic.", "Excellent portrayal of extraordinary musician.", "Jamie Foxx is excellent, and sturdily supported by [James L.] White's script all the way.", "I wanted excellent, but it's only mediocre.", "", "Ray is filled with such pleasures, but it's hobbled by the too-familiar conventions of the musical biopic: with so many chapters of Charles's life to cover, Hackford's movie never finds a rhythm, a groove, to settle into.", "", "Give Jamie Foxx the damn Oscar already, it's done.", "Potent and vibrant as far as the music goes, but reticent, self-conscious and pretty much stuck on unexplored surfaces when it comes to this creative giant's complex life and times.", "The directing is sure-handed, the script intelligent, and the acting strong, especially the amazing performance from Foxx.", "click to read full review [Greek]", "", "", "It's a bravura performance, but we never feel that we really know who Ray Charles was, or even that Foxx does.", "", ""], "rating": ["3/5", "2/5", "6/10", "4/5", "8/10", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "5/5", "", "3.5/4", "A", "", "3.5/4", "5/5", "4/5", "3/5", "", "2/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Leigh Paatsch", "PJ Nabarro", "Alex Maidy", "Paul Dale", "R.L.
