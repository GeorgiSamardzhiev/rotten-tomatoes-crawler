{"metadata": {"synopsis": "High-school principal Dr. Alfred Carroll (Josef Forte) relates to an audience of parents that marijuana can have devastating effects on teens. In his story, a drug supplier entices several restless teens, including sister and brother Mary (Dorothy Short) and Jimmy Lane (Warren McCollum) and Mary's boyfriend, Bill (Kenneth Craig), into frequenting a \"reefer\" house. Gradually, Bill and Jimmy are drawn into smoking dope, which affects their family lives and leads to a terrible crime.", "rating": "39", "genre": "Classics/Cult Movies/Drama", "runtime": "1h 7m", "director": "Louis Gasnier", "studio": "GeorgeA.HirlimanProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 1, 2009", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Before it became an ironic cult hit in the 1970s, Reefer Madness was a well-intentioned and unintentionally hilarious cautionary tale entitled Tell Your Children...", "Strictly an amateur-hour production, filled with laughably over-the-top acting and a silly sense of self-righteousness that make it the perfect exploitation camp classic.", "This gloriously awful film is highly recommended to lovers of stunningly bad movies.", "Perhaps the mother of all bad movies, however, the didactic film, unlike later stinkers, takes itself extremely seriously, seeing itself as an important instrument in the campaign against drugs.
