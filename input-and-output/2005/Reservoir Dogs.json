[Full Review in Spanish]", "Tarantino's jumbling of his chronology and the clever changes of context from the claustrophobic warehouse section to various character origin flashbacks are sly and electric", "There are good performances all around as Reservoir Dogs veers to its ironic, almost absurdist climax. In addition to his clever plotting, Tarantino has given his cast sharp, acrid, sometimes witty dialogue.", "And while Tarantino never quite succeeds in putting around each character the sense of isolation that marks the best noirs, he carries off this exercise in lively fashion. It's more purple than noir, but it's got juice.", "No one should go to Reservoir Dogs without prior thought. But what they will see is a riveting treatise on the theme of betrayal set in an urban wasteland that murders hope and makes redemption virtually impossible.", "As QT's first film as both writer and director, Reservoir Dogs indicates a remarkably fully formed cinematic sensibility.", "The exaggerated raw violence of \"Reservoir Dogs\" leaves one feeling cheated in the end. For this movie isn't really about anything. It's just a flashy, stylistically daring exercise in cinematic mayhem.", "Perhaps it's a bit too knowing in places, and perhaps it packs in one pop cultural reference too many, but this is an in-your-face, look-at-me kind of debut, designed to function as the calling-card of a major new talent.", "...one of the most impressive debut features in cinematic history.", "No matter how many times you've freeze-framed the bit at the end, it's still up there with Die Hard and Taxi Driver as one of the great once-a-year indulgences.", "Brash, abrasive and unrelenting, this is a must-see.", "This movie is not for everybody. It's for hardly anybody. Fans of this kind of paperback-style bloodbath, however, will be held by the promise of a resolution as outlandish and as the rest of the picture.", "The film ends without a satisfying resolution, since these characters are so ugly only an agonizing affliction would qualify as just deserts. Crime doesn't exactly pay in this case, but it doesn't cost enough either.", "A superb character study of tough guys turning on each other, it is also an edgy drama about the dissolution of trust.", "The film, for all its mayhem and fury, is too distant to be truly disturbing; it treats everything with an impatient, born-too-late shrug.", "A brash, brutal crime-caper film, Reservoir Dogs has enough raw energy for 10 motion pictures and more than enough rough stuff to traumatize the sensitive. But not only does Dogs have teeth, it has brains.", "Tarantino's palpable enthusiasm, his unapologetic passion for what he's created, reinvigorates this venerable plot and, mayhem aside, makes it involving for longer than you might suspect.", "A much-acclaimed revisionist gangster film that I found to have more style than substance.", "Reservoir Dogs is hideously ugly in its materials, but in the sure way it's made and the vividness of the performances, it's a thing of beauty."], "rating": ["3/4", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "3.5/4", "5/5", "5/5", "3/4", "", "", "", "5/5", "4/5", "2.5/4", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tom Meek", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "PJ Nabarro", "Malcolm Johnson", "Jay Carr", "Derek Malcolm", "Chuck Bowen", "Kathleen Carroll", "Anne Billson", "David Nusair", "Total Film Staff", "David Parkinson", "Gary Thompson", "Ralph Novak", "Candice Russell", "Terrence Rafferty", "Jay Boyar", "Kenneth Turan", "Gene Siskel", "Stephen Hunter"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cambridge Day", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Globe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slant Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun"], "date": ["April 6, 2020", "August 30, 2019", "November 10, 2018", "June 6, 2018", "April 27, 2018", "March 20, 2018", "May 18, 2017", "January 21, 2016", "December 29, 2014", "January 15, 2014", "June 26, 2013", "June 26, 2013", "June 26, 2013", "June 26, 2013", "June 26, 2013", "June 26, 2013", "June 26, 2013", "June 26, 2013", "June 26, 2013", "June 26, 2013"]}}
