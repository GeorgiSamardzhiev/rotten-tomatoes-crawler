[Full Review in Spanish]", "Return of the Jedi is a very satisfying end to the original trilogy.", "Definitely more good than bad, the opening and the big Luke-Vader-Emperor showdown are great, it just has some weaker elements that drag the overall experience down.", "Return of the Jedi is a fitting, if not quite spectacular, end to a classic trilogy", "\"Return of the Jedi,\" the final act of George Lucas' first \"Star Wars\" trilogy, is the best one yet.", "It's not a total disappointment, but compared to its two predecessors, it's definitely a minor film. [Full review in Spanish]", "It's largely captivating at gigantic SFX and VFX spectacle; it's good at family movie and it's trivial at adult movie.", "'Jedi' takes a little longer to get going, but once it does, the Star Wars finale ends on a satisfying and rewarding note for fans who watch it for the first of 50th time.", "...a capper to a solid trilogy that's nevertheless not quite the flawless work its reputation would seem to indicate.", "There are all sorts of hints in the latest escapade (notionally directed by Richard Marquand) that we are meant to be taking it seriously.", "It's everything it ought to be -- glorious, exhilarating, exciting, absorbing, technically wondrous. But there also is something bittersweet in the knowledge that, with Jedi, we are bidding a fond farewell to all of the characters we got to know so well.", "The characters and dialogue get lost somewhere between the bug-eyed monsters and the exploding spaceships, but it is all so much fun it probably really does not matter a whole lot.", "The film has special effects so incredible that it will become the standard by which future efforts are measured, and it leaves the audience cheering and happy.", "With this last of the central Star Wars cycle, there is the sense of the closing of a circle, of leaving behind real friends. It is accomplished with a weight and a new maturity that seem entirely fitting, yet the movie has lost none of its sense of fun.", "Lucas has once again recycled the B movies of his youth: jungle movies, gangster movies, pirate movies, you name it.
