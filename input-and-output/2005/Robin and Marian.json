Fortunately, it has two of the best.\"", "The atmosphere is one of melancholy as Lester penetrates through the gauze of fantasy to find the human heart, and softly finds it beating.", "A Richard Lester film starring Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn has got to worth two hours of anybody's cinema-going time.", "[A] gorgeous, masterly elegy for a vanished age.", "A spotty picture that's sometimes satirical, a trifle pretentious, occasionally exciting.", "The idea of picking up the Robin Hood legend 20 years later seems okay at first consideration, but Goldman and Lester never got beyond the premise.", "The social satire gets precious at times, but Connery (sans hairpiece!) and Hepburn (swathed for the first hour in a nun's wimple) bring a fervid depth of feeling to their characters' rekindled courtship.", "It's one of those rare movies, like King Hu's Touch of Zen, that handles its historical imagery so cleanly, and contains its pretensions so solidly within sure characterisation and plotting, that it is often sublimely expressive.", "Overcomes its mediocre script by Lester's excellent visualizations, the pleasing performances from Connery and Hepburn, and the broad comedy that underscores this tragic story.", "", "", "Connery and Hepburn seem to have arrived at a tacit understanding between themselves about their characters.
