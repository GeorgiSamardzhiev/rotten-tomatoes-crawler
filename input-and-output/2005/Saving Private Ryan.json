You may walk out of the theater rich with indignation at the shamelessness of it all, but you cannot get rid of the lump in your throat.", "Steven Spielberg's war film, Saving Private Ryan, not only redefined the genre for war movies but the film holds up on the 20th anniversary.", "After a generation of films revisiting Vietnam, Steven Spielberg steered Hollywood back to the pride and accomplishment of \"the greatest generation.\"", "The visual masterwork finds Spielberg atop his craft, weaving heart-pounding action and gut-wrenching emotion that will leave viewers silently shaken... If words occasionally fail the picture, the images speak indelible volumes.", "[Saving Private Ryan] accomplishes something I had been taught was most difficult -- making an action-filled anti-war film or, at least, one that doesn't in some way glorify or lie about combat.", "Steven Spielberg's film is not perfect: it plays its strongest card first, the middle section is slightly uneven, and there are sallies into sentimentality. But it is a modern war classic.", "Saving Private Ryan is a masterpiece. It cements Steven Spielberg's reputation as one of the seminal filmmakers of the era.", "The result, I am sorry to say, is that Saving Private Ryan seems almost banal in its achievement, a film that sacrifices humanity for technical wizardry.", "One of Spielberg's most difficult \"problem\" films.", "The film is directed by Steven Spielberg, and breaks new ground in content and style. It merges some of the most realistically disturbing battle footage ever included in a feature film with a touching human story.", "This is Spielberg's way of showing that these warriors were ordinary men -- men who, if they survived, became the grandfathers and great-grandfathers who, these days, pass largely unnoticed through life.", "If Steven Spielberg's emotional intelligence matched his visual genius, his harrowing, passionately felt and honorably flawed new film might qualify for one of the greatest American movies ever made about World War II."], "rating": ["", "9/10", "", "5/5", "3/4", "A+", "A+", "", "", "", "", "", "4/4", "5/5", "", "", "7/10", "", "4/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Film Companion Staff", "Mike Massie", "Leigh Paatsch", "Peter Bradshaw", "CSM Staff", "Kent Garrison", "Brian Gill", "Ed Travis", "Louis Menand", "Danielle Solzman", "Sean Axmaker", "Michael Rechtshaffen", "Gene Siskel", "Martin Chilton", "Rex Reed", "Neil Norman", "Tim Brayton", "Jeff Strickler", "Matt Soergel", "Ella Taylor"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Companion", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Mad About Movies Podcast", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Mad About Movies Podcast", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinapse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New York Review of Books", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Solzy at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Stream on Demand", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Observer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Minneapolis Star Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Florida Times-Union", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">L.A.
