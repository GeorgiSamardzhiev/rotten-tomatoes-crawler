{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Photographer Adam Stanheight (Leigh Whannell) and oncologist Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) regain consciousness while chained to pipes at either end of a filthy bathroom. As the two men realize they've been trapped by a sadistic serial killer nicknamed \"Jigsaw\" and must complete his perverse puzzle to live, flashbacks relate the fates of his previous victims. Meanwhile, Dr. Gordon's wife (Monica Potter) and young daughter (Makenzie Vega) are forced to watch his torture via closed-circuit video.", "rating": "50", "genre": "Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "James Wan", "studio": "EvolutionEntertainment", "theater_date": "Oct 29, 2004", "dvd_date": "Oct 28, 2014", "box_office": "$650.1K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A twist ending for the ages always helps a genre shine up good for the camera.", "Say what you want about the acting or even the franchise as a whole, but Saw includes one of the most unforgettable endings that you won't see coming.", "Never terribly clever, but always intestinally challenging, this successful and discomfiting collection of films shows art in extremis-a real-time effort to take mainstream entertainment to its most brutal end point.", "The sound of Jigsaw's gravely voice pouring out of the tape recorder is still as ominous a sound as one could imagine, and the big reveals still come as a genuine shock.", "It may not be one of the horror greats that many people seem to make it out to be, but Saw is crafty and ambitious enough to warrant a horror buff's time.", "The horror flick Saw started a chain-Saw of sequels and that is now one of the most successful of the chop-and-slash variety. It's not a bad way to spend a Halloween evening.", "How such a cruelly empty and infantile movie got made is mystery enough. More puzzling is why Cary Elwes, Danny Glover and Monica Potter would sign on as co-stars.", "James Wan's horror film Saw is full of demented twists and guilty-looking actors, but the scenario is cruel enough to make you squirm.", "Saw is a sub-Se7en B-movie serial killer chiller with more high concepts stuffed into its 100 minutes than it can handle.", "[A] contrived, unlovable gore-fest with a high-concept premise.", "It is all, of course, total nonsense. But for horror fans it's good nonsense, in the way that a creepy urban legend told by flashlight in a tent at 2 a.m. can be fine and dandy nonsense.", "There's something impressively loathsome and extravagantly twisted about this horror-thriller from first-timer James Wan.", "As a study in the macabre, it barely suffices; as a sick and bloody joke, it's bloody sick.", "Though dumber than a box of rocks, Saw forges ahead with the kind of conviction and energy that will keep bad-cinema junkies sitting bolt upright.", "Just when you think you've got it sussed, the movie throws in some audacious twists, resulting in one of the most memorable climaxes in recent screen history.", "A pared-down psychological thriller with an ingenious hook, this grubby little B-movie gets straight As for effort.", "Inventive and diverting entertainment for fans of moody horror mysteries. And the end is cool. Say no more.", "[Its] sadism is topped only by its absurdity.", "More grisly than scary; not for kids.", "The horror genre takes a new direction using extreme violence to support a surprisingly evocative story of redemptive torture."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "3.5/5", "", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "3.5/5", "", "1/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Dan Buffa", "C.J.
