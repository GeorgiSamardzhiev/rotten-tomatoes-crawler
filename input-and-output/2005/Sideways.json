Soon Jack is sleeping with Stephanie (Sandra Oh), while her friend Maya (Virginia Madsen) connects with Miles.

This is a wonderfully written script, with a great performance by Paul Giamatti.", "Funny, touching, and features perhaps the best ensemble work of any film in recent memory. And like fine wine, the movie ages well upon reflection.", "A film that not only demands to be sampled but to be gulped down and savored like the vintage draft that it is.", "Unfolding at a relaxed tempo, and unobtrusively edited, Sideways is a welcome throwback to 1970s Bob Rafelson and Jerry Schatzberg.", "Where Payne's fondness for template narratives has started to become a problem, Sideways - as the title evinces - has much a more complex take on the possibility of catharsis", "A beautiful little chamber dramedy about four sharply-drawn characters played with a very lovely mixture of nuance and showmanship.", "Payne's most enjoyable movie since Election", "", "Payne does know how to capture two kinds of male menopause. But I can't say he ever surprised me.", "Excellent but explicit movie is not for kids.", "\"Sideways\" is about wine aged to perfection sipped by men who've aged to mediocrity - softer, hornier versions of Walter and The Dude. But Miles's brutal honesty is its soul. He's annoyingly, depressingly out there, but never fraudulent.", "Giamatti handily raises what could've been a pedestrian road trip romance into the stratosphere of a world-class character study", "A very memorable slice of life.", "This wonderfully satisfying study in human nature is funny and sad and profoundly entertaining from start to finish.", "Sideways stays resolutely life-size. And that, in this age of hype and hyperventilation, may be the most radical thing about it.", "Sideways is the first of Payne's films in which we have the chance to really care for the characters; he reins in his harsh satire better than before.", "No one does quivering-on-the-edge-of-depression quite like Paul Giamatti.", "This one's like to appeal greatly to the 30-40 somethings that are getting more and more into bourgeois sports such as yachting, polo or wine tasting.", "The year's second best movie about broken and lonely people (after Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind)."], "rating": ["4.0/4", "", "", "4/4", "5/5", "5/5", "4/5", "B", "", "", "4/5", "4/4", "3/4", "", "", "", "B+", "4/4", "B", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Anupama Chopra", "Micheal Compton", "Matthew Lucas", "Tom Dawson", "PJ Nabarro", "Tim Brayton", "John A.
