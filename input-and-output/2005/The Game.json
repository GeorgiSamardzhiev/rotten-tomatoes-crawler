{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Nicholas Van Orton (Michael Douglas) is a successful banker who keeps mostly to himself. When his estranged brother Conrad (Sean Penn) returns on his birthday with an odd gift -- participation in a personalized, real-life game -- Nicholas reluctantly accepts. Initially harmless, the game grows increasingly personal, and Orton begins to fear for his life as he eludes agents from the mysterious game's organizers. With no one left to trust and his money gone, Orton must find answers for himself.", "rating": "75", "genre": "Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 8m", "director": "David Fincher", "studio": "PolyGramFilmedEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 15, 2012", "box_office": "$48.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["\"[L]ooking back on it now, it's one of the man's most assured tales, a clockwork thriller that turns all of Fincher's detail-oriented obsessiveness into a surprisingly emotional tale of catharsis and dark nights of the soul.\"", "There is certainly plenty to appreciate here, but the issues of this particular story are just too significant to overlook.", "The plausibility of the whole thing is ludicrously farfetched, but that's the point - and the fun.", "The more we invest in Nicholas' bank of experiences, the more we display our willing complicity with, even subservience to, a system that lets cocooned elites merely play games (on an urban, even international scale)", "A classy thriller, and yet further evidence of how Michael Douglas was able to nail these WASP-in-peril roles.", "Douglas finally musters one of his best performances to carry Fincher's essay on self-reliance to its exciting, if absurd endgame.", "The rational side of my brain can pick this movie apart until all that's left is incoherent threads. The movie-mad side, happy to lose control, had a hell of a good time.", "...a top-tier thriller that doesn't always seem to get the respect and admiration it clearly deserves.", "Engaging '90s thriller has lots of violence, profanity.", "[N]ifty filmic style and crackpot sensibility.", "This is one of those movies that's so tightly written and densely plotted, it leaves no room for error -- or viewer queries. Unfortunately, the questions will start flying even before the picture's over.", "This 1997 thriller is fairly entertaining nonsense if all you're looking for is 128 minutes of diversion. But if you'd like something more from David Fincher, the director of Seven, don't get your hopes up.", "Sure, it strains credulity, but it's clever, well-paced and builds to a spectacular -- if not altogether satisfying -- conclusion.", "Good looking, tightly controlled thriller. An exhilarating ride that prepares the ground for Fight Club.", "Regardless of how far one chooses to buy into The Game -- and the ending ambiguously suggests that it could go on and on -- there is no doubt as to Fincher's staggering expertise as a director and his almost clinical sense of precision.", "\"The Game\" is a thrilling end run of deception in which a master manipulator is masterfully manipulated.", "The film's 'message' about complacency transformed by chaos and uncertainty is hackneyed...", "A solid original screenplay -- one of the best out of Hollywood this year.", "", ""], "rating": ["", "7/10", "9/10", "", "3/5", "", "", "3.5/4", "4/5", "5/10", "2.5/4", "", "3/4", "4/5", "", "4/4", "", "A-", "7/10", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Clint Worthington", "Marianna Neal", "Mike Massie", "Anton Bitel", "PJ Nabarro", "Malcolm Johnson", "David Ansen", "David Nusair", "Brian Costello", "Matthew Sorrento", "Matt Brunson", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Maitland McDonagh", "", "Todd McCarthy", "Phil Villarreal", "Geoff Andrew", "Robin Clifford", "Dragan Antulov", "Jim Shelby"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spool", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Impression Blend", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Little White Lies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arizona Daily Star", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reeling Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rec.arts.movies.reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Palo Alto Weekly"], "date": ["December 22, 2020", "December 17, 2020", "September 13, 2020", "July 27, 2020", "October 31, 2019", "June 8, 2018", "February 28, 2018", "October 22, 2017", "February 16, 2016", "October 18, 2012", "September 26, 2012", "October 4, 2011", "October 4, 2011", "October 4, 2011", "March 26, 2009", "April 29, 2007", "February 9, 2006", "April 9, 2005", "February 2, 2004", "May 20, 2003"]}}
