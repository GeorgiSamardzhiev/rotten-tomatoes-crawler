Scott Fitzgerald in the novel and by Owen Davis in the play. Occasionally it is a little bit silly and when it is not silly it is difficult to believe.", "None of the psychology of Gatsby's character; which is the reason for the story, is transferred to the screen. He might as well be a dramatized tailor's dummy for all the interest he arouses.", "The story follows the novel most religiously, but whether that has been in the best judgment is doubtful... The story doesn't seem weighty enough for the footage it consumes.", "It's a sophisticated story, told with first-rate lights and shadows. The spirit of the original is there with plenty to spare.", "Although Mr. Brenon has included the tragic note at the end, he has succumbed to a number of ordinary movie flashes without inculcating much in the way of subtlety. Neither he nor the players have succeeded in fully developing the characters.", "As a general entity the screen version of The Great Gatsby is good stuff... All the niceties and un-niceties of fast Long Island life of the type Fitzgerald dotes on criticizing and exposing are capable of elaborate exposition.", "Warner Baxter, in the name part, emerges as a new screen hero. Lois Wilson, is a charming heroine and William Powell and Hale Hamilton add to the strength of the cast.", "There are materials for a fine story in The Great Gatsby, and indeed the picture has passages which are deeply moving. But the general effect of it has been spoilt in the handling.", "The story is Impossible, of course, but who cares for possible tales? ... The story is worth while seeing merely as an interesting picture, played by good actors, set in magnificent scenes and well photographed."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Martin Dickstein", "Epes W.
