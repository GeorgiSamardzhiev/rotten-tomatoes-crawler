{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) lives a simple life with his fellow hobbits in the shire, until the wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen) arrives and convinces him to join a group of dwarves on a quest to reclaim the kingdom of Erebor. The journey takes Bilbo on a path through treacherous lands swarming with orcs, goblins and other dangers, not the least of which is an encounter with Gollum (Andy Serkis) and a simple gold ring that is tied to the fate of Middle Earth in ways Bilbo cannot even fathom.", "rating": "64", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 49m", "director": "Peter Jackson", "studio": "WingNutFilms", "theater_date": "Dec 14, 2012", "dvd_date": "Dec 11, 2015", "box_office": "$303.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["When it comes to the fantasy genre, it really doesn't get more epic than this.", "This is a film for true Tolkien connoisseurs.", "In the end you're left wondering how it went that way, and how in the hell are they going to squeeze two more movies out of this?", "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is an expected journey that radiates entertainment, majesty and wonder. [Full review in Spanish]", "While it doesn't have the same sense of urgency and darkness as the LOTR trilogy, An Unexpected Journey is a fun and welcomed adventure, filled with humor, spectacular visuals and great action sequences. [Full review in Spanish]", "Despite a few minor flaws, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a superb (and suitably epic) addition to Peter Jackson's past adaptations of Tolkien's work. See it in 3D and 48fps for the ultimate experience.", "It feels more scattershot than Jackson's prior films, a pastiche of set pieces that don't add up to a unified story.", "It feels much like a gentler, more humorous and watered-down version of The Fellowship of the Ring.", "If The Hobbit does become a huge hit, winning fans beyond the loyalists, it won't be the first bad movie to score at the box-office.", "As Bilbo Baggins, Martin Freeman... is a perfect mix of innocent wide-eyed wonder-filled man child and stodgy stick in the mud.", "A grand cinematic spectacle that demands our full surrender but doesn't overwhelm its simple tale of courage with its spectacular special effects.", "For the most part I found the whole excursion to be rather dull. The action is absent in long stretches, with what feels like an endless string of backstories.", "As the camera panned down over Hobbiton, the clarity of the colors and costumes made the scene look like a local RenFair-except, not even as gritty as that.", "The Hobbit is a long and bumpy walk worth taking.", "The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey is a very good two-hour film buried within a meandering 166 minutes.", "The results aren't quite so resonant, but the right notes are still being played, and we certainly come away fond enough of the characters and invested enough in their world to want to come back for more when it's ready.", "Bret MacKenzie returns as FIGWIT and it's about as jarring as Ed Sheeran in Game of Thrones but it's still good.", "It makes sense for Peter Jackson to want to fill out his canvas. Film can show certain things that prose cannot (and vice versa, obviously).", "The Hobbit feels like a mere rehash of The Lord of the Rings, with just a number of different characters.", "We've got a lot of road to travel before we'll know if the quest was worth it.
