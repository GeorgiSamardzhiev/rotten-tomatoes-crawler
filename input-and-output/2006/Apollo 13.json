[Full Review in Spanish]", "James Horner's score is so good.", "APOLLO 13 is...A-OK. In an era when cinematic heroics seem to be defined by bullets and brawn, it is a pleasure to see a movie in which the good guys triumph by using their brains!!!", "Tom Hanks is on his way to becoming the American Everyman, an exemplar of boyish goodwill and quiet moral force.", "Ron Howard's pop-entertainment you-are-there space thriller is easily the most rousing film of the year.
