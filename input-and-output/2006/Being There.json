{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Simple-minded Chance (Peter Sellers), a gardener who has resided in the Washington, D.C., townhouse of his wealthy employer for his entire life and been educated only by television, is forced to vacate his home when his boss dies. While wandering the streets, he encounters business mogul Ben Rand (Melvyn Douglas), who assumes Chance to be a fellow upper-class gentleman. Soon Chance is ushered into high society, and his unaffected gardening wisdom makes him the talk of the town.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 10m", "director": "Hal Ashby", "studio": "NatWestVentures,Enigma,LorimarFilmEntertainment,CIP,Northstar,BSB,Fujisankei", "theater_date": "Dec 19, 1979", "dvd_date": "May 7, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One of the rare cases in which a novel is translated into a film with its humor, insight, and pathos intact.", "The humor continues to surface, regularly generating laugh-out-loud bewilderment and crushing awkwardness.", "That ... Chance [is] perfectly aware of when others expect his contribution and of that contribution's general tenor, is nothing short of a high-wire act.", "Gently directed by Hal Ashby, this satire of a ruling class in which nobody knows anything is almost plausible, and certainly topical.", "The result must be one of the boldest of commercial comedies, for the way it turns on passages of dead time, the dreadful pauses while other characters struggle to see the significance in each of Chance's cryptically meaningless remarks.", "What started as a fable ends up being a satire and that is precisely where the story becomes tedious and long, at the same time that it shows its weakest side. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Closed out the 1970's with a knowing smile, mourning that which was to come, and celebrating an unassuming antidote to the decade's increasing sense of materialism and political polarization.", "Sellers is funny in every moment; you just have to watch very closely.", "Bolstered by Peter Sellers' wonderfully understated performance and a solid supporting cast, Kosinski's cleverly rewritten satire is brought to life effectively and entertainingly.", "A brutal look at America and Americans that gently lifts up the mirror image that television gives us of ourselves, smashes it on the marble floors of our political institutions and holds a chunk of jagged glass to our throats. And then makes us laugh.", "Sellers has never been better and he embellishes the detached, childlike innocence of this character with perfect style and timing. It's a deceptively simple performance, but it is essentially the core and substance of the film.", "Even in a chilly movie like this, deaths have resonance (whether they're on camera, or off).", "Here is a comedy that valiantly defies both gravity and the latest Hollywood fashion.", "Hal Ashby's satirical parable on the way the USA surrenders itself to homespun evangelicalism gives Peter Sellers the role of a lifetime.", "The movie's main effect is to confirm how versatile Sellers has always been.", "A Gumpish plot? Perhaps, but Being There is much more subtle and enigmatic than that.", "Peter Sellers gives a stellar performance.", "Amazingly poignant performance by Peter Sellers.", "a product not of Ashby's essential modesty but of Kosinski's essential egoism.", "If you are going to see only one Peter Sellers movie, see Dr. Strangelove, but if you're going to see two, then Being There also belongs on your must-see list."], "rating": ["", "9/10", "", "4/5", "", "", "4/4", "3/4", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "4/5", "", "4/5", "B", "4/5", "1/4", "8"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Barbara Brecher", "Mike Massie", "CJ Sheu", "Ed Potton", "Richard Combs", "Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos", "Matthew Lucas", "Josh Larsen", "Monica Reid", "Michael Blowen", "Ron Pennington", "Simon Miraudo", "Frank Rich", "Tom Hutchinson", "", "", "Dennis Schwartz", "Kelly Kessler", "Walter Chaw", "Brian Webster"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Berkeley Barb", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Review Film Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sight and Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">From the Front Row", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Far Out Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Globe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Quickflix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Freak Central", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Apollo Guide"], "date": ["January 11, 2021", "August 27, 2020", "July 1, 2020", "January 17, 2020", "January 16, 2020", "September 20, 2019", "June 4, 2019", "May 13, 2019", "August 27, 2018", "April 28, 2018", "December 19, 2016", "October 20, 2014", "July 8, 2014", "July 8, 2014", "July 8, 2014", "July 8, 2014", "January 26, 2012", "January 2, 2011", "May 20, 2009", "April 27, 2009"]}}
