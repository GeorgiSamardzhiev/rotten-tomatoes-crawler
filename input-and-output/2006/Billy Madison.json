{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Man-child Billy Madison (Adam Sandler) has been a spoiled rich kid all his life, and spends his days drinking and partying. When his father, hotel magnate Brian (Darren McGavin), becomes fed up with his son's irresponsible ways, he issues an ultimatum. Since Billy passed all his schooling thanks to his father's influence and bribes, he must retake and pass every grade in 24 weeks. Otherwise, the business will be turned over to Brian's conniving associate, Eric (Bradley Whitford).", "rating": "42", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 29m", "director": "Tamra Davis", "studio": "UniversalPictures,RobertSimondsProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$25.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...an exceedingly (and unabashedly) silly premise that's employed to mostly watchable (yet undeniably erratic) effect by Davis...", "A more moronic vehicle is hard to imagine.", "If you've ever had a yen to relive the third grade, this must be the next best thing.", "Billy Madison is a textbook example of a half-decent idea that never got developed beyond the \"lying around drinking beer and making jokes with your buddy\" stage.", "The latest entry in the American cinema's investigation of dumb-and-dumber heroes.", "The tepid moments far outnumber the truly wacky ones, and in the end Billy Madison earns a trip to comedy detention.", "While not in the same league as The Wedding Singer, it's still enjoyably dumb fun, especially for Sandler fans.", "Where Dumb And Dumber was clever enough to play dumb to amuse the child in all of us, this suffers under the illusion that just having a central character blissfully unaware of the need for a brain is actually a funny concept.", "Even with all the circuslike parties that celebrate our student prince's getting through yet another grade, Billy Madison barely merits passing marks.", "This is Adam Sandler at his best, and his latest films are cheap grabs at what once came so easily to him.", "Even on its own dim-bulb terms, this runt of a comedy never locates its central joke: Is it that Billy the child-man doofus doesn't fit in with his pint-size peers or that he fits in all too well?", "It's refreshing to revisit the jester in his screen infancy, when all he wanted was to boogie to a Culture Club hit, carry on conversations with hair care products, and sit on a sprinkler.", "Young teens will like brash, immature humor.", "Those unfamiliar with Sandler's antics may...begin to find him annoying sometime between the appearance of the Universal logo and the end of the opening credits.", "This role would seem the perfect vehicle for [Sandler] to display his talents, and he brings to it his full arsenal of weird voices and goony faces.
