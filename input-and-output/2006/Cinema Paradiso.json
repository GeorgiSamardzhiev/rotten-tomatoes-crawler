{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Young Salvatore Di Vita (Salvatore Cascio) discovers the perfect escape from life in his war-torn Sicilian village: the Cinema Paradiso movie house, where projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret) instills in the boy a deep love of films.

In the Director's Cut, it's still an excellent film, just not a transcendent one.", "A celebration of cinema's communal experience, this lovingly crafted ode to the joys projected upon the silver screen is a touching celebration of moviegoing.", "Although charming, its substance isn't overwhelmingly deep, serving more as a lighthearted, idealized, nostalgic coming-of-age tale than a stirring emotional investment.", "Ask me what it is about movies I love so much, and I'll tell you to see Cinema Paradiso for your answer.", "It's another clean, colorful community with an unreal sense of vitality, everyone playing a comfortable role in the neat storyline.", "Cinema Paradiso itself possesses enough command and self-conviction to demonstrate that movies can still manage to manifest an alternative universe.", "A treat.", "Giuseppe Tornatore's film is a charming and gently humorous work of semi-autobiography, composed with an attentive painter's eye and a cinematic cross- referencing of images and motifs.", "[Salvatore Cascio's] adorabilty-quotient can be a bit hard to take, but this is one of the better pieces of screen moppetry in recent years.", "This is one of the finest films about innocence ever made, a perfect picture of a time when the cinema was the only source of laughter and joy.", "A cinema-lover's delight.", "That balance of the ideal and the tragic weaves all throughout Cinema Paradiso, which is epic in terms of the time frame it covers, but feels consistently intimate", "Recent changes to cinema which have seen the projectionist's art sidelined in the digital age add a further layer of poignancy to the magical memories.", "It looks lovely and is full of classic, memorable moments, including a tear-jerking finale.", "One of the most delightful and affecting of all movie endings.", "Cinema Paradiso is much loved, though I have occasionally been the man in the Bateman cartoon: the reviewer who confessed to finding Cinema Paradiso a bit sugary and the kid really annoying.", "Tornatore may have hit a sticky wicket with his subsequent work, but he knew what he was doing here: warning us about the irrational lure of the filmed past, which is to say cinema itself, then ushering us grandly to our seats.", "Its confidence is staggering. And its commitment to a classic narrative that is also essentially a parable story, markedly unusual. They really don't make them like that any more.", "A bald-faced act of unalloyed, weapons grade sentimentalism in which humanity is drained of anything with even a passing resemblance to a soul.", "A movie that dispenses bittersweetness, nostalgia and uplift in potent doses."], "rating": ["4/4", "4/5", "8/10", "", "", "", "B+", "", "", "5/5", "", "3.5/4", "4/5", "5/5", "5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5", "2/5", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Matt Brunson", "Patrick Gamble", "Mike Massie", "Allen Almachar", "Bruce C.
