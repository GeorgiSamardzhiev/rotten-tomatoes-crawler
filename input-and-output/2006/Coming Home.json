[Full review in Spanish]", "Hal Ashby's Coming Home, the latest of the Vietnam war-oriented movies, is a sensitive, beautiful, and in the end disturbing account of the personal trauma of war and its far-reaching effects on all involved.", "Miss Fonda continues her gallery of sensitive portrayals, Dern is absolutely chilling when he confronts the lovers, Voigt is superb. Despite their efforts and the knowing direction of Hal Ashby, the overall effect is as depressing as the war itself.", "This movie is a big deal.", "Though well acted by Jon Voight and Jane Fonda (who won Oscars), Coming Home is one of Hal Ashby's weakest films, a middlebrow melodrama that wears its political message on its sleeves.", "The film has less to do with politics, women's or otherwise, than with a very conventional notion of the redemptive power of mother love. Which would be all right if director Hal Ashby had managed to mount it effectively.", "The performances, undeniably appealing, were deservedly praised, Dern and Voight coming off best.", "Coming Home is in general an excellent Hal Ashby film which illuminates the conflicting attitudes on the Vietnam debacle from the standpoint of three participants.", "A wonderful movie with stellar performances; though Dern is a bit of a caricature.", "Clich piles on clich to the strains of a garbled '60s soundtrack, but the movie's ending goes some way to recognising its failure. Fonda is magnificent.", "", "", "A powerful film about love and war.
