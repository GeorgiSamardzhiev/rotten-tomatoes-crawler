{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The klutzy yet stunning Rebecca Sommers (Jenny McCarthy) walks in on her hunky boyfriend in bed with another woman. They break up and Rebecca starts to fall apart, but, with the help of her close girlfriends, she begins to date again. Unfortunately, the men she meets all happen to be crazy. John (Eddie Kaye Thomas), her dorky guy friend, tries to express his secret love for Rebecca, but she's too busy to notice as she tries to come to terms with her breakup.", "rating": "6", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 31m", "director": "John Asher", "studio": "BigScreenEntertainmentGroup", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 22, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The sad part is that McCarthy's performance isn't even the worst of the film.", "Each moment, more unfunny than the last, is a record of underachievers who are so far in over their head that they have lost the will to break the chains of their prison.", "McCarthy is still not funny, never was, never will be.", "It doesn't make a lick of sense, largely because none of these characters acts like a recognizable human being.", "McCarthy is still a tremendously appealing presence, but her script about a gal who tries to move on after her himbo boyfriend kicks her to the curb is pure amateur hour.", "When Carmen Electra as a ghetto body waxer is the highlight of your film, you've got trouble.", "Dirty Love is in the worst possible taste.
