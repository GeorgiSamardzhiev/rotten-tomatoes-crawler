Taylor takes creative control of the group and eventually pushes the singers into the spotlight. However, one becomes the star, forcing another out, which teaches them about the high cost of fame.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "2h 11m", "director": "Bill Condon", "studio": "DreamWorksSKG,Paramount", "theater_date": "Jan 12, 2007", "dvd_date": "Jun 6, 2014", "box_office": "$103.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It has taken 25 years for Michael Bennett's Dreamgirls to go from Broadway to the big screen. The delay can be forgiven, however, because the film rocks on all levels.", "Very much rooted in its disco-era decadence, but it is always fiercely, vibrantly fresh", "Neither thought-provoking nor entertaining enough - remains largely average and underwhelming.", "While Dreamgirls has many fantastic attributes -- brilliant musical numbers, top performances, and some amazing camerawork and editing -- it doesn't quite gel, ensuring that this musical never moves from being a good film to a supreme one.", "This film could earn eight Oscar nominations. It's so much fun. Let's go see a movie where you smile, and cheer ... and tap your feet a little, too.", "The energy is so high in sequences like this -- and there are lots of them -- that it almost doesn't matter that we've seen this story before, in Ray and other film biographies about the \"heartbreak\" of musical stardom.", "Condon's adaptation is polished and enjoyable and yet something is missing from making it a truly great musical movie--perhaps a more coherent vision or unity.", "A musical for people who've forgotten how to listen, and how to feel", "It compares to that other \"legitimate\" musical smash of recent vintage, Chicago. It just doesn't have the life or fun of Chicago.", "A tight and entertaining musical with a show stealing performance by Jennifer Hudson.", "", "Dreamgirls opened on Xmas day and it was every much of a brilliant holiday movie. I guess the only complaint I have is it is too slick.", "There's a joy on screen -- a love for the material that's palpable and contagious -- but the material, in the end, lets them down.", "...Hudson offers up a seriously underwhelming performance...", "Worse than a movie of the weak (pun intended)", "You may not be expecting this from a musical, but Dreamgirls is one of the most fast-paced, frenetically-edited, roller-coaster rides of a movie that you'll see all year.", "Dreamgirls is a splashy film with a great cast, strong performances, terrific music and an engrossing, though...familiar, story.", "There's no faint-praise here. It's the best film of the year.", "Una lujosa producci\u00f3n que, a nivel dram\u00e1tico, tiene la misma profundidad que una telenovela.
