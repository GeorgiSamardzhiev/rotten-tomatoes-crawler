{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick), a well-liked high school government teacher, can't help but notice that successful student Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon) uses less than ethical tactics to get what she wants. When Tracy runs for school president, Jim feels that she will be a poor influence on the student body and convinces Paul, a dim-witted but popular student athlete, to run against Tracy. When she becomes aware of Jim's secret involvement in the race, a bitter feud is sparked.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Alexander Payne", "studio": "ParamountPictures,BonaFideProductions,MTVFilms", "theater_date": "May 7, 1999", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$14.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The young Reese Witherspoon leads with her determined chin as single-minded go-getter Tracy Flick...", "A remnant from the provocative period of Alexander Payne, Election is as deviously potent now as it was at the time of its release.", "Broderick gives a wonderfully nebbishy performance, and the filmmakers do a fine job of using visual cues to define the smallness of his world.", "Suffers from a tyrannical sameness of tone where Payne doesn't trust his audience to 'get' the crashing subtext, so he batters them over the head with it for nearly two hours", "Alexander Payne's Election remains one of the best political satire comedies of all time.", "An annihilating satire of the American experience, Election has never really been equaled for sheer truth-telling about the crushing awfulness of high school, which sets us up for the rotten lives we're going to live thereafter.", "The lack of emotion and seriousness with which some of his characters behave is surprisingly amusing. It's like Wes Anderson without the twee set designs and world-building.", "The comedy may not resonate as deeply as the well-named Payne intends, but between Witherspoon's exuberant solipsism and Broderick's talent for absorbing massive humiliation, the chuckles keep coming like poisoned darts.", "Alexander Payne's wicked satire of power and (social) politics set in the overheated incubator of a high school student body election is as sharp and perceptive now as it was in 1999.", "Payne and Taylor are equal opportunity satirists and their sly wit dismantles everything from high school culture to suburban complacency.", "This clever, biting high-school satire is arguably Alexander Payne's most original and accomplished film (and so far he has made only good pictures).", "Dark high school comedy is best for older teens.", "Surprise! An intelligent, well-written high school story that offers some real ideas to chew on, rather than simply wallowing in nubile flesh.", "The treatment of this touchy material is impressive, neither gratuitous nor mincing, but this 1999 satirical comedy doesn't really go anywhere.", "An instant classic, Alexander Payne's 1999 high school comedy seems even more scathing now that we're losing control of our own election machinery.", "Election at first has the feel of a simple work. But don't let that fool you; it's a complex, deep tale.", "Took the sleaze of the teen comedy and spun it into something that's both hugely entertaining and extremely insightful.", "A funny and horrifying allegory of American politics and adult society, as seen through the prism--or shall we say \"prison\"?--that is secondary education. [Blu-ray]", "Maybe its only real fault is that it's a little too close to the truth to be as funny as it could be.", "[A] wicked, carnal comedy."], "rating": ["", "3.5/5", "", "3/5", "", "", "8/10", "", "", "", "A", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "", "4/4", "7/10", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Alison Gillmor", "Nicholas Bell", "Noel Murray", "PJ Nabarro", "Danielle Solzman", "Eileen Jones", "Chris Ingalls", "David Ansen", "Sean Axmaker", "Sean Axmaker", "Emanuel Levy", "Kelly Kessler", "Maitland McDonagh", "Lisa Alspector", "J.
