{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The brilliant scientist Jan Benes (Jean Del Val) develops a way to shrink humans, and other objects, for brief periods of time. Benes, who is working in communist Russia, is transported by the CIA to America, but is attacked en route. In order to save the scientist, who has developed a blood clot in his brain, a team of Americans in a nuclear submarine is shrunk and injected into Benes' body. They have a finite period of time to fix the clot and get out before the miniaturization wears off.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Richard Fleischer", "studio": "20thCenturyFox", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A nonstop adventure of sizable proportions.", "Technically, the film is only too obviously under all kinds of strain, as if trying to live up to a budget which it never wanted in the first place.", "Ignoring the painfully slow first third, the rest of the film is an enjoyable, basic sci-fi adventure. It won't wow you, but it will entertain you.", "With such titles as 2001: A Space Odyssey and Planet of the Apes, the 1960s proved to be a particularly rich decade for science fiction cinema, and Fantastic Voyage stands as one of the period's most imaginative efforts.", "\"Fantastic Voyage\" is a fun adventure with some incredible sets representing the inside of the human body. What it lacks in reality is made up by beauty and skill.", "Not be as suspenseful as it once was, because we've seen many shots of the body's interior and we no longer have the undercurrents of the Cold War that made life itself an edge-of-the-seat affair. But it's still a fun sci-fi excursion.", "Despite the film being nearly 50 years old, it's still pretty impressive what they were able to accomplish using practical photography. Sure it's campy, but it's the kitschy design that makes it so much fun to watch.", "That it carries the viewer along is thanks largely to its kitsch charm, its energetic pace and the stunning sets designed by Harper Goff.", "Half planetarium, half lava lamp", "Fascinating still, but suffers from lack of more sophisticated special effects. Still...imagine Raquel Welch moving around inside.", "Their voyage through the body's bloodstream past assorted organs was created by inventive special effects that make this one of the more visually interesting science fiction films of its era.", "The lavish production, boasting some brilliant special effects and superior creative efforts, is an entertaining, enlightening excursion through inner space -- the body of a man.", "This special effects extravaganza from 1966 has proved surprisingly enduring, despite a technical quality crude by contemporary standards; perhaps it's the screwball poetry of the plot.", "...our own human interior was revealed, like a Jacques Cousteau travelogue, in screen-filling vistas of surreal canals and chambers filled with floating psychedelia and the amorphous Jell-O colors of a Jimi Hendrix concert.", "An opportunity missed, therefore -- especially as the imaginative sets are slightly tackily realised -- but fun all the same.", "", "Well directed science fiction", "", "All I can tell you is it is quite a trip.", "Call this one big-time guilty pleasure.
