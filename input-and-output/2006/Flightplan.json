{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Airplane engineer Kyle Pratt (Jodie Foster) is heading home from Germany to New York on a double-decker Elgin 474 to bury her husband.

Nothing becomes clear until late in the film, by which time you should be fully gripped by this bizarre mystery.", "Sets up its premise quickly, then simply has nowhere to go.", "The alternations between reality and illusion could have been intriguing but the filmmaker doesn't want to go on that track at all.", "It's always a bad sign in a thriller when the big reveal is greeted by hoots of derisive laughter.", "As with many modern thrillers the actual plot, once it comes to light, is highly implausible, there are a few too many turns towards the end and the climax errs towards the anti-climatic. That being said, it's well put together and entertainingly moody.", "Tense but riveting thriller, best for teens+.", "If it's post 9/11, why would they have a plane with bathrooms that lead to tunnel-sized ventilators that have access to the plane's machinery?!", "", "a white-knuckle ride into the anxieties and terrors of the new millennium... Fasten your seatbelts.", "Following a smooth takeoff, this psychological thriller hits some turbulence and crash lands due to a preposterous, almost comical, turn of events.", "Foster is a master at portraying a woman in terror who's trying to balance her fears with a survival instinct that drives her to somehow prevail.", "full review in Greek", "While I do think that Foster and the movies she makes need to lighten up, that isn't quite what I have in mind.", "The bickering back and forth between Foster and Sarsgaard becomes tiresome. And the erriness dissipates without anything as interesting to replace it.", "", "A disposable B-movie without much excitement or ingenuity.", "", "It's not a good movie despite its stylishness and performances, but it does have a short window of appeal for reasons entirely independent of its plausibility.", "Jodie Foster, the real-life mother of two young sons, follows 'Panic Room' with another thriller that allows her to physicalize her maternal instincts into action-movie heroics.
