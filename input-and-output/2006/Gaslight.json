While there, she falls in love with the charming Gregory Anton (Charles Boyer). The two return to London, and Paula begins to notice strange goings-on: missing pictures, strange footsteps in the night and gaslights that dim without being touched.

[Full review in Spanish]", "Director George Cukor successfully implements the proper atmosphere of claustrophobia and dread, aided by Joseph Ruttenberg's camerawork and the Oscar-winning set design.", "It's a superbly creepy thriller, with universal themes...An essential movie in anyone's canon.", "Gaslight serves as a fascinating depiction of psychological torture. What strikes me about it the most is the way patriarchy and male dominance play out in the narrative.", "Direction by George Cukor is ever a display of fine craftsmanship. He utilizes small mosaics of sharp characterization in building to his climax and works in each facet faultlessly. This is the job for which Cukor admirers have been waiting.", "We rely on the actors and the script to convey the mood, and director George Cukor matched no less a figure than Alfred Hitchcock with the results.", "It's a bit dated now, but still has much to offer, notably George Cukor's intelligent direction.", "George Cukor conjures up an oppressive atmosphere... But it's not quite enough to cover up the script's yawning gaps in logic.", "This 1944 film is one of the few psychological thrillers that is genuinely psychological, depending on subtle clues -- a gesture, an intonation -- to thought and character.", "Boyer nearly steals the picture, aided and abetted by the stunning debut of Angela Lansbury as a hardbitten servant -- only 18, she grabbed the role and chewed it to bits.", "Overwrought to contemporary eyes, perhaps, but still troubling and, in its own way, powerful.", "Brilliant classic of mind-game suspense.", "Patrick Hamilton's London stage melodrama, is given an exciting screen treatment by Arthur Hornblow Jr's excellent production starring Charles Boyer, Ingrid Bergman and Joseph Cotten.", "Classic drama-horror with put upon Bergman and suavely evil Boyer.", "Soaked in paranoia, Cukor's superb pyschological thriller is a period film noir, just like Hitchcock's The Lodger and Hanover Square, both set in the Edwardian age.", "Prepare yourselves rather for a lengthy and restless stretch on tenterhooks.", "", "A terrific atmospheric thriller."], "rating": ["", "9/10", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "3/5", "", "4/4", "3/4", "5/5", "", "5/5", "A", "", "3/5", "B"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Ida Belle Hicks", "Mike Massie", "Elena de la Torre", "Matt Brunson", "Paul Byrnes", "Jourdain Searles", "THR Staff", "Rob Vaux", "Tony Sloman", "", "Dave Kehr", "", "Josh Larsen", "Nell Minow", "Variety Staff", "Steve Crum", "Emanuel Levy", "Bosley Crowther", "Philip Martin", "Dennis Schwartz"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fort Worth Star-Telegram/DFW.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cine-Mundial", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Frenzy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sydney Morning Herald", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fishnet Cinema", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema-stache", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dispatch-Tribune Newspapers", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews"], "date": ["November 24, 2020", "August 5, 2020", "September 18, 2019", "July 13, 2019", "September 13, 2018", "August 27, 2018", "May 4, 2017", "March 15, 2017", "February 4, 2014", "February 4, 2014", "February 4, 2014", "February 4, 2014", "July 30, 2012", "December 24, 2010", "May 20, 2008", "December 21, 2006", "July 5, 2006", "March 25, 2006", "January 29, 2005", "December 8, 2004"]}}
