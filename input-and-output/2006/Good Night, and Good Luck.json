{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When Senator Joseph McCarthy begins his foolhardy campaign to root out Communists in America, CBS News impresario Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) dedicates himself to exposing the atrocities being committed by McCarthy's Senate \"investigation.\" Murrow is supported by a news team that includes long-time friend and producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney). The CBS team does its best to point out the senator's lies and excesses, despite pressure from CBS' corporate sponsors to desist.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "George Clooney", "studio": "WarnerIndependentPictures,Metropolitan,SectionEightLtd.,2929Productions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 9, 2009", "box_office": "$31.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A powerful film for family viewing that could open the door to discussions about family, friendship, loyalty, politics, and a variety of other topics.", "...an odd but fitting companion piece to Capote.", "In terms of historical content, the film is neither quite honest nor quite true. That's a shame, because it's a great film.", "Documentary realism keeps Good Night from collapsing into a morality tale. McCarthy plays himself, in hair-raising video footage from his witch-hunt hearings.", "A film that engages the mind and the heart in ways that few films do.", "Though the subject matter is serious, Good Night, and Good Luck bristles with humor and intelligence. You want \"Must See TV\"? Here it is.", "Good Night and Good Luck will make my 10-best list. It's unquestionably one of the best films of the year.", "Shorn of flash and dazzle in a way Murrow would appreciate, Good Night, and Good Luck practises what it preaches. It might be the result of wires and lights in a box, but it feels like a slice of life.", "By its end, \"Good Night, and Good Luck\" evolves into a prophetic vision of how television and film can be used to illuminate or insulate, educate or entertain.", "Untethered to any post-TV era is a conclusion that America gets too comfortable with the mental inactivity it enables. Edward R. Murrow's titular signoff begins as a trademark and ends as a challenge to a medium - one too often unmet today.", "Lean study of the quandaries of asking questions in the media, and of crafting a political film in Hollywood", "A film that will live on for years, because it bears a message about dissension, and the power of the press. A power that's faded.", "Provocative, principled and richly detailed, this is compelling stuff. Emotionally it(TM)s a little dry, but as brain-food, it(TM)s absolutely invigorating. George done good.", "Dignified, intelligent filmmaking for liberal grown-ups.", "Scrupulously journalistic, sometimes to its credit, sometimes to its deficit as a movie.", "Good Night is not your average historical recreation. It doesn't dumb-down its story or its characters with needless explanation for the benefit of an under-educated audience.", "proves that it is still possible in the cinema, if not in television, to inform without being boring and entertain without condescending.", "bez obzira na plemenite namjere svojih tvoraca, ipak ne zaslu%u017Euje \"Oscara\", jer je iznevjerio visoke standarde objektivnosti koje pripisuje svom junaku.", "Having your heart in the right place doesn't quite compensate for keeping your mouth somewhat shut and turning the volume down to an ideological whisper.", "Clooney's excellent film uses the past to make today's media and their audiences address their responsibilities."], "rating": ["4.0/4", "", "", "", "4/4", "5/5", "A-", "", "A-", "3.5/4", "", "", "4/5", "", "4/5", "4/4", "4/5", "4/10", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "David Lamble", "Zadie Smith", "Brian D.
