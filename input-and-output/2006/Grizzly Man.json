{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Pieced together from Timothy Treadwell's actual video footage, Werner Herzog's remarkable documentary examines the calling that drove Treadwell to live among a tribe of wild grizzly bears on an Alaskan reserve. A devoted conservationist with a passion for adventure, Timothy believed he had bridged the gap between human and beast. When one of the bears he loved and protected tragically turns on him, the footage he shot serves as a window into our understanding of nature and its grim realities.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Documentary", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Werner Herzog", "studio": "LionsGateEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 26, 2016", "box_office": "$3.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Grizzly Man is a documentary that shows the very essence of human nature pushed to the limit, where love and obsession can propel a person beyond the boarders of reason.", "A stirring documentary that adds to an already growing list of fascinating films from the genre this year.", "Of course, the legendary filmmaker can't resist inserting his own outsize ego into the story, but somehow this documentary has room for two larger-than-life characters.", "Herzog has his documentary in hand, explaining that what we have here \"iz on astone-ishing story of beauty and depth\". He's not wrong.", "Herzog's stirring, thought-provoking documentary meditates with exceeding insight into the mind that drove the man.", "Werner Herzog forgoes judging Timothy Treadwell's disputed methods or questionable mental state - letting viewers decide based on footage that suggests Treadwell essentially sought some sort of transmutation from flesh to fur.", "Remarkable beauty and wonder", "Did we really need the poorly staged interviews and confrontations...?", "", "Like so much of Herzog's work, both narrative and documentary, this is an engrossing look at obsessive behavior gone terribly awry.", "Treadwell, a failed TV actor, is presented as someone desperate to give and receive love. That he went to such extremes is tragic, but also, in Herzog's sympathetic eyes, deeply human.", "As a character critique it is hardly a mauling, for Herzog is too sophisticated a thinker, too respectful towards his subject, and altogether too humane to tear Treadwell apart for a second time.", "", "An amazing, provocative and ultimately creepy film.", "chilling", "Uma das maiores obras-primas da carreira de um cineasta que vem conquistando, ao longo dos ltimos 44 anos, um lugar mais do que merecido entre os cones da Stima Arte.", "After having gorged on nonfiction films that tell us what to think, Werner Herzog's Grizzly Man is an improbable palate cleanser, allowing us to not know what to think and encouraging us to admit as much.", "Part punk wildlife doc, part diary of a twisted soul, part cautionary tale, Grizzly Man is a complex, unique and engrossing journey into the murky recesses of an unhinged mind.", "Makes us feel like kids at a Punch and Judy show wanting to shout out \"Behind you!\"", "Not really a nature film (unless maybe human nature?). I just couldn't help but feel it was more opportunistic than inspired.
