{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Roy Eberhardt (Logan Lerman) has moved so often he has lost track of how many times he has changed schools. After moving from Montana to Florida's Gulf Coast, he befriends Beatrice (Brie Larson) and her brother. The siblings show Roy their hideaway, where they secretly take care of a flock of wild owls. When they learn that a restaurant will be built where the owls live, the three decide to enlist the help of a local policeman (Luke Wilson) to save the birds.", "rating": "26", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 27m", "director": "Wil Shriner", "studio": "WaldenMedia", "theater_date": "May 5, 2006", "dvd_date": "May 23, 2016", "box_office": "$8.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The cinematic equivalent to a Jimmy Buffett concert aimed squarely at children and youth.", "Soporific effort.", "Promoting environmental conservation, this bland family film never generates much interest in either its human or animal participants.", "A safe, slight film that doesn't possess the chaotic hilarity I associate with Carl Hiaasen's best writing.", "The only highlight is a sequence of outstanding cinematography in Florida's Everglades. Oh, and there's one funny joke. But that doesn't make this film a hoot at all.", "It's hard to hate a movie that essentially just wants to teach kids to respect the environment especially when that lesson is imparted in such an upbeat manner. But Hoot is also too bland and clumsy to wholeheartedly embrace.", "Hoot in retrospect won't really offer your children anything they haven't already seen, and it's just another preachy environmental film that talks down to them. Have you seen Akeelah and the Bee?", "The teen actors, the humor and the inspiring footage of Florida's unique landscape make Hoot worthwhile, and kids should enjoy it.", "The most important thing to know...is that it's co-produced by Jimmy Buffett, who also appears in a small role and provides new music for the soundtrack.", "The story is contrived, the transitions are clumsy, and much of the acting is weak.", "The least irritating adult in sight is also the least relevant: Officer Delinko (amiable Luke Wilson) tries to help the kids.", "Younger kids will find the pranks and schemes funny, while the enviro-activist theme is an important message to which they may just latch on. The eco-responsibility part, not the venomous snake part, one hopes.", "Parents may role their eyes more than once at this flightless film.", "This sweet-natured but plodding adaptation of a young-adult novel by Carl Hiaasen could have used a little less broad satire of corporate greed and a few more, well, owls. The critters peep from their burrows for only a few brief moments.", "An environmentally conscious Newbery Honor novel has been turned into a disappointing and uninspired movie.", "The three leads are likable, but they can't overcome a slapdash story or some wild overacting by the likes of Luke Wilson, Tim Blake Nelson, Neil Flynn and Clark Gregg.", "It's hard to give a hoot about Roy or any of his furtive feathered friends when they're surrounded by a nest of dreary cliches.", "Gets points for sweetness and a nice message, but that's all, folks", "Shriner just doesn't have the skills yet to turn lightweight scuffle into heavyweight preaching without bringing down the whole production.", "The owls are awfully cute. The eco message is awfully sincere. Beyond that, you probably won't give much of a \"Hoot\" about this mediocre family movie."], "rating": ["3.0/4", "C", "", "2/5", "1/4", "", "2/5", "3.5/5", "", "", "", "3/4", "2/5", "", "2/5", "2/5", "1/4", "5/10", "C+", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Dennis Schwartz", "Tim Grierson", "Jette Kernion", "Todd Hertz", "Ethan Alter", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Marcianne Miller", "Luke Y.
