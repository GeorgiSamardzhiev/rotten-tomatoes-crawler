{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Nikki (Laura Dern), an actress, takes on a role in a new film, and because her husband (Peter J.

For Lynch detractors, it will be a torture method more effective than the rack.", "The one thing that David Lynch can do is to leave you with a lingering feeling. Long after a host of other films have come and gone, elements from his films stay lodged in your brain.", "A terrifying nightmare to lose yourself in.", "", "Trippy, twisty thriller is totally out to Lynch.", "Unspeakably beautiful", "The three-hour movie is at once inscrutable and deeply satisfying for its daring high wire act of narrative illusion and passionately charged emotions.", "While the narrative is away with the bunnies, as a mood piece Lynch scores a slam dunk.", "A crazy midnight roller coaster ride to Lynchland. A movie you might half dream through an all night marathon of noir and slasher films, your heart pumping with caffeine.", "It's a movie spent inside Lynch's complicated head.", "While it is not nearly as good as Mulholland Drive, this latest complex concoction is fascinating in parts; even if you don't understand it", "Inland Empire is about the effects of movies themselves - the way they change us, inform our goals, and impact our self-image.", "It's an abstract jazz riff, it's a painting, it's a monster movie and a musical and a psychodrama and an ellipsis made of black holes.", "It is challenging but simultaneously exhilarating as we travel through this never-waking nightmare.", "Sprawls onto the screen as if it had escaped directly from within David Lynch's mind, not like an alien creature let off its leash for the first time.", "this story of magic, madness and metempsychosis will have you feeling like a rabbit trying to puzzle out what exactly is going on as wilder wolves circle and headlights career toward you out of the darkness.", "...ideal for those who thought [David Lynch's] Mulholland Drive was too simple and straightforward...", "It's also too long and too reminiscent of Lynch's other work.
