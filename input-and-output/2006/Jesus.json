[Full Review in Spanish]", "Jes\u00fas is less about juvenile delinquency than it is about violence that stems from adolescents testing limits and as a result losing control of the situation.", "Fernando Guzzoni's film is unnecessarily exploitative at worst and middling at best.", "The Chilean director projects the angst of adolescence in a casually-paced drama about violence and family dysfunction.", "Guzzoni's movie is an unsparing portrait of aimlessness told mostly in the queasiest shades ...", "One feels the filmmaker trying hard to work out the inner struggles of his sad but largely unsympathetic characters. But his movie is as miserable and ultimately confounding as it is earnest.", "Investigates its moral quandaries with a rigor this kind of bad-seed street-teen movie usually can't manage.", "Fernando Guzzoni's Jesus is at its best when it steers clear of pat moralizing and simply yokes its moody sense of atmosphere to the aimlessness of the story's young characters.", "With a bleak finale that won't soon leave you, Jess proves a gripping cautionary tale unafraid to let its characters suffer for justice.", "Jesus' sex scenes are pretty explicit but this actually serves a purpose, as the studiedly careless way in which Guzzoni has choreographed and shot them helps suggest something about the character's more than casual attitude towards intimacy.", "Superbly lensed in a jittery chiaroscuro by Uruguayan cinematographer Barbara Alvarez, \"Jess\" investigates the darkest side of adolescence, raising a number of moral questions without providing easy answers.", "At moments in Jess... you're close to thinking you've seen it all before, but a delve into the vacant world of a teenage boy and his pals later takes a turn towards something different.", "The kind of movie one only ever encounters at a film festival...", "Like a Chilean Larry Clark, Guzzoni shows a talent for raw, unsettling storytelling."], "rating": ["9/10", "", "", "B", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "B+", "", "", "", "1.5/4", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Juan Pablo Russo", "Alexander Ryll", "Michael McNeely", "Harvey S.
