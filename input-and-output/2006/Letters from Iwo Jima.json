{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Long-buried missives from the island reveal the stories of the Japanese troops who fought and died there during World War II. Among them are Saigo (Kazunari Ninomiya), a baker; Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara), an Olympic champion; and Shimizu (Ry\u00f4 Kase), an idealistic soldier. Though Lt. Gen. Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) knows he and his men have virtually no chance of survival, he uses his extraordinary military skills to hold off American troops as long as possible.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 21m", "director": "Clint Eastwood", "studio": "AmblinEntertainment,MalpasoCompany,WarnerBros.,DreamWorksSKG", "theater_date": "Feb 9, 2007", "dvd_date": "Dec 1, 2008", "box_office": "$13.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One must give Eastwood a good deal of credit ... To make a film about the suffering \"your\" soldiers endure is one thing, to make one about the horrors inflicted on the \"enemy\" is something else again.", "Infinitely more compelling than its predecessor, yet equally lengthy and ill-paced.", "A subdued masterpiece with a unique perspective on war.", "In coming to understand the point of view of the opposing side, Eastwood has crafted two masterful and distinct films who are still inexorably intertwined that speak to the simple humanity in all of us.", "You realize how very young many of these men were, and how ill-suited to be turned into killing machines.", "Modern-day echoes of being snookered into a bad war aren't lost on Clint Eastwood, and \"Letters from Iwo Jima\" delivers an overwhelmingly powerful eulogy for the death of righteousness in combat on either side of the line.", "Not an anti-war tract or a glorification but, rather, a fair consideration of humanity that exists within the inhumanity of armed conflict.", "Eastwood's cinema is one of resolutely moral images", "Eastwood is a master of the extended look (this comes from the two directors he acknowledges as his own masters, Sergio Leone and Don Siegel), the look that stretches time and that is blinded by what it sees.", "The most important film of 2006 was Clint Eastwood's Letters from Iwo Jima. In 20 years Letters from Iwo Jima will be a classic.", "War is hell, always has been, and movies will continue to confirm it for anyone who might doubt. In this case, though, Letters only shows that for all the different perspective the other side of a war could have, it's the same old movie clich\u00e9s.", "Eastwood's direction is a thing of beauty, blending unblinking ferocity with fragile delicacy.", "Both technical grace and an efficient ensemble smooth over some...clunky plotting.", "A fine, textured study of war, one that considers the strategic side as well as the human side without sacrificing either.", "Watching the film, I had admiration for what Eastwood and his writers were attempting, but I remained at arm's length. I'm not entirely sure why I could not buy into the film.", "Much as already been made about the pride and honor of the Japanese, but as a people they have rarely, if ever, been depicted as fully human characters in American war movies. It's amazing to think what Clint Eastwood has done here.", "... Eastwood takes this film out of the realm of a typical war picture to illuminate the boundless nature of the human spirit, which extends far beyond race and nationality.", "In Letters, the glossy romanticism of history crumbles before our very eyes.", "Eastwood has made a film that is thoughtful, poignant, touching, and philosophical. It stands as one of the best works in his long, illustrious career.", "A Japanese war flick comprised of contrasting character portraits of soldiers torn between dying with honor and the very human instinct of self-preservation."], "rating": ["", "6/10", "A-", "4/4", "", "4/4", "", "", "3.5/4", "4.0/5", "3/5", "8/10", "", "5/5", "B-", "4/4", "", "", "3.5/4", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Mike Massie", "Micheal Compton", "Matthew Lucas", "Ian Buruma", "Nick Rogers", "Donald J.
