{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Affluent and arrogant businessman Goddard Bolt (Mel Brooks), feuding with rival Vance Crasswell (Jeffrey Tambor) over a land deal, makes a bet with Crasswell that he has the wits and street smarts to live penniless and anonymous on the rough streets of Los Angeles for 30 days. But Bolt has a rude awakening when the reality of homelessness hits him. Still, he finds a silver lining in a burgeoning romance with Molly (Lesley Ann Warren), a former Broadway dancer who has fallen on hard times.", "rating": "18", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Mel Brooks", "studio": "Brooksfilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 20, 2015", "box_office": "$3.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Lurches from a shocking reality into sentimentality and then to a finale in which it only takes a fairy Goddard to wave his lovely dollar wand and all the derelicts and poor of Los Angeles can live happily ever after in low-cost housing.", "Even comic geniuses are allowed an off-day -- or off-movie, as the case may be -- and Mel Brooks strikes out with this sizable flop.", "A slapstick vaudeville about the poor and homeless?
