As Bond tries to unravel the mastermind's plan, he meets Solitaire (Jane Seymour), a beautiful tarot-card reader, whose magic is crucial to the crime lord.", "rating": "65", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 1m", "director": "Guy Hamilton", "studio": "DanjaqProductions,EonProductionsLtd.", "theater_date": "Jun 27, 1973", "dvd_date": "Oct 1, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Will James Bond live on in the 1970s? Not much farther, if this episode is anything to go by.", "It is good, lively, mindless entertainment, slow to warm up but once embarked upon its improbable story quick to appreciate its own absurdity.", "Live and Let Die's flaws are apparent, but it's still a solid adventure, and Moore fits smoothly into the role of Bond. It's an enjoyable film, and that's really all you could ask for.", "Considering the blandness of this eighth theatrical chapter, it's miraculous that further adventures would make it to the big screen.", "If Live and Let Die was Moore's acid test, then he passed the test.", "While [Bond's] latest adventure looks as though his producers had trimmed a few million dollars off the budget, it is still fast, funny and frivolous enough to satisfy.", "Stands as proof to the maxim that James Bond and the 1970s simply didn't mix.", "Far from the worse offender in Roger Moore's outings as Bond. A boring boat chase and a slapstick final fate for our villain definitely takes it down a peg or two though...", "If you want to see an out of place Bond effort that would have been vastly improved with Shaft or Superfly in the lead role instead of 007, give this a view.", "There are some splendid action sequences, notably a speedboat leap that set a new world record, as well as the usual array of hi-tech gadgetry.", "As fastpaced and snappily entertaining a piece of claptrap as we have a right to expect.", "So-so '70s Bond entry has sex, drugs, action violence.", "I can see how many people can be entertained by this ludicrous film, but not because it's good. It features an outstanding performance from Moore and has an enjoyably bad Blaxploitation thing going on here, but not much else.", "Roger Moore's first 007 job is still top entertainment.", "In the longest tenure of any James Bond performer, Roger Moore would certainly have higher highs and lower lows. And while it strays from Bond formula in ways good and bad, it's a fine introduction to a 007 more prone to crack wise than crack heads.", "The first outright terrible Bond picture.", "Tacky and cartoonish.", "I know I probably shouldn't like Live and Let Die, but I do. This crackpot entry, the eighth, in the long-running James Bond series, is figuratively all over the map...[Blu-ray]", "Guy Hamilton's direction lacks enthusiasm and pace, while even the art direction -- long the Bond films' real secret weapon -- seems to have fallen to a shrunken budget.", "Moore acquits himself in a larger than life adventure peppered with enjoyably rotten gags and lots of playful action."], "rating": ["", "", "", "2/10", "3/5", "", "2/5", "3/5", "4/10", "4/5", "", "3/5", "2/4", "3/5", "3.5/5", "5/10", "B-", "3/4", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["John Russell Taylor", "Derek Malcolm", "Jake Tropila", "Mike Massie", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Dick Lochte", "PJ Nabarro", "David Hogan", "Jeffrey Lyles", "Tom Hutchinson", "Christopher Hudson", "Jeffrey M.
