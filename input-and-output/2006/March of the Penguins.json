{"metadata": {"synopsis": "At the end of each Antarctic summer, the emperor penguins of the South Pole journey to their traditional breeding grounds in a fascinating mating ritual that is captured in this documentary by intrepid filmmaker Luc Jacquet. The journey across frozen tundra proves to be the simplest part of the ritual, as after the egg is hatched, the female must delicately transfer it to the male and make her way back to the distant sea to nourish herself and bring back food to her newborn chick.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Documentary", "runtime": "1h 20m", "director": "Luc Jacquet", "studio": "BuenaVistaInternational[us],BonnePiocheT\u00e9l\u00e9vision", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 15, 2008", "box_office": "$77.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["With sparse narration by Morgan Freeman, written by Jordan Roberts, and beauteous orchestrations led by conductor Jeff Schindler, Jacquet lets the magic of the penguins speak for itself.", "Almost painfully straightforward.", "Watch them march to the very extremes of extremis, though, and it's easy to feel awe. Life must beget life, whatever the cost.", "Some of the eggs and chicks freeze, and the parents' cries are painful to hear (probably more for us than for them).", "French director Luc Jacquet and a team of incredibly brave (and heavily bundled) documentary filmmakers captured this complicated mating ritual with strikingly crisp photography that's both grand and intimate.", "A touch David-Attenborough-TV-special in places, but beautifully filmed and dripping with drama, joy and heartbreak.", "The avian protagonists' comical ungainliness on land and deadpan manner make for adorable viewing, while the austere, glacial landscape is consistently breathtaking.", "The love story may be tenuous, but the penguins are undeniably sweet and silly, sliding on their bellies, and the impossibly cute chicks offer up plenty of slapstick.", "With such incredible subject matter, March Of The Penguins cannot help but hold the attention. It's impossible not to warm to the penguins.", "It set the bar high for future documentaries.", "plays like a high-end Discovery Channel special, but it's compelling and beautiful just the same, exuding a love for its subject matter that's infectious", "...a glorious documentary about the remarkable mating cycle of \"emperor\" penguins.", "Did I love it? No. Did I like it? Sure.", "This astonishing film, shot in the Antarctic, captures sights never seen before.", "It's a rather offensively human-centered approach to what should be a mystifying and beautiful experience.", "Birth, death, romance, danger: All play a role in Jacquet's homage to a remarkably endearing creature.", "Though it seems like a somewhat wasted opportunity to shed some light on these creatures, you can't fault Mr. Jacquet for his efforts.", "Director Jacquet has cleverly figured out a way to anthropomorphise his wondrous, web-footed subjects, as they deal with hunger, rejection, loss, loneliness, and sensuality.", "Morgan Freeman's slick voice-over compounds a slightly plodding structure, but the dedication of the penguins -- and the cameramen -- assure your wonderment.", "Director Luc Jacquet captures some remarkable nature shots, getting up close and documenting the entire frigid process, yet the film itself plays like little more than a PBS special."], "rating": ["", "2.5/4", "", "", "", "3/5", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "3/4", "A", "", "", "2/5", "", "2/4", "3.5/4", "", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Debbie Lynn Elias", "Matthew Lucas", "Joe Morgenstern", "J.
