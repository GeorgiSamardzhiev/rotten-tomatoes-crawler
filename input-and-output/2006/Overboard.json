{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Snobbish and wealthy Joanna Stayton (Goldie Hawn) is living a life of leisure with her husband, Grant (Edward Herrmann), when she falls off their yacht and suffers amnesia. Grant takes the opportunity to rid himself of the demanding Joanna -- but Dean (Kurt Russell), a widowed carpenter with four kids who once worked for Joanna, arrives and claims she's his wife. Joanna can't remember her past identity, but has trouble believing that she was ever meant to be a working-class mother of four.", "rating": "44", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 52m", "director": "Garry Marshall", "studio": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 12, 2017", "box_office": "$23.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's fairly commonplace in '80s comedies to design stories that can't end believably, but this setup has a particularly nerve-wracking pace.", "Overboard gives the impression of an all too familiar movie.
