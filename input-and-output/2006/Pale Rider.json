{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When property owner Coy LaHood (Richard Dysart) starts using a band of hooligans to terrorize a group of small-town gold miners into giving up their territory, an enigmatic man named \"Preacher\" (Clint Eastwood) arrives in town.

When the miners, led by Hull Barret (Michael Moriarty), refuse the terms, LaHood sends in Marshall Stockburn (John Russell) to take down Preacher and the others.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Western", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Clint Eastwood", "studio": "TheMalpasoCompany", "theater_date": "Jun 28, 1985", "dvd_date": "Aug 15, 2008", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["For its heart and soul and what it achieves both technically and emotionally, Pale Rider is a film worthy to mark it's makers' ninetieth special day.", "A beautiful, unhurried, snowbound Western punctured by violence and lyricism.", "Though the metaphysical overtones of the screenplay are sometimes awkwardly handled and Eastwood's direction of actors (other than himself) is occasionally uncertain, this was one of the better American films of 1985.", "Pale Rider does nothing to disprove the wisdom that this genre is best left to the revival houses. A double feature of Shane and Eastwood's High Plains Drifter will do just fine, thanks.", "It had been so long since a quality western had hit America's screens that it appears as if Eastwood purposely set out to remind audiences of all the elements that make the genre work.", "It's all been seen before, but Eastwood serves it up with authority, fine craftsmanship and a frequent sense of fun.", "His saddle bag is a mixed one, though Pale Rider still has the touch of quality associated with latter-day Eastwood.
