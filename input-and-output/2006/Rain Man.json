{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When car dealer Charlie Babbitt (Tom Cruise) learns that his estranged father has died, he returns home to Cincinnati, where he discovers that he has an autistic older brother named Raymond (Dustin Hoffman) and that his father's $3 million fortune is being left to the mental institution in which Raymond lives.

And above all it abounds with Dustin Hoffman.", "...wonderful performances make it a memorable trip. Hoffman has by far the juicier role, an opportunity to transform himself almost as radically as he did in Tootsie.", "[A] poignant and involving comedy drama.", "Barry Levinson directs in masterful style It is his best effort in what promises to be a distinguished career.", "Rain Man cheers up its audience but avoids sentimentality. Films like that are rare.", "It's Hoffman's most exposed performance in that he must work almost entirely with his character's landlocked interior life.", "A professionally made, commercial film, no doubt, but its secrets can be uncovered with a second viewing. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Rain Man is a buddy picture with one buddy missing, a road movie without much to see along the way.", "The story may be too black for many looking for a light comedy, or entertainment-escape. But it's a film that's haunting in the way it unravels the love at the core of two brothers who discover each other.", "The best films are those that manage to generate emotion in their audience without ever feeling phony or melodramatic. Rain Man does exactly that.", "Everything about the acting and direction of Rain Man is so exquisitely calibrated and so right that it's all too easy to forget how much could have gone wrong.", "While everyone remembers this film about an autistic man as Dustin Hoffman's Oscar-winning triumph, it is equally Tom Cruise's.", "Under Barry Levinson's astringent direction, Hoffman and Cruise evoke honestly earned emotions. Don't pass on this wonderfully funny and touching movie. There's magic in it.", "When the great screen performances of 1988 are considered for Oscar nomination, expect Hoffman's name on the list.", "A fascinating, often very moving, frequently funny film.", "It's an honorable effort, touched by a certain lightness and grace.", "It has a heart as good as Raymond's own, which is more than a lot of Hollywood movies can say for themselves at the moment.", "powerful and evocative"], "rating": ["8/10", "2/5", "", "", "", "4/4", "", "", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "4/4", "5/5", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Tim Brayton", "Nigel Andrews", "Brian D.
