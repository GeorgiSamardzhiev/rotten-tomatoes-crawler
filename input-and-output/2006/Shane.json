{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Enigmatic gunslinger Shane (Alan Ladd) rides into a small Wyoming town with hopes of quietly settling down as a farmhand. Taking a job on homesteader Joe Starrett's (Van Heflin) farm, Shane is drawn into a battle between the townsfolk and ruthless cattle baron Rufus Ryker (Emile Meyer).

B. Guthrie Jr. have fashioned one of the best of all the Hollywood westerns...", "The simple story, the legendary hero: this is the Western tradition. But in developing his narrative George Stevens employs an unusually sophisticated technique.", "A film that continues to maintain its condition of unscathed classic, although it has its detractors.

But it's more complex than that.", "It is a movie that takes its own measured, deliberate time finding ways to increase your pleasure.", "\"Come back, Shane!\" Classic Western for the ages.", "Western Poetry in Technicolor.", "Despite being burdened with grand pretensions, George Steven's Shane stands securely as one of the most intelligent westerns of its era.", "The direction is deliberate, but the attention to detail is impressive, and the perfromances of Jean Arthur, Alan Ladd, and Brandon De Wilde are so good and restrained that they overcome the social-mythical types they're playing.", "A maravilhosa fotografia que explora as amplas locaes e a fora do elenco j seriam o bastante para criar um timo trabalho.
