{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Following their breakout success in England, flagship punk rock band the Sex Pistols venture out on their first U.S. tour. Temperamental bassist Sid Vicious (Gary Oldman) takes his troubled girlfriend, Nancy Spungen (Chloe Webb), along for the ride. Along the way, the couple's turbulent relationship strains the patience of bandmate Johnny Rotten (Andrew Schofield) and manager Malcolm McLaren (David Hayman), while plunging Sid and Nancy into the depths of drug addiction and co-dependency.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Alex Cox", "studio": "InitialPictures", "theater_date": "Nov 7, 1986", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2006", "box_office": "$2.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This is arguably Cox's finest film. It's arguably one of the United Kingdom's finest.", "Neil Young may have namedropped Johnny Rotten in \"My My, Hey Hey\" but it's Vicious he was really singing about.", "Sid and Nancy is a fascinating record of a volatile period in music history.", "Sid & Nancy is a brutal tour de force.", "There is some nobility in the film's relentlessness and single-minded focus, but not enough to redeem its lack of having anything much to say beyond what we get on the surface.", "Cox doesn't just plot an obvious decline: things do get grim, but he makes you care as you also despair for punk's cracked casualties.", "Even if \"Sid and Nancy\" doesn't quite represent the imperfect perfection in which punk music so often traffics, Alex Cox's confident visual symbolism -combined with Chloe Webb & Gary Oldman's performances -grant it piercing volume and knotty shape.", "Sid and Nancy has some claim on being the finest British film of the 1980s.", "Riveting and repulsive, with a claustrophobic perspective that mirrors its subjects: all id, all in the moment. But it's also shallow, all on the surface.", "At its best Sid & Nancy has a captivating energy and rawness, and there are even some priceless moments of levity.", "They are more than zombies doing needlepoint on each other's veins. Both are brought to life in complex, deeply felt performances from two actors who have abandoned themselves to enormously demanding and difficult roles.", "Repellent is the word for it, but the filmmakers might take that as a compliment, since hardcore sleaze is apparently what tickles them most.", "Every character is booked through to hell or purgatory. But we gasp at the inventiveness, ferocity and cuckoo anarchy with which these rockers prepared their route to destruction or damnation.", "Oldman plays Vicious as awkward, insecure and violent; Webb's Spungen is tantrum-prone yet has a streak of generosity. They both seem very real, though neither will generate much sympathy.", "Sid & Nancy is an honorable try, but it could have been better had Cox found a way to imbue the movie with some of the sheer zaniness of his Repo Man.", "Sid and Nancy is a brilliantly acted surprise from newcomers Gary Oldman and Chloe Webb.", "Once we sense a glimmer of talent and accept these people as human beings, the tragedy of their drug use resonates enormously.", "This is a love story -- an unlikely, perverse, disturbing love story, but a genuine one.", "It's a hard film to watch at times, as Vicious plunges deeper into his heroin-induced slump, but told with skill and compassion, which make up for the onscreen squalor.", "The great DOP Roger Deakins works hard to make cramped, dank interiors look cinematic. Cox's humour, meanwhile, compensates for the grim subject matter."], "rating": ["8/10", "", "3/5", "B+", "2.5/4", "4/5", "3.5/5", "", "3/5", "3/5", "4/4", "", "4/5", "", "", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Grant Watson", "David Harris", "Alexa Dalby", "Nathanael Hood", "James Kendrick", "Kevin Harley", "Nick Rogers", "Ryan Gilbey", "MaryAnn Johanson", "Philip Concannon", "Desmond Ryan", "David Sterritt", "Nigel Andrews", "", "Jay Boyar", "Candice Russell", "Gene Siskel", "Dave Kehr", "Caroline Westbrook", "Tara Brady"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fiction Machine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dog and Wolf", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Audiences Everywhere", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Q Network Film Desk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Yap", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Statesman", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flick Filosopher", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Skinny", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Financial Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Irish Times"], "date": ["January 5, 2021", "September 30, 2019", "February 20, 2019", "December 27, 2018", "September 16, 2017", "January 1, 2017", "November 30, 2016", "September 15, 2016", "August 31, 2016", "August 29, 2016", "August 9, 2016", "August 9, 2016", "August 9, 2016", "August 9, 2016", "August 9, 2016", "August 9, 2016", "August 9, 2016", "August 9, 2016", "August 9, 2016", "August 9, 2016"]}}
