{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This drama is based on the true story of Karen Silkwood (Meryl Streep), who works at a nuclear facility, along with her boyfriend, Drew Stephens (Kurt Russell), and their roommate, Dolly Pelliker (Cher). When Karen becomes concerned about safety practices at the plant, she begins raising awareness of violations that could put workers at risk. Intent on continuing her investigation, Karen discovers a suspicious development: She has been exposed to high levels of radiation.", "rating": "74", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 11m", "director": "Mike Nichols", "studio": "ABCProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 7, 2003", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It has nothing new to tell us. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Despite the recent headlines, there will be many people whose only source of Silkwood's story will be this film. They should receive more than the drama of one rash woman's death, no matter how artistically presented.", "A top notch cast, and a strong, Oscar nominated script by Nora Ephron and Alice Arlen, keep Silkwood  from sliding into cliche 'Lifetime movie of the week' territory.", "It's a thought-provoking film that asks questions about the safety of the nuclear power industry that are still pertinent.", "The film seems... unconvincing when it tries to argue the case of Silkwood's martyrdom, but it soars magnificently when it confines itself to the drama of one woman's courage in renouncing complacency for action.", "Extraordinary portrayals of everyday people characterize the contribution of director Mike Nichols' talented diverse cast. Once again, Nichols justifies his past plaudits for bringing the best out of his players.", "The facts it can lay its hands on do not support a politically alarming or dramatically compelling conclusion to the mysteries of this case. Nor do they lead to a very uplifting statement about the motives and character of its central figure.", "A very fine biographical drama.", "Seemingly better suited for a documentary.", "Gripping.", "", "One of Nichols' best films, Silkwood is effective as factual reportage and portrait of working class life (rare sight in Hollywood cinema), with terrific performances by Meryl Streep, as a new type of American heroine, and Cher, as her lesbian roommate", "Silkwood achieves impressive credentials as a drama of human character, not just as a screed against intolerable public practice.", "Silkwood's \"ordinariness\" protects her from being labelled a wild-eyed Trot, but that should not be allowed to obscure her courage or the whitewash ladled onto her story after her death.", "Silkwood is the story of an ordinary woman, hard-working and passionate, funny and screwed-up, who made those people mad simply because she told the truth as she saw it and did what she thought was right.", "", "Extremely well-acted, powerful story.", "", "Meryl Streep gives the year's most astounding performance by an actress, adding vigor and complexity to almost every scene with her endlessly inventive portrayal of the eccentric heroine. The supporting players skillfully follow her lead.", "Nichols does a superb job of establishing the mood and atmosphere of this small town..."], "rating": ["", "", "2.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "C+", "4/5", "4/5", "A-", "A-", "", "4/4", "3/5", "4/5", "5/5", "", "3/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Diego Gal\u00e1n", "Linda Hirsch", "Matthew Lucas", "Lorien Haynes", "People Staff", "Duane Byrge", "Richard Schickel", "Variety Staff", "Dennis Schwartz", "Cole Smithey", "John A.
