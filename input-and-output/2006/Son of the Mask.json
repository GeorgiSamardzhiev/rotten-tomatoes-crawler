{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A cartoonist and family man, Tim Avery (Jamie Kennedy) lives a peaceful existence with his wife, Tonya (Traylor Howard), as well as their infant son and dog. When the curious canine finds a mask with mystical properties, both dog and baby create chaos with its powers. While Tim and Tonya try to contain the damage, the sly Norse god Loki (Alan Cumming) comes looking for the artifact, resulting in more mishaps that ultimately incur the wrath of the deity's powerful father, Odin (Bob Hoskins).", "rating": "6", "genre": "Comedy/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Lawrence Guterman", "studio": "NewLineCinema,RadarPictures", "theater_date": "Feb 18, 2005", "dvd_date": "Mar 20, 2013", "box_office": "$17.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Dumb and loud, with questionable material.", "Sequels without their original stars are usually sent direct to video.

Did Ben Affleck turn down Son of the Mask?", "Cumming is well-suited to this kind of material, but Kennedy, while decent as a henpecked husband, is unbelievably awful when he dons the green face-paint.", "Retains absolutely none of its predecessor's manic charm.", "Wait till it comes out on video.
