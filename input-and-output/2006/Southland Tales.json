{"metadata": {"synopsis": "With the United States under the threat of nuclear attack, the lives of several people converge in a dystopian Los Angeles.

Meanwhile, Marxist revolutionaries, greedy corporations and secretive government agencies pursue their separate agendas among a paranoid populace.", "rating": "39", "genre": "Comedy/Musical & Performing Arts/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 24m", "director": "Richard Kelly", "studio": "CherryRoadFilmsLLC", "theater_date": "Nov 14, 2007", "dvd_date": "Jan 28, 2015", "box_office": "$273.4K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Southland Tales is dizzyingly maximalist, never happy with one set-piece if it can introduce five.

You're in for the ride to end all rides.", "Southland Tales won't fill everyone's tank with Fluid Karma, but its edgy, slightly demented flavor is entertaining.", "As in Kelly's previous film, Southland's flaws, and its scope, are magnificently earnest; the guy is in way over his head, but his flailing is extravagant.", "As the follow-up to his debut feature, the unexpectedly enduring teen-movie/sci-fi hybrid Donnie Darko, writer-director Richard Kelly has crafted an even more ambitious and far-reaching story", "Writer-director Richard Kelly throws a lot at the wall. The problem, if that's what we should call it, is that everything sticks. That's bad news for those who like some narrative clarity, and great news for those who enjoy bonkers wall art.", "Not much improvement over the vfirst, severely flawed version.", "Dude, I have no idea.", "The brilliance of Southland Tales is inextricable from its flaws, if indeed they are flaws.", "Has the galvanic pulse of a filmmaker trying things out, failing, and trying again", "It's the sort of experience you feel embarrassed about even though you had nothing to do with it, because it's not just a mess, it's a pretentious mess", "This is not just another hodgepodge of a movie that's all noise and excess; writer/ director Richard Kelly has a point here; he has plenty to say.", "The type of incoherent, indulgent muddle that can only emerge from the mind of someone who is quite talented.", "I'll give it this: Southland Tales is never boring.", "entirely misdirected, and the film never gels or even makes sense", "Although it's by any reasonable means a flawed film, Southland Tales demands watching, if only for its cinematic achievements.", "Sets up such a pretense of intellectualism it fools its audience into believing it's on a plane they can't understand...", "A subversive and annihilistic satire on America, lurching from black comedy to farce, from dramatic insight to superficial jokes"], "rating": ["", "3/5", "1.5/4", "", "B-", "", "", "4/5", "C", "1.5/5", "5/5", "", "0.5/4", "7", "1/4", "", "2/5", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Philippa Snow", "Jorge Loser", "Tom Meek", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Julie Washington", "Mark Asch", "Mark Olsen", "Simon Miraudo", "Emanuel Levy", "Dave White", "Rob Gonsalves", "Fernando F.
