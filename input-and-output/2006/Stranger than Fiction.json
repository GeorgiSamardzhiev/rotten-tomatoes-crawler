Thompson in particular hasn't been this inspired for a long time.", "There just isn't enough wit or style or verve to pull it off. It takes a great premise and then not only fails to run with it, but also fails to go absolutely anywhere with it at all.", "\"It's not the best piece of English literature of the last ten years,\" Dustin Hoffman says of Emma Thompson's newest novel, \"but it's not bad.\" That just about sums up Stranger Than Fiction, too.", "Touching dramedy is heavy; won't interest most kids.", "Inventively inverting \"Adaptation.'s'\" anxiety into light romance, \"Fiction\" is one of the most intelligent, lively, charming and beguiling concept comedies since \"Groundhog Day\" and a perfect seriocomic splinter of Will Ferrell's big-baby shtick.", "\"Stranger Than Fiction\" is a sterile and pedantic comedy that tells much more than it shows.", "Suggests how cleverness can suffocate people", "Forster lards over his whimsically feeble film with sentimentality.", "Some of Will Ferrell's biggest fans might find it overly tame and subtle, but it's interesting, enjoyable and a revelation to see he can keep his pants on and still entertain.", "It could have been great. But it's just okay.", "What starts out as a complex, intriguing movie turns stale quickly.", "The actors and the filmmakers all take a more restrained approach than you might expect, keeping the humor gentle, and the jokes mostly as literary as the premise.", "The movie\u00e2(TM)s unforgivable logical flaws and gummy platitudes don\u00e2(TM)t sink it...thanks to Ferrell\u00e2(TM)s fine and humane performance.", "Stranger Than Fiction is not a fluff film. Far from it. Literate and engaging, it may parade around in nonsensical clothes, but just scratch the surface and a vast reservoir of post-modern existentialism is revealed.", "The place where the film runs into problems is in trying to decide, like Harold, as to whether or not it is a comedy or a tragedy. As we know, comedy sells much better and that's the direction the film leans.", "Though there are enough interesting moments to keep it refreshing, Mr. Helm's script never rises above its conceit to reach the giddy Charlie Kaufman heights to which it aspires.", "A literate, literary film with a Hollywood high-concept hitch.", "No es ni una comedia, ni una tragedia, ni una historia de amor, ni una f\u00e1bula.
