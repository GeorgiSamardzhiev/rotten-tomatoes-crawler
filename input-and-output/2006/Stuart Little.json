While George is initially unwelcoming to his new brother, the family cat, Snowbell, is even less enthusiastic about having a mouse as his \"master\" and plots to get rid of him. Against these difficulties, Stuart resolves to face them with as much pluck, love and courage as he can muster. In doing so, he shows his beloved new family that great things can truly come in small packages.", "rating": "67", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Rob Minkoff", "studio": "Franklin/WatermanProd.", "theater_date": "Dec 17, 1999", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$140.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["What's the cutest thing you can imagine?
