{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this adaptation of Tennessee Williams' play, young socialite Catherine Holly (Elizabeth Taylor) is traumatized and committed after witnessing her cousin's violent death on a trip to Europe.

A prodigious work from Katharine Hepburn, Montgomery Clift, and Elizabeth Taylor. This is one of Joseph L. Mankiewicz's best films. [Full Review in Spanish]", "It is hard to know what to say about this misguided tour through the dank recesses of Mr. Williams' subconscious. It's all clearly nonsense, the rankest kind of Victorian melodrama.", "Suddenly, Last Summer remains a remarkably salacious descent into madness, thanks to Mankiewicz's harrowing direction and two towering performances by Taylor and Hepburn", "I found Suddenly, Last Summer hollow, unproductive, unalive, and above all stagey, not cinematic.", "This bizarre and often distasteful movie at the end of the 1950s was an omen of things to come.", "Superbly adapted with blistering performances from Taylor and Hepburn.", "The main trouble with the picture is not its subject or its style, but its length.", "The cast packs enough sexual ambiguity to satisfy the most rabid Williams fan (not to mention a screenplay by Gore Vidal), but Mankiewicz leaves much of the innuendo unexplored -- thankfully, perhaps.", "It has some very effective moments, but on the whole it fails to move.", "A lurid adaptation of the 1957 Tennessee Williams one-act play.", "By Tennessee Williams' standards, the text is trashy and overwroght, but at the time, homosexuality and cannibalism stirred such a controversy that the movie became one of the playwright's most successful Hollywood adaptations.", "On film, with Taylor as the woman who saw something nasty and Clift as the psychiatrist trying to probe her trauma, the one-act material is stretched perilously thin; but it works for Hepburn as the incarnation of civilised depravity.", "", "Very controversial for its time, and still packs a wallop.", "Hepburn and Taylor both earned Oscar nominations for their work; it's hard to pick which turns in a more compelling performance.", "A classic in every sense of the word.", "The main trouble with this picture is that an idea that is good for not much more than a blackout is stretched to exhausting length and, for all its fine cast and big direction, it is badly, pretentiously played.", "Fine version of the story with Hepburn as a fascinating monster.", "The battles between the imperious Hepburn and the presumed-mad Taylor are pure theatricality, while sensitive shrink Clift observes it all and emotes.", "Suddenly, Last Summer (1959) is director Joseph L. Mankiewicz' compelling adaptation by Gore Vidal of Tennessee Williams' 1958 Southern drama-one act play. This lurid, somber, ground-breaking and fascinating melodrama concerned terrible secrets..."], "rating": ["", "", "3.5/4", "", "2.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "", "B", "B", "", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "", "2/5", "4/5", "", "A+"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Augusto Mart\u00ednez Torres", "Dwight MacDonald", "Matthew Lucas", "Isabel Quigly", "", "Kim Newman", "", "Dave Kehr", "Variety Staff", "Dennis Schwartz", "Emanuel Levy", "", "Jake Euker", "Steve Crum", "Christopher Null", "Film4 Staff", "Bosley Crowther", "Ken Hanke", "Marjorie Baumgarten", "Tim Dirks"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Esquire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">From the Front Row", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">F5 (Wichita, KS)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Kansas City Kansan", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmcritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Austin Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmsite"], "date": ["August 8, 2019", "July 12, 2019", "June 4, 2019", "July 19, 2018", "March 23, 2011", "March 23, 2011", "March 23, 2011", "March 23, 2011", "October 18, 2008", "April 7, 2007", "July 26, 2006", "June 24, 2006", "July 17, 2005", "October 15, 2004", "March 21, 2004", "May 24, 2003", "May 20, 2003", "April 2, 2003", "March 10, 2003", "January 1, 2000"]}}
