Check out the video above and see if you agree!", "The film is long. The pace is slow. The mood is solemn. But the action is edge-of-the-seat.", "It is beautifully shot. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The biggest problem with Superman Returns is the script, which bogs down in the love story and forgets the action -- which should be the strong point.", "One blockbuster that actually delivers.", "Overall not a terrible watch but a little bit dry.", "The man doesn't have an ounce of charisma and at best can only be described as an expressionless log of wood. In retrospect, I'd settle for our own delectable Hrithik.", "Would have benefited greatly from Singer trusting his talent and assembling a Superman movie that attempted to soar beyond the heights previously achieved decades ago.", "For all the mountains of kryptonite ranged against him, you never fear for Superman or Lois Lane, never experience anything more intense than the fret of mild peril.", "One of this summer's best action movies.", "The movie runs nearly half an hour longer than it should, with a new plot strand introduced in the third act that has questionable vitality in the presumed sequel.", "Superman Returns is a great kick start to a potentially knockout new franchise, which ultimately leaves the audience, like the people of Metropolis when its greatest hero returns to the skies, brimming with hope.", "More stolid than awe-inspiring", "None of which would register if Routh weren't a Superman whom if we don't need we can at least feel for.", "Underneath its mechanical safety and mild-manners, this movie does have some heart and some muscle. You'll come to like having it around, even if you thought you'd already moved on.", "Superman Returns feels eager to please, and it frequently succeeds, but despite its best intentions, it seldom soars to the height of 1978's Superman: The Movie", "Superman Returns is a bombastic, rousing, explosive burst of summer fun and fantasy, enriched by its predecessors and rejuvenated by the new blood and slavish religious devotion of director Bryan Singer.", "Solid and emotionally direct but not the concussive powerhouse many will be hoping for.", "the tragedy of 9/11 and Lois' super sex with the 'man of steel' are two major selling points of the film, but they remain as sublimated as Clark Kent's secret identity."], "rating": ["", "9/10", "", "", "C+", "3/4", "B-", "2/4", "4/10", "2.5/5", "B-", "", "3/5", "", "3.5/4", "3/5", "", "7/10", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Alex Maidy", "Nikhat Kazmi", "Beatriz Maldivia", "Micheal Compton", "Matthew Lucas", "Rachel Wagner", "Namrata Joshi", "Jeffrey Lyles", "Film4 Staff", "Neil Miller", "Eric Kohn", "Scott Huver", "Fernando F.
