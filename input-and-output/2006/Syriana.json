{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The Middle Eastern oil industry is the backdrop of this tense drama, which weaves together numerous story lines. Bennett Holiday (Jeffrey Wright) is an American lawyer in charge of facilitating a dubious merger of oil companies, while Bryan Woodman (Matt Damon), a Switzerland-based energy analyst, experiences both personal tragedy and opportunity during a visit with Arabian royalty. Meanwhile, veteran CIA agent Bob Barnes (George Clooney) uncovers an assassination plot with unsettling origins.", "rating": "73", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 8m", "director": "Stephen Gaghan", "studio": "WarnerBrothers", "theater_date": "Dec 9, 2005", "dvd_date": "Feb 1, 2009", "box_office": "$50.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A complex thriller that challenges its audience with a fascinating story woven among several plot threads.", "I'm hard-pushed to think of a more cynical and self-critical American picture, and one that so radically and empathetically portrays the genesis of Islamic suicide bombers.", "Syriana is an American movie that reaches out beyond itself. Watching it made me feel hopeful -- a rare sensation in a cinema.", "... If you can avoid getting too hung up on the details, Syriana is a brave attempt to blitz the goody-baddy dynamics of cold-war film-making and concentrate on the ambiguities of modern geopolitics.", "A skeleton of theme minus the meat of resonance", "A film that treats its audience as adults, this is an extremely rewarding work that handsomely pays off the concentration required to watch it.", "This is intelligent, committed, and politically provocative, though its narrative puzzle box may prompt you to throw up your hands and let ExxonMobil go on running the world.", "", "You didn't understand all of it? It went by too fast to take it all in? There was too much information to mentally digest? Yeah, well, that was kind of the point.", "Its dark, dog-eat-dog vision of the world we live in may give you geopolitical nightmares.", "Probes a significant subject but treats its people as mere stick figures carrying exposition from place to place.", "Preferring probing questions to pat solutions, the film drills deep in its exploration of the US's ventures, both economic and military, in the Middle East.", "The most troublesome part of Syriana is that the movie is, in fact, so easy to believe.", "Gaghan kapitulira pred holivudskim konvencijama te film zaklju%u010Duje spektakularnom, ali banalnom i krajnje neuvjerljivom zavr%u0161nicom", "Politically-paranoid, if well-intentioned, this disjointed message movie doesn't really do much more than indict the usual suspects.", "In addition to the performances there's a wealth of memorable detail.", "This is neither realism nor tragedy. It's cynicism, which exposes itself most nakedly in Damon's addresses to the Arab characters, and in Gaghan's own portrayal of them.", "Interesting and worth watching, despite the fact that complete comprehension of the film seems just beyond the reach of the viewer.", "It's entirely possible that Gaghan just isn't an actor's director.", "The disorientation is purely cosmetic."], "rating": ["A", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "7/10", "", "3/5", "4/5", "3/4", "4/10", "2/4", "", "", "3/4", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Micheal Compton", "PJ Nabarro", "Zadie Smith", "Victoria Segal", "Fernando F.
