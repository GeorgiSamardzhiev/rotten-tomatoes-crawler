For you, this will be so much more than a fun, fashion-conscious comedy. It will be therapy.", "The film ultimately fails because it lacks the sharpness needed to make a successful satire. Who would have thought that a comedy about models could suffer from being too nice?", "It's Meryl's movie, everyone says, and in a way it is. She gives a furiously funny performance as a furiously nasty bit of work... But, as I said earlier, scenes without her suffer horribly.", "There isn't anything unexpected here; it's the usual clich\u00e9s: women are nasty cows who blithely undercut each other for jobs, and men are largely irrelevant to the process. . .", "We continue to reflect on the movie's lessons long after the laughs have diminished because they are sound, relevant and conveyed by the talents of actors who offer legitimate stakes in the material.", "", "Nimbly assembled and tartly performed", "An ironic measure of the film's research into the fashion-mag scene is the fact that there's almost no journalism in it.", "Just another formula mediocre dramedy...", "", "There are some must-have luxuries here, first of which is Meryl Streep's fascinating performance as the fearsome Miranda Priestly.", "An agreeably shallow comedy.", "The Devil Wears Prada isn't a brilliant film, but it certainly is an entertaining one.", "An ideal movie for DVD: you can pick and choose moments and lines to revisit while ignoring, or trying to ignore, the thematic compromises, hectoring impulses, and structural handicaps that start to engulf the film.", "Streep is a far better reason to see The Devil Wears Prada than the movie itself.", "It's to the film's credit that I still found it an enjoyable satire, as glossy and superficial as the industry it purports to skewer.", "The story itself falls too frequently into the standard cliches of the awkward-girl-turns-into-a-swan-thanks-to-an-unexpected-fairy-godmother formula.", "Funciona por el talento de sus actrices, por lo inteligente de su gui\u00f3n y por no pretender ser nada fuera de lo com\u00fan.
