Period.", "Without a doubt, one of the best films of all time. As far as crime drama/mobster genre goes, it starts and ends with this masterpiece. Period. [Full review in Spanish]", "Leaves you confused and dirty, yet fulfilled and satisfied, kind of like having great sex with someone you definitely shouldn't sleep with.", "For those who have already witnessed the rise and fall of the Corleone family, which mirrors the trajectory of the American dream, now is as good a time as ever to revisit. For those who haven't seen Coppola's mafia movies: brace yourselves.", "The Godfather is the most substantial and satisfying of all the mass entertainment films to come out of Hollywood in recent years.", "A consistent work that sporadically makes palpable the talent of Francis Ford Coppola. [Full Review in Spanish]", "If ever there was a great example of how the best popular movies come out of a merger of commerce and art, \"The Godfather\" is it.", "Casting in these roles has been exceptional, particularly with Ai Pacino, a relative new comer as Michael.

One comes to understand, even to condone, the activities of the Godfather and his clan.", "It is a long (three hours), often exciting and always well-directed film about the struggle for survival of one of the five Mafia 'families,' the Corleones, in late 1940s New York.", "Brando is the strong magnet that will draw fans to The Godfather. But behind-the-scenes creativity is of equal value to this film of towering proportions.", "I don't see how any gifted actor could have done less than Brando does here. His resident power, his sheer innate force, has rarely seemed weaker.", "... its amber antique look, its misty-eyed, soft-hearted vision of honorable men battling for their shot at the American main chance as much a part of our collective iconography as ...
