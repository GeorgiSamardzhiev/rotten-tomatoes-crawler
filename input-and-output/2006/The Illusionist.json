{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Magic tricks can't compete with rock 'n' roll in the 1950s, so a French illusionist (Jean-Claude Donda) finds himself touring Scotland's shabby pubs and run-down restaurants. But things brighten for him when he meets Alice (Eilidh Rankin), a girl who believes his powers are real. Together they travel to Edinburgh for a performance, but he doesn't have the heart to reveal that his feats are merely tricks, and risks financial ruin by giving her gifts supplied by his \"magic.\"", "rating": "90", "genre": "Animation/Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Sylvain Chomet", "studio": "DjangoFilms,France3Cin\u00e9ma,CineB", "theater_date": "Dec 25, 2010", "dvd_date": "Jan 14, 2014", "box_office": "$2.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["While I've heard nothing yet about Chomet's next film, I can wholeheartedly say L'illusionniste had made my interest disappear.", "Perfectly combines the unique visual style of Oscar-nominated animator Sylvain Chomet with the melancholy, simple, and poignant storytelling approach of Jacques Tati.", "The Illusionist changed me in ways big and small and I am better for having seen it.", "Sweet but with a melancholic edge, if it is occasionally too slight, too circumscribed, or too molasses-paced for its own good, it's a minor quibble next to The Illusionist's overarching charm.", "The film's animation tells the story, in the manner of a beautifully-illustrated children's storybook.", "You're basically just watching each day of this guy's life, and yet, it's totally magical. Tati's script is full of beauty, humor and sadness, with a very European ending that will leave the viewer a little misty eyed.", "Chomet has delivered yet another fantastically assured film, one which even transcends the brilliance of his first feature.", "The Illusionist feels personal, with a deep melancholy that keeps the story from becoming overly sentimental or cutesy.", "Consider director Sylvain Chomet...the ringmaster and main attraction in this melancholic circus accented by a warm, water-colored Edinburg landscape.", "The film is best thought of as a fond homage to Tati from a sympathetic admirer rather than a literal attempt at realising his intentions ... In this it succeeds exquisitely.", "The Illusionist is as radiantly rich as Tati's own movies, without losing any sense of period.", "It is elegiac, charming, mournful and wondrous.", "For his next astonishing feat, that wizard of the animated screen Sylvain Chomet, master of The Triplets of Belleville, has pulled out of his hat an all-new Jacques Tati film.", "An 80-minute, hand-drawn animated French film without dialogue and with one of the most depressing finale acts ever committed to celluloid: this is The Illusionist. It's also some sort of divine masterpiece.", "There's plenty of crack-a-smile humor, but the underlying mood recalls the diminuendo stretches in a Jacques Tati film.", "Pictures speak louder than words, and what 'The Illusionist' speaks loudest about is the notion that what we do for a living is not nearly as important as how we choose to do our living.", "Hand drawn animation that is as soft and charming as the film itself.", "Director Sylvain Chomet manages to rouse a lot of smirks and smiles through the small nuance and inferences that were Tati's signature.", "Whilst they hardly say a word, I felt much sorrow for these two lonely characters and the changing world in which they find themselves.", "Funny, sweet, nostalgic and ultimately heartbreaking."], "rating": ["", "1", "3.5/4", "", "4/4", "", "5/5", "3.5", "B+", "", "", "", "", "", "", "A", "3/4", "3/5", "A-", "4/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Deb Jannerson", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Felicia Feaster", "Sarah Knight Adamson", "Amie Simon", "Stephen Leach", "Brandy McDonnell", "Kiko Martinez", "Lynden Barber", "David Cairns", "Dorothy Woodend", "Stuart Klawans", "Glenn Dunks", "Nicolas Rapold", "Al Alexander", "Roger Moore", "Jim Schembri", "Matthew Toomey", "Thomas Caldwell"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bitch Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Charleston City Paper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sarah&#39;s Backstage Pass", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Three Imaginary Girls", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Oklahoman", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Antonio Current", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Limelight", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MUBI", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Tyee (British Columbia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Nation", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Trespass", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Comment Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Patriot Ledger", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Nation", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Age (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ABC Radio Brisbane", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Autopsy"], "date": ["January 7, 2021", "November 30, 2020", "September 11, 2020", "January 21, 2020", "January 16, 2020", "March 7, 2019", "November 5, 2018", "August 13, 2018", "January 29, 2018", "January 3, 2018", "December 14, 2017", "August 22, 2017", "February 23, 2016", "September 15, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "May 26, 2013", "January 27, 2013", "October 18, 2011", "August 28, 2011", "August 17, 2011"]}}
