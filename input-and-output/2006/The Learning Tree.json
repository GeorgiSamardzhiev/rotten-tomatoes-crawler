But when Marcus' father, Booker (Richard Ward), murders a man -- and Newt witnesses the crime -- Newt realizes that going to the police could jeopardize both his friendship and his life.", "rating": "69", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Gordon Parks", "studio": "Winger", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Does the film as a whole make it?
