{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Set in postwar Vienna, Austria, \"The Third Man\" stars Joseph Cotten as Holly Martins, a writer of pulp Westerns, who arrives penniless as a guest of his childhood chum Harry Lime (Orson Welles), only to find him dead. Martins develops a conspiracy theory after learning of a \"third man\" present at the time of Harry's death, running into interference from British officer Maj. Calloway (Trevor Howard) and falling head-over-heels for Harry's grief-stricken lover, Anna (Alida Valli).", "rating": "99", "genre": "Classics/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Carol Reed", "studio": "BritishLionFilmCorporation,LondonFilmProduction", "theater_date": "Feb 1, 1949", "dvd_date": "Sep 5, 2016", "box_office": "$447.0K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["As a mystery, it is average - but as a darkly artistic approach to intrigue, it's masterful.", "The writing, the acting, the music, and the locations are so distinct and recognizable that they have become lodged in our consciousness.", "Seventy years on such sombreness seems timely, as does Harry Lime, Welles's deliciously elusive antihero.", "The astounding acting bit, it may turn out, is that contributed by Orson Welles. As the object of this chilling search, Welles for once is pulled back to the size of a gifted actor, a trick for which he and a lot of old Welles' admirers can thank Reed.", "The music is as distinctive as the James Bond or Star Wars theme...", "This film is lively, always moving forward, constantly bubbling with mystery and suspicion and secrets, but the characters are always driving the film.", "We're seduced out of caring for Greene's weary plot. Welles saves the film and destroys it.", "Krasker's camera reveals a dank, matte, defeated city - so dully vivid as to be a character unto itself - except that this Vienna becomes something altogether different seen at night or underground.", "By the very nature of its settings and story, there are occasional reminiscences of Lang and Hitchcock, but there is nothing borrowed or imitated. Stylistically, The Third Man is Reed's most impressive film.", "Welles was a still-ridiculously young 34 when he played Harry, but he was probably born sounding 56...", "The bombed buildings, piles of rubble and their evocative shadows form a haunting backdrop to the outdoor scenes, particularly at night. ... Greene's talent for dialogue and suspense shine. [It] has more twists and turns than a rollercoaster.", "It's an exciting experience, dazzling and entertaining and thought-provoking.", "Reed and screenwriter Graham Greene let the story unfold slowly and deliberately, like the cigarette smoke that floats around the characters, and keep us guessing at every step.", "Like many, I have loved this thriller of conscience and betrayal most of my moviegoing life.", "What really makes the film sing, though, isn't the jaunty and iconic zither score by Anton Karas. It's the film's groundbreaking visual aesthetic, which combines noir tropes with expressionism to create a visual wonderland of living shadows.", "This is a film which does away with such cretinous inanity as offering up goodies and baddies, instead presenting its cast of characters as doing things which they believe to be good, but are not seen as such through the eyes of observers.", "\"The Third Man\" is important not just because of its technique but because of its theme ...", "Few films more effectively capture the crumbling infrastructure and opportunistic lawlessness of postwar Europe. And none better translate the snaking treachery of Graham Greene's stories and his worlds of cynical expats and casual betrayal.", "Set in postwar occupied Vienna, the plot is a corker, littered with memorable moments and played to perfection by an unforgettable cast that's led with distinction by Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten.", "Best read not as an homage to Hitchcock - or to special super secret guest star Orson Welles - than as a study of what Carol Reed biographer Robert F. Moss describes as 'the ineffectuality of goodness.'"], "rating": ["1", "", "5/5", "", "", "", "", "4/4", "", "5/5", "", "A", "4/4", "4/4", "A", "5/5", "", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Allen Almachar", "Ed Potton", "Jay Carmody", "Lisa Nesselson", "Sean Axmaker", "Quentin Curtis", "Mark Feeney", "MFB Critics", "Rob Gonsalves", "Emily S.
