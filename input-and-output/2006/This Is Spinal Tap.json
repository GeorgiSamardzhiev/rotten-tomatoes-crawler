{"metadata": {"synopsis": "\"This Is Spinal Tap\" shines a light on the self-contained universe of a metal band struggling to get back on the charts, including everything from its complicated history of ups and downs, gold albums, name changes and undersold concert dates, along with the full host of requisite groupies, promoters, hangers-on and historians, sessions, release events and those special behind-the-scenes moments that keep it all real.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 22m", "director": "Rob Reiner", "studio": "SpinalTapProd.", "theater_date": "Sep 8, 1984", "dvd_date": "Aug 3, 2016", "box_office": "$188.8K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Little riffs of comic genius can be heard amidst the heavy-metal cacophony of This is Spinal Tap...", "Documenting the licks and antics of a real band is one thing. Building a movie around a fake one is a challenge of a different order. The key, as Spinal Tap proved, is to fabricate a band that looks, acts and sounds at least as good as the real thing.", "This is Spinal Tap is hilarious to everyone who's not a musician. Because as ridiculous and perverse as Rob Reiner's heavy metal mockumentary gets, the slim, 82-minute comedy gnaws at more truths than any other rock 'n' roll biopic put to celluloid.", "Reiner, with McKean, Guest and Harry Shearer, have done a great job in creating and portraying characters that are dimwitted, cliched and yet oddly endearing.", "Yes Nigel, you did go to 11. Where would cinematic comedy be if you hadn't?", "Consistently funny, with sheer brilliant turns from every performer on the cast...", "Returning to Spinal Tap always brings with it a pronounced sense of discovery, a freshness that is uncommon with movies generally and unspeakably rare in a comedy.", "[VIDEO] Although examples of the mockumentary genre existed before \"Spinal Tap\" this heavy metal comedy is considered an epitome of cinematic satire.", "If you didn't know this was a fake film, you could easily believe it's real.", "...a sporadically amusing but all-too-uneven piece of work...", "Hilarious, ribald, drug-filled rock send-up.", "The original suffers upon review simply because its novelty has worn off. But being the first mainstream feature of its kind, it deserves due reverence.", "The story of an embarrasingly inept heavy-metal band called Spinal Tap, Rob Reiner's film set the mockumentary standard that has come to define much of modern screen comedy. [Blu-ray]", "For music biz insiders, This Is Spinal Tap is a vastly amusing satire of heavy metal bands.", "Scores an 11 (out of 10) for sheer inspired lunacy but it's the writers' unexpected fondness for their subject matter that puts the film in a class all its own.", "For all its japes and jokes, the movie is really about exhaustion of the spirit: sitting in a bleak hotel suite at 4 a.m. with the bad taste of last night in the mouth and the feeling that tomorrow will not be a better day.", "Hilarious, bitingly perceptive and cinematically assured.", "Mildly funny, not a whole lot better than the best Christopher Guest mockumentary I'd seen before this, 'Best in Show.'", "There had been countless documentary spoofs before This Is Spinal Tap, but this inspired put-on was the first to actually capture the texture and style of real documentary.", "Hilarious pseudo-documentary spoof of a British rock group that was so on-target in its satire, many viewers took it for the real thing."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "", "A", "", "A+", "", "9/10", "A+", "5/5", "2/4", "4/5", "2.5/4", "4/4", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "B", "", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Josh Larsen", "Brian D.
