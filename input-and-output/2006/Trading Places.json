{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Upper-crust executive Louis Winthorpe III (Dan Aykroyd) and down-and-out hustler Billy Ray Valentine (Eddie Murphy) are the subjects of a bet by successful brokers Mortimer (Don Ameche) and Randolph Duke (Ralph Bellamy).

When Winthorpe and Valentine uncover the scheme, they set out to turn the tables on the Dukes.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "John Landis", "studio": "CinemaGroupVentures,ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 6, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Since 48 hrs. had yet to be released, Landis and the studio took a big risk casting Murphy, fortunately, the gamble (pun intended) paid off.", "The two stars (especially Murphy) are terrific, and the supporting cast provides additional flavor.", "...Trading Places is still funny with thanks to Dan Aykroyd and Eddie Murphy but some of the film's racial aspects are problematic in this era.", "Juxtaposing iconic architecture and historic statues with this heavily loaded satire examining the intersection of race and class situate Trading Places firmly in its American context.", "Trading Places is an excellent comedy -- a bit cold and cerebral, but well-constructed and organized. [Full Review in Spanish]", "What really resonates about this comedy, some 30 years after its release, is how it was able to intuitively crystallise the whole socio-political landscape of the era.", "Landis' direction is deft, but the sparkling performances are the real draw not only by Murphy and Aykroyd but also by Don Ameche and Ralph Bellamy as the meddling oldsters, Denholm Elliott as the gentlemanly servant and Jamie Lee Curtis.", "Trading Places is a comedy of unavoidable fits and starts.", "This blatant, unacknowledged reworking of The Prince and the Pauper is a rattling comedy showcase for the unique talents of Eddie Murphy and Dan Aykroyd, who have seldom recaptured the form they show here.", "While the two-hour running time overstretches the material, there are plenty of laughs -- as well as sly digs at the racism and greed of the American establishment.", "Directed by John Landis with a surprising amount of class, though he lets some of his old Animal House' vulgarity slip ostentatiously into the action.", "It's all outrageously contrived, and only surprising restraint by director John Landis makes it work. The writing is superb, too, leaving the two funnymen free to do the most inspired textured portrayals either has managed in movies.", "Edgy, bawdy '80s comedy not meant for kids.", "...a fun-filled film all the way around.", "Preposterous lighthearted one-joke comedy.", "...one of the most impressive comedies to emerge out of the 1980s.", "Fast-paced and energetic social satire fleshed out with lots of enjoyable silliness.", "The Saturday Night Live veterans Murphy and Ackroyd are the show-stealers here in this decent family comedy.", "Trading Places also makes Eddie Murphy a force to be reckoned with.", "This 1983 film re-creates a screwball comedy format and then eliminates everything but the crudest audience-gratification elements; any incursions into the more morally complicated side of the genre are quickly curtailed."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "3/4", "4/5", "5/5", "", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "7/10", "C+", "3/4", "4/5", "4/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Allison Rose", "Matt Brunson", "Danielle Solzman", "Sez\u00edn Koehler", "Octavi Marti", "PJ Nabarro", "Yardena Arar", "Gary Arnold", "David Parkinson", "", "David Sterritt", "Ralph Novak", "Alex Orner", "John J.
