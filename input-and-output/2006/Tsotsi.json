{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A South African hoodlum named Tsotsi (Presley Chweneyagae) lives by a code of violence, and he and his gang of thugs prowl the streets of Johannesburg day and night, attacking those who fail to give them what they want. After casually shooting a woman and stealing her car, he discovers her baby in the back seat. Instead of harming the mewling infant, he takes it home and cares for it. The child acts as a catalyst for the hardened thug to regain his humanity.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 31m", "director": "Gavin Hood", "studio": "MovieWorld,NationalFilmandVideoFoundationofSA,UKFilmandTVProductionCo.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 8, 2016", "box_office": "$2.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It is one of only a handful of films where I have, quite literally, forgotten that it is a foreign film.", "Artfully combining and complimenting with each other the story and technical aspects of the film, the results are an unparalleled synergistic relationship, seamlessly interweaving the film's ever increasing message of hope and redemption.", "The audience gasps in that odd mixture of surprise and recognition that great story-telling affords.", "It's a redemption song that could be stripped down into a Hallmark-esque distillation of \"City of God.\" Instead, it retains a minor key, with bullets, blood and beatings illustrating a descent into dangerous living while a baby's presence suggests hope.", "Fraudulent, patronizing, and empty", "Gavin Hood's Oscar-nominated tale about a young South African gangster who gets an unexpected chance at redemption is literally a world apart from anything produced by Hollywood.", "...an emotionally honest tale of redemption that does not ignore the fact that we live in a world of cause and consequence.", "The Johannesburg equivalent of any stateside gangster fairy tale, Tsotsi actually feels even more forced than Hollywood's modern urban dramas.", "Memorable, with a terrific performance by Presley Chweneyagae as Tsotsi that burns in its contained rage.", "Don't be fooled by the subtitles and the egg head accolades. This pretentious mess is just another country's version of 50 Cent-style fare.", "Un drama urbano duro y conmovedor, si bien algo previsible, con un estupendo protagonista. Una pelcula realmente atendible que nos acerca al infrecuente cine sudafricano.", "This powerful story, reminiscent of Dostoyevsky's 'Crime and Punishment,' is told with a minimum of dialogue.", "This film won the Oscar for best foreign language film, and it is well deserved.", "told with conviction and skill, and Chweneyagae's expressive face and eyes reveal all the emotions, fears and hopes that Tsotsi cannot articulate.", "In the long run, the film may not entirely satisfy one's intellectual curiosity, but it pleases the heart.", "A chance for the stay-at-home world-travelers to catch sight of Johannesburg's filthy sprawling township of Soweto.", "It's well-acted, beautifully photographed and meticulously professional.", "Tsotsi remains at all times an intensely human story, one that transcends the particulars of its time and its place.", "A film of extraordinary viciousness and vulnerability about a criminal who has to meet an infant to remember he is still a child himself.", "Without cheap deceptions, clever editing, plot conveniences or overt exposition, the film pulls you in and keeps you there on the merit of the story's substance."], "rating": ["4.0/4", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "8/10", "2/5", "B+", "1/4", "3/5", "A", "4/5", "3/4", "7/10", "C+", "3/5", "4/5", "3.5/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Zadie Smith", "Nick Rogers", "Fernando F.
