[Full Review in Spanish]", "Small and subdued, yet at the same time epic in scale. Shyamalan tells the story of superheroes, but in a contained and human fashion.", "I was never really bored and it's a pretty creative twist on the comic book genre. Unfortunately I appreciate it more for the potential than the end result.", "I refuse to call this masterpiece a superhero film because I cannot compare it formula based films that work under big studio standards. [Full review in Spanish].", "\"Unbreakable\" is likely to stand the test of time as long as stories about superheroes - or heroes in general - are still sought by scared, suffering human beings.", "(It won't) appeal to all... (but) for those interested in understanding the psychology of what makes heroes and villains tick, there are few films I could recommend higher.", "By watching this masterpiece, you'll realize that not all movies of this genre need to be driven mostly by action spectacle and one-liners.", "This compelling conundrum of a film marks the maturity of Sixth Sense director M Night Shyamalan as a distinctive, even remarkable filmmaker.", "I think Unbreakable might just be his [M. Knight Shyamalan's] masterpiece -- a movie that was truly ahead of its time.", "Writer/director M. Night Shyamalan's penchant for a deliberate narrative is certainly in full effect with Unbreakable...", "", "Interesting premise, but ultimately disappointing.", "Sequel talk often sparks because this unconventionally contemplative comic-book film is M. Night Shyamalan's only idea worth continuing -a patient, downbeat and thrillingly unpredictable drama that still stands today as Shyamalan's visionary masterpiece.", "A superhero origin story for an audience that appreciates human stories...", "", "With all these superlatives, how could Shyamalan so badly misjudge vital elements to the story? The melodramatic elements take away substantially from much of what could otherwise be hailed as a masterpiece.", "The characters (especially Willis') are drab and uninteresting, and the story, even allowing for the supernatural overtones, is unconvincing."], "rating": ["4/10", "3.0/4", "", "", "5/5", "C+", "4/4", "4/4", "9.5/10", "", "", "", "3/4", "B-", "2/5", "4/4", "3.5/4", "4/5", "", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "A.S.
