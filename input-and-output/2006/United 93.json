[Full Review in Spanish]", "An exquisite and respectful masterpiece that resonates with power, intensity and raw emotion, making it 2006's best film.", "A well-crafted and respectful film. If only it had gone one step further in driving that point home.", "The film pulls you into its world, turns you a passive participant. You can feel the desperation of the passengers and as they run to the cockpit...", "What might be therapeutic for the families is not perhaps meant for public consumption. After all, few things are more private than the last minutes of a life.", "All that United 93 can tell us. . .is that many people are brave and some people are dastardly.", "It's a difficult and upsetting experience but a worthwhile one, which will linger in your mind long after the film ends.", "Above all, one truth remains: the sacrifice of the 40 passengers on Flight 93 is truly remarkable. The film portrays their courage in the face of staggering odds in its own subjective and respectful way. It achieves what it wants as a film.", "A black hole", "A flawed, but gripping well-crafted piece of drama...", "This is not a film you go to for enjoyment, but because you have a duty to endure it.", "This is first-rate, visceral filmmaking: taut, watchful, free of false histrionics, as observant of the fear in the young terrorists' eyes as the hysteria in the passenger cabin, and smart enough to know this material doesn't need to be sensationalized.", "a real-time reconstruction of events on the doomed flight that manages to encapsulate all the anxieties and sorrows of our age.", "I can say that United 93 has been done well -- with intelligence, compassion, efficiency -- and yet still question whether it was worth doing.", "", "A supreme achievement.", "Amazingly detailed in its narrative cohesion and editing, United 93 is a noble tribute to the tragedy of 9/11.", "Greengrass recreates the attacks on the World Trade Center utilizing existing news footage and it still retains the horror of that day. Despite knowing the ultimate outcome of this film, UNITED 93 is a harrowing and important film.", "Cinema verite at its very best!"], "rating": ["4/4", "", "A", "3/4", "3/4", "", "", "4/4", "", "", "", "1", "", "5/5", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "4/4", "A-", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Matt Brunson", "Alberto Abu\u00edn", "Micheal Compton", "Matthew Lucas", "Namrata Joshi", "Victoria Segal", "Daniel Mendelsohn", "Hannah Brown", "James Hughes", "Fernando F.
