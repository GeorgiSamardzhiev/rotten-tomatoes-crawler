It's a ghost story that won't give you the chills. And most importantly of all, it's yet another fine movie from Spanish master Pedro Almodovar.", "The film never minces its words, it unabashedly confronts the challenges women everywhere face.", "Almod\u00f3var's tribute to mother love is overflowing with the anguish and ecstasy of life.", "The film is, almost by definition, deeper, more intelligent, more nuanced and more beautifully filmed than at least 95 percent of the movies coming out of Hollywood - if not more.", "Volver disappoints.", "Beautiful performances, a refreshing story, and spot-on comedic timing make this a wonderful movie.", "This is a woman's picture in the best sense of the term, anchored by bravura turns from Penelope Cruz and Carmen Maura. Something of a departure for the Spanish auteur, it also seals his status as a cinematic master. Never that this was much in doubt.", "Almod\u00f3var himself once again returning, with delicious self-consciousness, to an old plot. . . and reconfiguring it, as he does here even more radically than in his other recent films, in the subtle but provocative manner of his mature style.", "Almod\u00f3var's maturity navigates not only the thin lines between comedy and drama and between body and spirit, but also between rebellion and acceptance", "It's up to charm to twinkle our attention away from the loose threads and daytime TV plotting.", "", "At the center of this hectic universe, [Cruz] never misses a step and may even elevate what Almodovar originally conceived.", "With all its unexpected twists and turns, the story still unfolds naturally, like some gaudy Mediterranean flower.", "Pedro Almodovar's Volver is amazingly bright, fresh and clean for a film dealing with murder, adultery, incest, malignant disease and the occasional supernatural apparition.", "", "Hollywood, take notice: If you hand Penelope Cruz a role with more depth than the paper it's printed on, this is what you'll get.", "", "Until now, you may not have considered Penelope Cruz the modern-day successor to Barbara Stanwyck and Joan Crawford. But director Pedro Almodovar's delightful 'Volver' could change your mind.", "...a knowing treatise on the currents that run between mothers and daughters."], "rating": ["", "3.5/5", "", "", "", "", "A", "", "", "", "B-", "3/5", "4.5/5", "", "8/10", "4/4", "4/4", "4.5/5", "4.5/5", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Alyx Vesey", "Leigh Paatsch", "Ruhaan Shah", "Felicia Feaster", "Remezcla Team", "Stanley Kauffmann", "Candice Frederick", "Dorothy Woodend", "Daniel Mendelsohn", "Fernando F.
