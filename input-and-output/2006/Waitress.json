{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Jenna (Keri Russell) works in a diner in a small Southern town and is a genius at creating luscious desserts, but her marriage to an overbearing lout (Jeremy Sisto) makes happiness impossible. When she discovers she is pregnant, she makes plans to skip town before her condition is obvious. However, she begins an affair with the new town doctor (Nathan Fillion), who is the only one who knows her secret.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Adrienne Shelly", "studio": "Night&amp;DayPictures", "theater_date": "May 2, 2007", "dvd_date": "Jul 12, 2014", "box_office": "$19.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's hard to picture an actress other than Russell so beautifully blending the drama, desperation, hopefulness, sweetness, and sensuality of her character.", "Adrienne Shelly's 'Waitress' is a bittersweet comedy-drama that has good intentions when it establish its romantic dilemmas, but I feel it lacks grace and emotionality. [Full review in Spanish]", "The experience is enjoyable but bittersweet, because Waitress will leave you with a taste for more.", "This little movie's got a lot of heart, and it's a heart that's unafraid to embrace life's littlest moments in all its forms.", "...genuinely, genially funny and carries a modestly affirming moral: You have to make yourself happy and you have to be able to live with yourself.", "Shelly deftly achieves a tone pitched between fantasy and reality, its levity belying an astute and humane study of an unhappy relationship steeped in inertia.", "Funny, gentle, unpatronising, if occasionally naive and quirky.", "Essentially a king-size serving of sitcom", "Adrienne Shelly's lasting legacy is this exquisite, engaging film about slices of life, Keri Russell's luminosity, an unhurried narrative, Andy Griffith's codger delighting in schadenfreude and even Jeremy Sisto making his abhorrent character relatable.", "Allergic as I am to quirkiness, I was won over", "... Fillion offers up an endlessly charismatic performance...", "The film is hardly flawless - even the pie-baking scenes sometimes seem half-baked - but it's hard not to read promise into every frame, and to wonder what Shelly might have cooked up in the future.", "Adrienne Shelly's last piece has all the right ingredients.", "full of whiney characters that eventually make the right decisions only after an unprecedented amount of hand-wringing", "It's a love letter of the first degree, the kind that rises out of trepidation and confusion, almost by accident, with a sudden force of absolute clarity.", "Waitress is a beautiful and poignant swan song for what should have been the vanguard of a blossoming career.", "Keri Russell sparkles in this story about a piemaker who longs for something more filling.", "Waitress combines quirky humour with an added and enhanced sense of emotional truth.", "Completely inauthentic in every detail--the cinematic equivalent of an apple pie from Perkins.", "Despite Shelly's twist of disturbing fate, WAITRESS will be a memorialized nod of a little gem of a film that delivered a slice of pie to our hungry, entertaining expectations"], "rating": ["4.0/4", "6/10", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "3/5", "1/5", "3.5/4", "", "2.5/4", "", "8/10", "2/5", "4/5", "8/10", "3.5/4", "", "2/10", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Yasser Medina", "Brandy McDonnell", "Jade Budowski", "Sean Axmaker", "Shauna Lyon", "Wally Hammond", "Cliff Doerksen", "Nick Rogers", "Fernando F.
