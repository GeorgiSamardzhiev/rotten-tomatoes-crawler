{"metadata": {"synopsis": "On the Wall Street of the 1980s, Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) is a stockbroker full of ambition, doing whatever he can to make his way to the top. Admiring the power of the unsparing corporate raider Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), Fox entices Gekko into mentoring him by providing insider trading. As Fox becomes embroiled in greed and underhanded schemes, his decisions eventually threaten the livelihood of his scrupulous father (Martin Sheen). Faced with this dilemma, Fox questions his loyalties.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 5m", "director": "Oliver Stone", "studio": "20thCenturyFox", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$41.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Douglas steals the show as the rich guy viewers love to hate.", "Much is made of Douglas' superbly sleazy display here, but the heart of the film is Charlie Sheen's anchoring effort as the stock market ingenue getting a crash course in cornering other people's cash.", "A lavish misstep in the straight career of this filmmaker. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The film benefits enormously from shrewd casting.", "Oliver Stone's Wall Street is exactly what I had hoped for -- a sensationally entertaining melodrama about greed and corruption in New York, a movie that evokes the power of big money so strongly that you can savor it on your tongue like Stilton and port.", "Michael Douglas has a splendid part here, and tackles it with relish.", "The conflict may be familiar, but Stone brings the mystery of Wall Street's heros and villains, its big-stakes players and two-bit salesmen into sharp focus. It's a look that is both exhilarating and astounding.", "...an eye-opening behind-the-scenes glimpse at an almost alien landscape.", "For a motion picture that, at the time of shooting, was intended to be relatively hip and cutting-edge, it is now so laughably outdated it almost feels like science-fiction.", "Like the rest of Stone's oeuvre, it's about as subtle as a sledgehammer. But his filmmaking style is like heavy metal: When he hits the right chords, nobody plays with as much power or brash energy.", "Some of the 1980s-era details may seem a bit dated, and the movie's attitude toward women is slightly despicable, but the overall story arc, echoing the \"Faust\" tale, is timeless.", "...blustery and unsophisticated, like many of the movies of Oliver Stone.", "All the performances are excellent with the emotional highlights including the father/son emotional angst between Sheen and his real life father Martin Sheen.", "", "", "It's solid, but no showcase for HD.", "a compelling drama that is exceedingly well acted (with the obvious exception of the wretched Daryl Hannah)", "A big, glossy movie that satirises the whole yuppie ethos more than anything else.", "The sensibility of this movie is so adolescent that it's hard to take it as seriously as the filmmakers intend us to.", "Writer-director Oliver Stone, who shows an uncanny knack for anticipating public interest in the subjects he chooses, explores the much-publicized inside trading scandals of the mid-1980s."], "rating": ["6/10", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "2/4", "4.5/5", "3/5", "2/4", "", "5/5", "2/5", "7/10", "3.5/5", "", "", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Leigh Paatsch", "\u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez-Santos", "Sean French", "David Denby", "Hilary Mantel", "Cathy Burke", "David Nusair", "Dustin Putman", "Christopher Lloyd", "Jeffrey M.
