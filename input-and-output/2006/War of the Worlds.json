When his ex-wife, Mary Ann (Miranda Otto), drops them off at Ferrier's house, it seems as though it will be just another tension-filled weekend. However, when electromagnetic pulses of lightning strike the area, the strange event turns out to be the beginning of an alien invasion, and Ferrier must now protect his children as they seek refuge.", "rating": "75", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "Steven Spielberg", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "Jun 29, 2005", "dvd_date": "Jun 3, 2016", "box_office": "$234.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The great weakness, ultimately, of the film is that its ambivalence, unease and discomfort about American realities in general and the \"war on terror\" in particular are not placed in the forefront, developed or worked through to the end.", "The carnage is more colossal than in most disaster movies, the sets are spectacularly ominous, the CG is impressive, and the desperation is more psychologically trying.", "War of the Worlds pulses with excitement, danger and palpable nervous energy that generates a legitimate and lasting awe.", "Spielberg always delivers a quality product and teaming him with Cruise results in a well done, modern rendition of this classic story.", "While the Wells story is a classic, Spielberg manages to find a way to truly make War of the Worlds his own.", "Spielberg does a masterful job of building the tension and creating an effective science-fiction thriller.", "Moves from one action set piece to another, seeing everything only through the eyes of its main characters, and in doing so avoids many sci-fi clich\u00e9s.", "If director Steven Spielberg's past close encounters with benevolent aliens seems worlds away, his habitual technical mastery hasn't deserted him.", "On one hand the movie is a game, a conscious display... of Spielberg's technical mastery; on the other it reaches toward what might be prophecy, or passionate allegory, or exhortation to mindfulness of real human suffering.", "The story is affecting, the action scenes are thrilling, the issues are resonant.", "An unstoppable juggernaut of action and anxiety that will have you blundering from the cinema in a state of nervous exhaustion. Don't expect any soft drink promotional tie-ins with this summer blockbuster.", "War of the Worlds is that most rare of screen adaptations - a film that is faithful to its origins and at the same time, its own separate creature.
