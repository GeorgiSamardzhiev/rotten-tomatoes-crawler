{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Unabashedly hedonistic and foul-mouthed, Lynda Mansell (Emily Lloyd) is a restless teen living in a small coastal English town. Lynda is seemingly out to shock people with her rebellious behavior, but she is also reeling from the death of her mother, and her father (Geoffrey Hutchings) is proving to be woefully ineffective in guiding her. Eventually, Lynda becomes pregnant by her dad's much-older friend, Eric (Tom Bell), which causes a scandal in the community.", "rating": "84", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 31m", "director": "David Leland", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 19, 2020", "box_office": "$161.4K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It has a strange iconoclast charm. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Newcomer Emily Lloyd, blond and mischievously lovely, is heartbreaking and irritating in equal parts as the hedonistic Lynda.", "The script by director David Leland was the perfect vehicle for his young star [Emily Lloyd] who is alternately hilariously rude and vulnerable, an unusual mixture for a woman or girl character in films, TV or literature even today.", "Wish You Were Here is the story of Lynda's messy coming of age. It's a movie to cherish -- bouyant, affecting, one of a kind.", "Although first-time director David Leland has a gold mine in Lloyd, he clutters the film with grotesque characters who give this small British town a surrealistic circus quality.", "As Lynda, the belligerent, exhibitionist daughter of a strait-laced British shopkeeper, Lloyd is electrifying. She's a foul-mouthed Hayley Mills.", "Leland has not, as I say, made up his mind as to which kind of film he is making, and so the mood of Wish You Were Here bounces uncomfortably back and forth between playful sass and grim decline-and-fall melodrama.", "Idyllic despite its inherent naughtiness, Wish You Were Here is a raunchy postcard from an age that exists largely now for filmakers to make of it what they want.", "Just as Lynda's language is an affront to her neighbors, so is Leland's film an enthusiastic assault on the excessive gentility of so much British filmmaking.", "Wish You Were Here may always be thought of as the movie that first gave us Emily Lloyd. Or as David Leland's first directing achievement.", "What makes it interesting is the character of the heroine; her refreshing rudeness disconcerts those around her.", "The trouble is that Lloyd's loud, brattish performance makes Linda less a socially purgative Free Spirit than a pain in the neck.", "As the title indicates, it's a film about yearning for someone dearly missed.", "", "", "", "", "", "Wish You Were Here features a smashingly good performance by Emily Lloyd as a spunky, erotic, and out-spoken teenager.", ""], "rating": ["", "", "", "5/5", "2.5/4", "3/4", "", "3/5", "3/4", "4/5", "", "", "C+", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["\u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez-Santos", "Molly Haskell", "Ren Jender", "Jay Boyar", "", "Carrie Rickey", "Ben Yagoda", "", "Dave Kehr", "Sheila Benson", "Variety Staff", "Geoff Andrew", "Dennis Schwartz", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "Emanuel Levy", "Lori Hoffman", "Thomas Delapa", "Daniel M.
