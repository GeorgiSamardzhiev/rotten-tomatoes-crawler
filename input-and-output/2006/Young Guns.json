When Tunstall is gunned down by the crooked Lawrence G.

Another word is \"trite.\"", "It's a western that shows both box-office calculation and respect for American history.", "There's some tough action sequences and a personable cast - including cameos from Tom Cruise and Brooke Shields - in a movie that (almost) kick-started a fading genre.", "Yet the story is told with too much affection for gunplay and the only thought worth preserving is that these mythic figures of the Old West often were very young men. Big deal.", "It's glossy, slick and stylish, but boasts very little in the way of substance or excitement.", "Though it pales beside such antecedents as Arthur Penn's \"The Left-Handed Gun\" or Sam Peckinpah's \"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid,\" it has a slick, smoky vigor.", "Young Guns is an unexpectedly entertaining film. It puts new twists into the familiar terrain of the western.", "The boys shoot, ride, flirt, get high on peyote and revel in enough self-adoring, anachronistic behavior to have all but inveterate teenyboppers swearing vengeance on the film's makers.", "Violent '80s Western with teen appeal.", "As Billy the Kid, Emilio Estevez is the nominal star here, but no one really shines.", "OK rehash of Old West villains, this time teaming them up in their early days.", "Good idea to cast the brat pack in a Western but this was badly realised and altogether a bit flat.", "Christopher Cain directed this western from a script by John Fusco, and on the whole seems much more comfortable with the scroungy and scatological dialogue than he does with the action sequences.", "Young Guns is simply not a very good movie--western or otherwise. Fusco's script provides little character development and muddies the narrative with some unlikely supporting characters.", "A cool Western for Gen X.", "Little more than a flawed romp, but energetic and enjoyable, with sterling performances from Sutherland and Estevez.", "", ""], "rating": ["", "2/4", "", "3/5", "3/5", "2/4", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "3/5", "2/5", "", "2/5", "3/4", "", "6/10", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Schickel", "Dave Kehr", "David Sterritt", "Adrian Turner", "Sky Staff", "Gene Siskel", "Film4 Staff", "Michael Wilmington", "Candice Russell", "Peter Travers", "Andrea Beach", "Variety Staff", "Steve Crum", "Ian Nathan", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "TV Guide Staff", "Jeffrey M.
