It's necessary to understand why they do what they do, but it makes what they're doing occasionally dull.", "16 Blocks is a good watch thanks to the performances of Bruce Willis and Mos Def.", "B-movie done with shrewd aplomb", "At its heart, this is actually an excellent film. But, as filmmakers seek to escalate the big action, believability suffers severely.", "", "There's a fine line between old-fashioned and cliched.", "The most high-octane action-- pyrotechnics, fisticuffs, gunplay, car crashes, back alley dashes and fire escape leaps-- ever crammed into a pressure-cooked chase lasting less than a mile.", "The action is fast paced and the story throws in a couple of twists to keep you on your toes.", "El oficio del director Richard Donner convierte a este policial de rutina en un digno entretenimiento. Ni ms ni menos.", "Willis and Def are wonderful...Donner (Lethal Weapon) unleashes a tight, effective yarn", "The story has been cobbled together from familiar elements; however, it arranges these elements in ways that are occasionally surprising, and in ways that accord nicely with Christian ideas about sin, repentance and redemption.", "Richard Donner (Superman, Lethal Weapon/s) is a respected old pro who knows how to make an action movie that delivers thrills and maybe something to chew on as well.", "Willis salvages what is essentially a routine thriller and elevates it to something worth watching.", "A happier surprise is the smart work of director Richard Donner: 16 Blocks is all jumble and jangle-crowds, snarled traffic, and discordant car horns.", "The movie pays off generously and just as expected.", "A solid, bare-knuckle action-thriller from Richard Lethal Weapon Donner that avoids most of the genre's clichs and boasts a commendably dishevelled performance from Willis, as a washed-up NYPD flatfoot dissolving in self-loathing.", "Willis has been playing slight variations on this role for years now, and though the films don't get better, his performances do.", "Clunky, solid, enjoyable.", "Fast-paced, tense and intermittently exciting, Donner's latest will keep genre fans engaged with its polished blend of tried and tested elements."], "rating": ["", "6/10", "3/5", "", "2.5/4", "3/4", "", "3.5/4", "3/4", "3/5", "", "3/4", "", "6/10", "", "2.5/4", "3/5", "", "", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Sean Axmaker", "Joshua Starnes", "Matthew Pejkovic", "Fernando F.
