{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 480 B.C. a state of war exists between Persia, led by King Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro), and Greece. At the Battle of Thermopylae, Leonidas (Gerard Butler), king of the Greek city state of Sparta, leads his badly outnumbered warriors against the massive Persian army. Though certain death awaits the Spartans, their sacrifice inspires all of Greece to unite against their common enemy.", "rating": "61", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "1h 57m", "director": "Zack Snyder", "studio": "AtmosphereEntertainmentMMLLC,LegendaryPictures,VirtualStudios,WarnerBros.", "theater_date": "Mar 9, 2007", "dvd_date": "Apr 28, 2009", "box_office": "$210.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Stylized violence at its finest.", "If you're looking to see the rich, deep imagery of 300 play out in the most beautiful, bone-crunching way possible, this 4K offering is absolutely a must-have.", "Butler encompasses the demeanor of a mighty and powerful king/warrior whom men would follow into battle.", "Very violent, but rich in atmosphere and amazing visuals.", "300 isn't up to the same level as Sin City, but it is still quite entertaining. Fans of blood, gore, and comic book violence won't be disappointed.", "By no means great art, but it most certainly is fantastic trash.", "A highly stylised fantasy, its colour palette both lush and gloomy. Leonidas is inspiring and practical and as usual when Butler's playing someone who isn't from Scotland, 50% Scottish. Headey is terrific, put her in charge of the Ancient World right now.", "What's really striking about the film is that it doesn't even have the aesthetics of a comic book, to say nothing of a graphic novel-the best examples of which, at least, show considerable concern for subtle narrative rhythms.", "If you're in the mood for dumb, rousing, visceral excitement, you're not going to find anything on the big screen right now to rival it.", "There is an intelligent movie to be made about Spartan warrior culture, but 300 is not it. It is a fun ride, though, as long as you don't see it on a full stomach.", "Our instinctual desire to sneer at the implausibility of the story is stalled by a sense of ambition that seems unmatched even by the standards of the Hollywood assembly line.", "So manly it makes Troy look like a Mary-Kate and Ashley adventure.", "Wallowing in the same adolescent nihilism as his Sin City, this adaptation of Frank Miller's graphic novel suffers from a similar lack of momentum.", "Despite a cracking central premise and outstanding visuals, 300 ultimately leaves you feeling more gutted than some of the disemboweled soldiers on display throughout the movie.", "As the first blockbuster of the year, 300 sets the bar high enough, and is enjoyably silly.", "If 300 represents an evolution in 'virtual' cinema, then at the same time it tells a story that transports us back to the violent roots of western civilisation.", "Awesome!", "Visually thrilling and viscerally satisfying.", "Asscrack-ugly", "[Snyder] twists the brawn and battle into a cartoonish FX extravaganza with severed body parts and globules of blood flying across the screen."], "rating": ["8/10", "4/5", "4.5/5", "3/5", "B", "3/4", "4/5", "", "2.5/4", "3/4", "3/4", "4/5", "2/5", "", "7/10", "", "A+", "4/5", "", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Andrew Pollard", "Allison Rose", "Leigh Paatsch", "Micheal Compton", "Matthew Lucas", "Sarah Cartland", "Daniel Mendelsohn", "James Vance", "Hannah Brown", "David Keyes", "Ali Gray", "Ben Kenigsberg", "Ben Rawson-Jones", "Coco Forsythe", "Andrew Osmond", "Neil Miller", "Scott Huver", "Fernando F.
