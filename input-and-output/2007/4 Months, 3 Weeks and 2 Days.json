[Full review in Spanish]", "A formidable and empathetic expression of the necessity for human agency.", "High production values thanks not only to Mungui but also cinematographer Oleg Mutu, superlative acting and compelling story make it easy to see why 4 MONTHS, 3 WEEKS AND 2 DAYS was handed the Palm D'Or by Jane Fonda...", "A searing, unforgettable film that is a future classic of the New Romanian Cinema.", "The film's omission by the Academy was so controversial that it was largely responsible for a change in the way nominations in that category are now processed.", "[Christian] Mungiu has taken a leap forward into bold, focused storytelling.", "Regular spaces and regular interactions take on...a grave pressure cooker effect...the film nearly becomes unbearable as small actions, movements, looks, and utterances take on an affectation of desperation and the utmost importance.", "4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days, which was unjustly denied an Academy Award nomination for best foreign-language film, is grueling and unsentimental. The excellent acting is what keeps it humane.", "Mungiu called the film one of his \"Tales From the Golden Age,\" but there's nothing satirical or sardonic about the story or the drama, and none of the sentimental East German \"Estalgia\" for the good old days of comforting Communist rule in sight.", "", "How it makes you feel depends little, if at all, about your position on abortion. The procedure acts as a MacGuffin for caustic commentary about Communist clampdowns and a friendship's annihilative death spiral through loyalty, desperation and sacrifice.", "No one in Bucharest gives a damn about anything. And he takes 113 long, drawn-out minutes to send this bit of news.", "Unrelieved gloom", "Director Cristian Mungiu makes effective use of fairly static camera setups, in addition to some hand-held shots, to give the film a documentary feel.", "Extremely powerful story about women dealing with illegal abortion issues in Stalinist Romania, but it is not a simple propaganda movie. In fact, it is a sublime if deeply troubling work of art.", "Grippingly horrible.", "For people who take their movies seriously, a quick course in Romanian might now be necessary -- and so is a trip to the theater to see 4 Months.", "", "[A] brilliant, suspenseful, absolutely riveting film."], "rating": ["", "5/5", "4/5", "", "4/4", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "4/4", "", "", "B", "", "5/5", "", "A-", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Piers Marchant", "Javier Oca\u00f1a", "Nicholas Bell", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Matthew Lucas", "Matt Brunson", "Kristin M.
