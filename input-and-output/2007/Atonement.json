[Full review in Spanish]", "McAvoy, long an underrated actor and also a Golden Globe nominee, fares even better here as the wrongly accused Robbie.", "Where Wright does succeed is in making absolutely lucid McEwan's fascinating central theme of atonement.", "Every bit as emotionally affecting as it is visually sweeping.", "It is an elegant and sophisticated film, one that never condescends or shirks from the complexity of the novel and its grand themes - war, love, sex, memory, betrayal, redemption - but it's also strangely unfeeling.", "Keep any advance knowledge of this superb drama to an absolute minimum, as it deserves every chance to work its devastating wonders upon an unsuspecting audience.", "Impeccable design, perfect casting, sound that takes the clack of a typewriter and embeds it into all sorts of furious onscreen rhythms... I was swooning even before the love story kicked in.", "", "Atonement's goal is so ephemeral that film may not be able to do it complete justice. All that said, it's still a fantastic piece of craftsmanship, benefiting from loving direction and excellent performances.", "An epic, grandiose, and immensely sad film, Atonement is an extremely well crafted, visually rich love story set during a tumultuous time of war, where two impassioned characters are forever torn apart by the selfish jealousy of another.", "Figurines in a teacup set, shipped over in boxes labeled 'For your consideration'", "Frustratingly uneven, struggling to maintain momentum as it lurches through extended lulls and indulges in cliched genre affectations.", "zaslu%u017Euje pohvale, ali ne onakve kakve bi trebao imati ozbiljni kandidat za \"Oscara\"", "Players outshine the script", "Director Joe Wright and screenwriter Christopher Hampton tap into the underlying passion and pathos from which all the absurdity, irony, and poetry follow.", "Ranks among the best films of the year.", "It's a romantic epic, set in the past, featuring some beautiful imagery, high drama and terrific performances from its small, all British cast. It's also (which isn't always a given when it comes to Best Picture contenders) a great movie.", "Atonement may look and sound like a Best Picture candidate, but that's all Wright's doing.", "Joe Wright directs Atonement with an eye to framing each performance with spectacularly vivid images, including a genuinely breathtaking tracking shot on the bloody, wreckage-strewn beach at Dunkirk."], "rating": ["9/10", "3/5", "3.5/4", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "4.5/5", "", "A-", "8/10", "4/5", "", "2.5/4", "7/10", "4/5", "3/4", "9/10", "4/4", "3.5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Josu Lapresa", "Richard Propes", "PJ Nabarro", "Matthew Lucas", "Deborah Ross", "Leigh Paatsch", "Annie Wagner", "Nell Minow", "Joshua Starnes", "Matthew Pejkovic", "Fernando F.
