{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After a crash that kills her boyfriend, Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone) has her car searched by the police, who find illegal drugs. Prosecutors handling her case send Tramell to see psychiatrist Michael Glass (David Morrissey). Glass determines that Tramell, a novelist whose books deal with sensational murders, might just be a dangerous person herself. But his findings don't prevent him from embarking on a sexually charged relationship with the cunning cougar.", "rating": "6", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense/Romance", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "Michael Caton-Jones", "studio": "IntermediaProductions", "theater_date": "Mar 31, 2006", "dvd_date": "May 23, 2016", "box_office": "$5.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Stone appears to have torn a page from the soap-opera textbook of come-hither acting.", "Glass is clearly meant to be a morally gray doctor...but that ambiguity and Morrissey's lack of sexual chemistry with Stone (who is vacant in her second go at the character) simply drains the life from this whole enterprise.", "This film isn't just bad, it's howlingly bad.", "Stone is simply awful, replacing the sexy insouciance from the first film with a beady stare that would seem more appropriate coming from a dead codfish than a calculating nympho adept at playing twisted mind games.", "Morrissey gives a good impersonation of a lobotomised Liam Neeson: possibly the only way to play a character dead from the script upwards.", "There are plot developments occurring throughout the picture that have the subtlety of a carnival sideshow, and things never add up sufficiently as an intellectual exercise.", "We actually don't see very much killing at all--except, maybe, that of the careers of Morrissey and Stone.", "Silly, shock-pandering lines like that nearly sink the film to Showgirls level.", "In spite of Sharon Stone's hearty encore performance as the ultimate femme fatale, \"Basic Instinct 2\" falls unbearably flat.", "", "jedan od rijetkih primjera kada je publika pokazala kako, za razliku od Hollywooda, ipak ima pojma o nekim stvarima", "Sadly, nothing following lives up to the prurient promise of this sequence, as the film becomes a monotonously talky, gloomy affair.", "Poor Sharon Stone.
