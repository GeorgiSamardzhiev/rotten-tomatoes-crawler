{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Befriended by aristocrat Sebastian Flyte (Ben Whishaw), Oxford student Charles Ryder (Matthew Goode) finds that the power and privilege experienced by the family is seductive. On a visit to Brideshead, the ancestral home, he falls in love with his friend's sister, Julia (Hayley Atwell). However, as Charles' ties to Sebastian and family deepen, he finds himself at odds with their strong Roman Catholicism.", "rating": "62", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 14m", "director": "Julian Jarrold", "studio": "EcosseFilms", "theater_date": "Jul 25, 2008", "dvd_date": "Oct 8, 2016", "box_office": "$6.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Sourced from sixty years old material featuring spats, snoods and Model Ts but its themes of religious fundamentalism, pursuit of individualism and happiness, sexual tolerance and class are as current as anything on screens at your local multi-plex.", "A miscast Emma Thompson in a white wig is the story's steely enforcer of Catholic orthodoxy... She's such a monster that the film comes perilously close to turning into an Invasion of the Soul Snatchers.", "The strongest performance may very well belong to Emma Thompson, who manages to turn Lady Marchmain into both a disturbing yet surprisingly sympathetic woman.", "Anyone familiar with the book knows there's much more to the tale than what little makes the cut here.", "Brideshead derives no small measure of entertainment from its portrait of the British class hierarchy and Charles' aspirations to a higher class standing.", "Let the Oscar race begin. Sweeping, epic, sumptuous, period perfect, decadent, religious, familial. BRIDESHEAD REVISITED is the Best Picture to beat this year!", "A lot of pretty faces in pretty costumes making each other, and the audience, completely miserable.", "Director Julian Jarrold... has made a beautiful film that marvelously captures the heady atmosphere of the novel and coaxed compelling performances from his three young leads.", "Director Julian Jarrold and screenwriters Andrew Davies and Jeremy Brock seem to have no idea how to interpret their source material.", "This Brideshead is less a dramatization than what you might call a melodramatization.", "It's easy to overstate the varied accomplishments here because of how badly it might have gone. That it landed somewhere between adequate and excellent is satisfying enough.", "Unfortunately, the film doesn't linger at Oxford for long, and the remaining point on the love triangle-Sebastian's sister, Julia-is always present, but only fleetingly interesting.", "", "A bleak and often befuddling 2-hour-15-minute disappointment.", "", "slow and beautiful, rather than intense, dramatic and insightful", "it still has the high-class dramatic feel you'd expect from something you would have watched on PBS twenty years ago", "Occasionally interesting, always beautiful and regularly tedious, the film attempts to capture a time and a feeling yet it ultimately fails to provide the depth needed to make it wholly successful.", "Certainly passable, but less than spectacular, Brideshead Revisited is an authentic and decent adaptation of a well-known novel, but nothing more.", "The events in the film felt rushed and overly obvious, as if Harry Potter's adopted parents dressed him in an \"Ask me about wizardry\" t-shirt before Hagrid ever turned up."], "rating": ["3/5", "", "3.0/4", "1.5/5", "", "", "2/4", "2.5/4", "", "", "", "", "2/4", "2/4", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "", "7", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Jason Best", "Richard Propes", "Leigh Paatsch", "Felicia Feaster", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Matthew Lucas", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Megan Basham", "Daniel Mendelsohn", "Justin Stewart", "Annie Wagner", "Wesley Morris", "Mike Scott", "Roger Moore", "Simon Weaving", "Kevin Carr", "Ryan Cracknell", "Brian Webster", "Karina Montgomery"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">What&#39;s On TV", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Charleston City Paper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">From the Front Row", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WORLD", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New York Review of Books", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Stop Smiling", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Stranger (Seattle, WA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Globe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times-Picayune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screenwize", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">7M Pictures", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Views", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Apollo Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinerina"], "date": ["January 31, 2021", "November 13, 2020", "September 4, 2020", "July 17, 2020", "January 27, 2020", "November 7, 2019", "July 6, 2019", "December 13, 2018", "October 11, 2018", "August 29, 2018", "August 24, 2017", "August 21, 2017", "November 24, 2011", "August 14, 2009", "May 13, 2009", "April 4, 2009", "March 5, 2009", "January 25, 2009", "January 7, 2009", "November 9, 2008"]}}
