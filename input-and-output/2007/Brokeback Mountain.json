{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1963, rodeo cowboy Jack Twist (Jake Gyllenhaal) and ranch hand Ennis Del Mar (Heath Ledger) are hired by rancher Joe Aguirre (Randy Quaid) as sheep herders in Wyoming. One night on Brokeback Mountain, Jack makes a drunken pass at Ennis that is eventually reciprocated. Though Ennis marries his longtime sweetheart, Alma (Michelle Williams), and Jack marries a fellow rodeo rider (Anne Hathaway), the two men keep up their tortured and sporadic affair over the course of 20 years.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 14m", "director": "Ang Lee", "studio": "ParamountPictures,FocusFeatures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 11, 2015", "box_office": "$83.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Brokeback Mountain serves as something of an antidote to the incessant homophobic harping...", "It is challenging to find a movie that grabs you as hard as this does. The story lingers long after its woeful end, ultimately showing the power of such an amazing film, while also keeping and transferring the theme of longing to its audience.", "Heath Ledger gives an Oscar-worthy take on a man who already seems in mourning for a loss he will be late to grasp.", "Ledger hits all the right notes as Ennis, delivering a quiet performance filled with heartache and sorrow.", "The passion created here...makes no restrictions on who can understand and appreciate it. This is as fine a love story as there is. [May 10, 2018]", "Lee has crafted a film that flouts stereotypes and becomes one of the most sincere, most deeply felt love stories in years.", "What is remarkable about the film is how it doesn't politicise the homosexuality theme, transcends it to become the story of two people in doomed love. The two lead characters are wonderfully delineated.", "The real achievement of Brokeback Mountain is not that it tells a universal love story that happens to have gay characters in it, but that it tells a distinctively gay story that happens to be so well told that any feeling person can be moved by it.", "An important and original romance that really and finally portrays the homosexual romance as two humans falling in love and never plays it for clich\u00e9s...", "A romantic western with a twist, Brokeback Mountain is a haunting and well acted exploration of a forbidden and secretive love affair between two cowboys.", "Brokeback Mountain is in no rush. Its emotional impact builds slowly, its rhythms in tune with the countryside--the rugged grandeur of the mountains; the arid, bleak vistas of backwater Western towns.", "Brokeback Mountain is ultimately about the paralysis of regret and how it fractures the lives of not just those afflicted by it, but everyone else around them.", "Lee can't tell the difference between criticizing oppression and turning out an oppressed work", "Arguably Ang Lee's best film, this swooning, achingly sad near-masterpiece offers a universal love story that lingers long in the mind.", "If you have the patience to sit through a slow-moving romance and you lack the vanity to be put off by explicit cowboy on cowboy relations, you'll greatly appreciate the light at the end of Brokeback Mountain, a work of art that's more than just a movie.", "At times feels as ancient and familiar as any well-worn piece of American legend, even if its content could set John Wayne spinning in his grave.", "At its core, Brokeback Mountain is not a gay love story%u2013it is simply a love story.", "It has the simplicity and clarity of a fable, wedded to the gnarled and taciturn physical realism of the Western.", "A masterful telling of star crossed love, with all the complications of any affair. Neither gratuitous nor shying away from the hidden pasion, Lee crafts a sublte and quite beautful film.", ""], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "4/4", "4/4", "3/4", "", "", "4/5", "", "A+", "", "4/5", "4/5", "", "8/10", "5/5", "A", "A-"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Joanne Laurier", "Kristy Strouse", "David Lamble", "Micheal Compton", "Luke Parker", "Matthew Lucas", "Namrata Joshi", "Daniel Mendelsohn", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Matthew Pejkovic", "David Ansen", "Rubin Safaya", "Fernando F.
