{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After the death of her best friend's husband from cancer, spirited Yorkshire housewife Chris Harper (Helen Mirren) hatches a scheme to raise money for a memorial to him. Utilizing a tradition from the hidebound Woman's Institute association, Chris encourages Annie (Julie Walters) and their friends to create a calendar -- with the novel detail of using the middle-aged women of their village as nude models. The idea stuns the husbands and a wary young photographer (Philip Glenister).", "rating": "74", "genre": "Comedy/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Nigel Cole", "studio": "TouchstonePictures", "theater_date": "Jan 1, 2004", "dvd_date": "Nov 7, 2015", "box_office": "$31.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Calendar Girls is a prime example of why Americans appreciate British humor.

That all of it really happened is almost beside the point but charming in itself.", "Although the material is somewhat slight, Mirren and her cohorts give it weight and verve.", "...proves Andy Warhol's famous dictum, with one added wrinkle: In the future, everyone will be famous for 15 minutes, especially if you take your clothes off.", "...a bit of enjoyable fluff...", "Mirren again shows us why she is still able to obtain leading vehicles at age 58.", "", "The marvellous cast and robust humour work to create a delightful comedy that's both sexy and sassy.
