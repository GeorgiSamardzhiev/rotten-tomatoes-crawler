{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the 1980s U.S.Rep. Charlie Wilson (Tom Hanks), Texas socialite Joanne Herring (Julia Roberts) and CIA agent Gust Avrakotos (Philip Seymour Hoffman) form an unlikely alliance to boost funding for Afghan freedom fighters in their war against invading Soviets. The trio's successful efforts to finance these covert operations contributes to the fall of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Mike Nichols", "studio": "PlaytoneProductions", "theater_date": "Dec 21, 2007", "dvd_date": "Feb 26, 2016", "box_office": "$66.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Politics - dirty or otherwise - has never been so much fun.", "The (shameful) Yankee foreign policy of the 1980s... told humorously (naturally!).

Enormously pleasurable company, since you ask. True, he's a lech, but such a gallant lech, plus he also gets irony.", "It's a timely reminder: Ending a war is all very nice, but watch out for what comes next.", "Set the irony meter at eleven and enjoy.", "Aaron Sorkin has written an acute, hilarious, and informative screenplay which is rich with character, and is perfect fodder for director Mike Nichols, who has a knack for meshing comedy and drama.", "The satire darkens not into sobering relevance but into wishy-washy 'relevance'", "The international intrigue becomes strained satire -- what's needed is the comic touch of a Billy Wilder.", "Charlie Wilson's War features two characters who know how government is supposed to work. They also know it doesn't work as it is supposed to, so they have to subvert the system and go beyond it.", "Hanks may at first seem like an unlikely choice to play a seasoned Texas playboy bachelor, but he's so ingratiating that he almost pulls it off.", "Hanks' performance as Wilson is tone-perfect, capturing both the public-servant seriousness and playboy rakishness of his character. And he does it without breaking a sweat.", "Charlie Wilson's War is both funny and entertaining. In fact, as far as making political points, you kind of have to look for them.", "At a short 93 minutes, it feels as though Charlie Wilson's War was hacked up in the editing room, leaving the bare bones of the structure but little of the really juicy meat.", "", "All of the actors clearly relish the film's fast and busy pace, smart dialog and vivid characterisations.", "Hanks does a great job, brimming with the sort of charisma and charm that the real Charlie Wilson presumably had in spades."], "rating": ["1", "3/5", "3.0/4", "", "3/4", "3/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "2.5/4", "2.5/5", "B", "", "3.5/4", "2/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Maril\u00f3 Garc\u00eda", "Richard Propes", "David Lamble", "Matthew Lucas", "Leigh Paatsch", "Deborah Ross", "Annie Wagner", "Kelly Vance", "Matthew Pejkovic", "Fernando F.
