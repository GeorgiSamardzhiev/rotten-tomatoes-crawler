{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Finally alone for the holidays, Luther (Tim Allen) and Nora Krank (Jamie Lee Curtis) plan to eschew the Christmas traditions and take a cruise in the Caribbean instead. This doesn't sit well with their Christmas-obsessed neighbors Vic Frohmeyer (Dan Aykroyd) and Walt Scheel (M. Emmet Walsh), who are determined to win the annual \"best decorated street\" competition, and the Kranks soon find themselves social outcasts because of their lack of Christmas spirit.", "rating": "5", "genre": "Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Joe Roth", "studio": "1492Pictures,RevolutionStudios", "theater_date": "Nov 24, 2004", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$73.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This exhausting parade of white people's Christmas problems offers only banality, blandness, and the most desperately unfunny sitcom hijinks imaginable.", "Allen was a bit low energy for my liking but actually came off better in his more sincere scenes towards the end of the film.", "We loved him as Santa. We loved her as the hooker with a heart. We love Christmas. ... After seeing Christmas with the Kranks, all I can say is it put me in one kranky mood for the holidays over such a waste of talent!", "Forget the 12 Days of Christmas; there are at least 12,000 ways that 2004's fascistic Christmas with the Kranks earns the honor as the worst Yuletide film ever made.", "Unoriginal, unfunny slapstick holiday fare.", "Christmas With The Kranks is the sort of film that leaves you thinking Ebenezer Scrooge might have had the right idea about the festive season.", "A grueling experience.", "The notion of bullying people into succumbing into the trappings of Christmas does not necessarily represent goodwill to all, and while the situations present good comic opportunities, the film ends up feeling rather manipulative and sugary.", "Some pathetically predictable plot twists and syrupy sentimentality, which could only amuse a five year-old, lead the Kranks back to their materialistic senses in time for a Kodak moment which shouts a rather shallow Merry Capitalism to all!", "A more sweet than sour satire that sets its sight on nasty but lavishly honey coated underpinnings of the holiday season.", "In any normal year this dire comedy would be the undisputed lump of coal in our psychic stocking, but coming on the heels of Surviving Christmas, it's a close second.", "There is not a single lifelike character in the entire picture.", "[A] comedy so broad it barely dents its targets and a patronising moral conclusion that goes against everything its protagonists originally stood for.", "This isn't a wonderful life: It looks pretty hellish.", "It is a perfectly fine, inoffensive family comedy.", "What better way is there to get into a festive spirit than having it crammed down your throat?", "...almost had me convinced to convert to Judaism to avoid having to go through anything ever again that even remotely resembles this movie.", "Curtis is easily the most talented actress of her generation to never garner an Oscar nomination.
