{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Prince Akeem (Eddie Murphy) is the prince of a wealthy African country and wants for nothing, except a wife who will love him in spite of his title. To escape an arranged marriage, Akeem flees to America accompanied by his persnickety sidekick, Semmi (Arsenio Hall), to find his queen. Disguised as a foreign student working in fast food, he romances Lisa (Shari Headley), but struggles with revealing his true identity to her and his marital intentions to his king father (James Earl Jones).", "rating": "67", "genre": "Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "John Landis", "studio": "Paramount", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$128.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Murphy shows genuine range in Coming to America and a willingness to sacrifice some raunch for some sweetness", "Will probably end up as Eddie Murphy's most balanced comedy, as well as his most popular.

But just barely.", "Murphy has dealt audiences the movie equivalent of a royal flush and he is now clearly Hollywood's reigning king of comedy.", "...a worthy followup to Murphy and Landis' first collaboration, Trading Places.", "Silly, curse-happy '80s Eddie Murphy vehicle.", "", "The director is ... rather distracted; John Landis seems to be browsing through the scenes rather than gobbling them down.", "Murphy gives his sweetest, most touching, and most genuinely likable performance to date, playing a character who embraces society instead of holding it in contempt.", "The winning combination of Landis and Murphy redeems the very predictable storyline, which is chock-full of snappy one-liners and impressive caricatures by Murphy and Hall.", "very funny and shows Eddie Murphy in his prime", "Not only a great comedic effort but Eddie Murphy's best romantic film as well.", "[Landis] takes a very specific joy in the act of moviemaking and calls attention to it, placing it at a level above the romantic story.", "Starts on a bathroom joke, quickly followed by a gag about private parts, then wanders in search of something equally original for Eddie Murphy to do for another couple of hours.", "so brilliant, it almost makes up for The Golden Child.", "Superb comic timing, a satirical edge, and Murphy's extraordinary gift for mimicry lift it right out of the trough of mediocrity to which it is all but consigned by its utterly predictable storyline."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "4/5", "3/4", "4.5/5", "4/10", "", "", "3/4", "3/4", "3/5", "4/5", "", "2.5/4", "", "3.5/5", "7", "", "", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["James Kendrick", "Fico Cangiano", "Matt Brunson", "Allison Rose", "Mike Massie", "Duane Byrge", "Cathy Burke", "Kathleen Carroll", "David Nusair", "Common Sense Media Editors", "", "Richard Schickel", "", "Film4 Staff", "Kevin Carr", "Jamie Gillies", "Jeffrey M.
