[Full Review in Spanish]", "Demolition Man is a movie that should have been fun, and isn't.", "Violent, profanity-filled '90s sci-fi action movie.", "Not for nothing does the film open on a screen-filling image of the Hollywood sign in flames, for it torches almost every supposition that a film made to showcase Sylvester Stallone and Wesley Snipes whomping on each other can only be brain-dead.", "", "Doesn't quite go far enough, instead settling for cheap gags and cheap thrills, but it tickles fairly well for a couple of hours of crashes and fireballs.

It is also undercut by casting virtually all the psychopathically murderous criminals as minority-group members.", "The pleasant surprise about Demolition Man is that both the script, and Stallone, are funny; the film blends big-budget action and tongue-in-cheek humor in the way that Last Action Hero tried, and failed, to do.", "Nearly all the SF premises are accorded the status of Andrew Dice Clay one-liners -- which means that they, along with the characters, keep changing from one scene to the next.", "A noisy, soulless, self-conscious pastiche that mixes elements of sci-fi, action-adventure and romance, then pours on a layer of comedy replete with Hollywood in-jokes.", "This futuristic comedy depends on your opinion of Stallone and his unapologetic popcorn-pleasing action no-brainers.
