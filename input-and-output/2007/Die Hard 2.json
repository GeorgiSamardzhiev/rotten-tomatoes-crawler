{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A year after his heroics in L.A, detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) is mixed up in another terrorist plot, this time at Washington Dulles International Airport, where he is waiting for his wife (Bonnie Bedelia). That same night, South American politico and drug profiteer Ramon Esperanza (Franco Nero) is arriving in U.S. custody. McClane takes action when a treasonous ex-colonel (William Sadler) seizes control of the airport, threatening to crash every inbound flight unless Esperanza is freed.", "rating": "69", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 4m", "director": "Renny Harlin", "studio": "SilverPictures,20thCenturyFox,GordonCompany", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$115.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Packs plenty of punch, heavy-hitting adventure, and explosions galore.", "The filmmakers know the audience is challenging them to top themselves, and they've risen to the bait. Harlin and company build suspense the old-fashioned way. They earn it.", "In a summer of wildly violent action films, 'Die Hard 2' stands out. It is the best action movie since 'Lethal Weapon II,' as vastly entertaining, exciting and improbable.", "This is the most cheerfully preposterous film of a jaw-dropping summer, which is not to say it's not fun, it's simply orchestrated Looney Tunes.", "Even in the action genre, there is such a thing as overkill. Die Hard 2: Die Harder pleads guilty to the charge but has enough redeeming plot twists to compensate for the excess.", "The summer's best sequel and most satisfying blockbuster has finally arrived. Die Hard 2 is a blast.", "Even when the script wanders into cynical overkill, Harlin makes sure the violence has some impact, some moral consequence, by sketching in characters for a few representative victims.", "Though it has an inventive and unexpected plot twist, Die Hard 2 lacks credibility. \"Die Hard\" was that rare modern action picture with a wholly believable plot.", "One might think a movie with a reported budget of $62 million would have had a few bucks to spend on a gaffe spotter.", "The filmmakers seem to be operating under the assumption that the way you top a successful movie is by making one that's louder, cruder and more violent.", "As vapid as it is violent.", "The screenplay is precariously supported by the chips on John McClane's shoulders. Fortunately, it is also designed to Willis' unique specs.", "Die Hard 2 delivers everything you'd expect from the title's promise. Trouble is, Die Hard 2 really didn't need to wallow in graphic violence to be a good, engaging picture.", "Bruce Willis wonders aloud how it could happen to him again, but dons the white singlet anyway for this second hugely entertaining slice of action hokum.", "As long as Willis is in his vest and playing McClane, it's hard to care about its shortcomings.", "Willis confirms his status as one of the best action men around -- he can actually act.", "While this sequel may not rise to the heights of the classic first, it is still a damn fine flick with lots to love.", "... Everything a good sequel should be.", "A number of scenes have been staged with satisfying kinetic flair, and Willis once again makes an appealing superhero. Yet without that great big booby-trapped skyscraper to hold the action together, the suspense dissipates.", "John McClane spreads vigilante Christmas cheer."], "rating": ["7/10", "", "B+", "", "", "3.5/4", "3/4", "2.5/4", "", "2/5", "", "3/4", "3/4", "4/5", "3/5", "", "8/10", "A", "B-", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "David Ansen", "George Anderson", "Sheila Benson", "Candice Russell", "John Hartl", "Dave Kehr", "Gary Thompson", "Ralph Novak", "Jay Boyar", "David Sterritt", "Carrie Rickey", "Dennis King", "John Ferguson", "", "", "JimmyO", "Greg Maki", "Owen Gleiberman", "Kelly Kessler"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">JoBlo&#39;s Movie Network", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Star-Democrat (Easton, MD)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media"], "date": ["September 11, 2020", "February 6, 2018", "January 3, 2018", "April 3, 2015", "April 3, 2015", "April 3, 2015", "April 3, 2015", "April 3, 2015", "April 3, 2015", "April 3, 2015", "April 3, 2015", "April 3, 2015", "April 3, 2015", "April 3, 2015", "April 3, 2015", "April 3, 2015", "February 12, 2013", "February 11, 2013", "September 7, 2011", "January 2, 2011"]}}
