And, certainly, he's stepped into something with this sprawling, old-fashioned melodrama.", "A little irreverence and some revisionist strokes would have lent some welcome spice to this bland meat-and-potatoes serving of U.S. history.", "What is a surprise is that Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman are almost entirely credible in their roles.", "Howard's lifelong ambition to make a film about his Irish ancestry results in a light confection, full of sweeping overhead shots and predictable pulp-fiction intrigue.", "This time the concept of TV-for-a-very-big-screen comes out silly.", "This is a very well-intentioned film and director Ron Howard does the best he can with it, but it is too long, too slow and too dumb.", "Far and Away looks like an epic, but it lacks flavor and texture. It's so predigested there's nothing left to chew on.", "The story is ridiculously old-fashioned, with romantic flourishes and visual spectacle (the land-rush scenes are outstanding) in place of an interesting storyline and well-developed characters.", "Even at its hokiest, Far and Away is never less than heartfelt.", "Though blatantly no Eyes Wide Shut, this second on-screen pairing for the Super-A couple remains a class apart from the dross that was Days Of Thunder.", "It's Ron Howard doing his \"thing.\" Which, if you don't know, is sucking it for all it is worth, with having little to begin with, and trying his darndest to spread an Oscar cream to illuminate it.", "With its terrific cast and splendid production values, Howard's family saga looks like far and away the grandest new-old movie of 1992.", "Ron Howard comes up with his own little creation myth for America, free of such inconvenient original sins as genocide and slavery.", "Away isn't for cynics, providing an authentic rush of experience that makes the effort feel huge, even when it details the smallest interests of the heart.", "Intense, treacly Cruise-Kidman immigrant epic.", "", "Poorly written and simplistically acted, the film also shows little chemistry between real-life couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman."], "rating": ["", "2.5/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "C", "C", "", "", "3/5", "3/5", "", "", "B+", "3/5", "2/5", "D"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Rachel Wagner", "Leigh Paatsch", "Dolores Barclay", "Hal Hinson", "Todd McCarthy", "John F.
