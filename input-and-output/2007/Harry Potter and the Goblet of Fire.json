{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The fourth movie in the Harry Potter franchise sees Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) returning for his fourth year at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, along with his friends, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson). There is an upcoming tournament between the three major schools of magic, with one participant selected from each school by the Goblet of Fire. When Harry's name is drawn, even though he is not eligible and is a fourth player, he must compete in the dangerous contest.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 37m", "director": "Mike Newell", "studio": "WarnerBros.,1492Pictures,HeydayFilms", "theater_date": "Nov 18, 2005", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2008", "box_office": "$290.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's increasingly evident that seven books and as many as eight theatrical adaptations fuel the need for too much filler subplots or nonessential side characters.", "More precious than a Golden Snitch in a game of Quidditch, this is one of the Must See films of the year.", "Good film directed for a teenage audience in which not only is magic taught but also how stereotypes affect it while the film itself recreates some British stereotypes. [Review in Spanish]", "For the first time, the stakes of this battle of good and evil become painfully evident.", "It feels rushed and there are definitely the most plotholes in this entry in the series. Still, when it does work it really works.", "Goblet of Fire is great, very watchable and re-watchable.", "Where Newell really scores is in taking a leaf out of Peter Jackson's book and cranking up the fear factor.", "For those like me who are outside but sympathetic to the faith, it looks like another handsomely made, good-natured and high-spirited family movie, which is dramatically stymied through being locked within school grounds.", "For the first time, adults might actually enjoy a Harry Potter film as much as children.", "Goblet is really just a glorified, 157-minute teaser trailer, an empty epic of proportions that truly stagger.", "The adolescent subplot is treated sweetly by Newell. The awkward dances and dating faux pas at the school ball feel like additions from some other, less mythic series, and form a welcome respite from the intense magic-making of the rest of the film.", "Much of the credit goes to Radcliffe and his co-stars, who have become better actors with each film. They have become increasingly adept at conveying great emotion as each film demands more of them.", "I think this is the best Potter film yet, for one simple reason: it's not like a Harry Potter film.", "In its last third, The Goblet of Fire builds to a climax of such overpowering dread that you might just forget the rest. Harry grows up in an instant, and the film does, too.", "The acting is stronger than ever in this fourth installment.", "By demonstrating to us how Harry and his friends are budding and changing and struggling, the film demonstrates the progressive richness of Rowling's storytelling skills and oddly haunting allure of her writing.", "All in all, Goblet of Fire is certainly the best Potter yet, with most of the cast doing their roles justice, some great direction and Steven Kloves' screenplay makes the core of Rowling's novel into a fast-paced but easily-comprehensible enjoyable movie.", "Kloves has streamlined J. K. Rowling's 700-plus-page opus into cinematic fighting form. And the special effects, which threatened to overwhelm the first two movies, are seamlessly integrated.", "Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire is mostly satisfying, simply because such technical precision and meaningful special effects are rare in fantasy films today.", "This fourth segment of now-adolescent Harry Potter's story, while arguably the best made, is also the most gruesome, and dark."], "rating": ["6/10", "", "4/5", "3/4", "B-", "", "4/5", "3/5", "", "1.5/5", "3.5/5", "4/4", "", "", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "5/5", "", "B+", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Guillem Martinez Oya", "Matthew Lucas", "Rachel Wagner", "Jeremy Jahns", "Sukhdev Sandhu", "Peter Bradshaw", "Victoria Segal", "Jim Schembri", "Jay Stone", "Michael Kleinschrodt", "Cosmo Landesman", "Amy Biancolli", "Matt Soergel", "Dennis King", "Daniel Saney", "David Ansen", "Steve Persall", "Dan Webster"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinematismo", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">JeremyJahns.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Statesman", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Age (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Canada.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times-Picayune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sunday Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Houston Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Florida Times-Union", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Digital Spy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tampa Bay Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spokesman-Review (Washington)"], "date": ["September 29, 2020", "November 13, 2019", "July 11, 2019", "June 5, 2019", "April 4, 2019", "January 26, 2018", "December 8, 2014", "December 8, 2014", "December 8, 2014", "December 8, 2014", "December 8, 2014", "December 8, 2014", "December 8, 2014", "December 8, 2014", "December 8, 2014", "December 8, 2014", "December 8, 2014", "December 8, 2014", "December 8, 2014", "December 8, 2014"]}}
