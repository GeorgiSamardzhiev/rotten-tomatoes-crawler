{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Now in his fifth year at Hogwarts, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) learns that many in the wizarding community do not know the truth of his encounter with Lord Voldemort. Cornelius Fudge, minister of Magic, appoints his toady, Dolores Umbridge, as Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher, for he fears that professor Dumbledore will take his job. But her teaching is deficient and her methods, cruel, so Harry prepares a group of students to defend the school against a rising tide of evil.", "rating": "77", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 18m", "director": "David Yates", "studio": "WarnerBros.,HeydayFilms", "theater_date": "Jul 11, 2007", "dvd_date": "Dec 15, 2009", "box_office": "$292.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Clearly serving as an overly dependent middle section of the franchise, this is one of the more forgettable installments.", "The fifth Potter picture is one of the lesser entries in the series: way too rushed, and a mite too dour.", "A worthy sequel, but lacks surprises. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The film is more than satisfactory for fans of the series, but can't quite conjure up much else besides stunning visuals. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Despite lacking charisma, David Yates still manages to convey a dark epic feel to the affair. [Full Review in Spanish]", "After four magical cinematic chapters of Harry Potter, the franchise finally hits a bump in the road with Order of the Phoenix, which is full of plot detail and short of all the magic and charm that made this such a successful series.", "Good, but not quite great, Harry Potter and The Order of The Phoenix does not wear out its welcome, keeps the franchise intact, entertains and enthralls, and leaves us looking toward the future and the ultimate battle between Harry and Voldemort.", "Good film directed for a teenage audience in which not only is magic taught but also how stereotypes affect it while the film itself recreates some British stereotypes. [Review in Spanish]", "The most character-driven, dialogue-centric and politically astute Potter film yet.", "My new favorite of the series. I know that is unusual but this is the leanest storytelling in my opinion.", "The enjoyable moments nearly all occur when Potter newcomer Imelda Staunton, playing the latest 'Defence Against the Dark Arts' is on-screen. Alas, Yates' obsession with exposition over action is this dreary, utilitarian film's real undoing.", "Traditional drama is usually a three-act deal: set-up, conflict, resolution. But this is the three-act deal every two minutes. Danger, baddie, magic. Danger, baddie, magic. Danger, baddie, magic. It's as tired as it is tiresome.", "It feels like the slowest of Harry Potter movies...a great character dies, but he wasn't really utilized well, so you don't feel what you should...Order and the Phoenix is enjoyable and has its place, but it's my least favorite.", "Author J.K. Rowling clearly knew a totalitarian regime when she saw one, and never hesitated to call out the toadies and enablers along with her big baddie.", "This film does so many things right, it's hard to say what to single out for praise.", "By focussing the story on Harry (a leaner and slightly meaner Daniel Radcliffe) and his exploits, Yates dispenses with many of the novel's subplots and is able to push the story forward, ominously foreshadowing the dark times to come.", "The older these kids get, the darker and more engrossing the Harry Potter movies become.", "It's clear that Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix has left the dewy-eyed awe of childhood magic and entered the brooding angst of adolescent powerlessness.", "An emotional and involving installment in this hit or miss series", "Yates leaps into big-budget cinema like a kid in a candy store, packing in nearly every compelling image from the 870-page source material."], "rating": ["4/10", "3/5", "3/5", "", "3/5", "", "", "4/5", "3/4", "A+", "1/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "3.5/4", "A-", "3/4", "4/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Leigh Paatsch", "Sergi S\u00e1nchez", "Juan Luis Caviaro", "Virginia Montes", "Micheal Compton", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Guillem Martinez Oya", "Matthew Lucas", "Rachel Wagner", "Kaleem Aftab", "Deborah Ross", "Jeremy Jahns", "Rob Vaux", "Giovanni Fazio", "Bruce Diones", "Leah Rozen", "Jeff Meyers", "Roger Moore", "Steve Heisler"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fotogramas", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sensacine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinematismo", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The List", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">JeremyJahns.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema-stache", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Japan Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro Times (Detroit, MI)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tribune News Service", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out Chicago"], "date": ["November 24, 2020", "November 17, 2020", "November 30, 2019", "November 30, 2019", "November 30, 2019", "November 21, 2019", "November 13, 2019", "July 11, 2019", "June 6, 2019", "April 4, 2019", "November 3, 2018", "August 23, 2018", "January 25, 2018", "February 28, 2017", "June 15, 2016", "November 26, 2013", "November 26, 2013", "November 26, 2013", "January 13, 2013", "December 7, 2012"]}}
