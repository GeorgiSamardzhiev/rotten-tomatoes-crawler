{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Rugged cowboy Frank Hopkins (Viggo Mortensen) is an expert horseman who performs in Buffalo Bill's Wild West Show. When affluent Sheik Riyadh (Omar Sharif), piqued by tales of Hopkins' talent, challenges Hopkins to prove himself in a treacherous long-distance horse race called the Ocean of Fire, Hopkins is forced to oblige. In the Middle East with his American mustang, he must race against thoroughbred horses ridden by the best riders in the world with his reputation -- and his life -- at stake.", "rating": "46", "genre": "Action & Adventure", "runtime": "2h 15m", "director": "Joe Johnston", "studio": "TouchstonePictures,CaseySilverProductions,HidalgoProductions", "theater_date": "Mar 5, 2004", "dvd_date": "Feb 1, 2017", "box_office": "$67.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Although some of the colonial stylization is impressive, this Mortensen post-\"Rings\" vehicle is pure horse neck and camel meat.", "The film itself can't seem to decide whether it's a Saturday morning serial for the kids, a new Indiana Jones, or something with a bit more dramatic heft", "Sharif grounds the silliness a little. When he looks across the desert with those eyes that have always hinted that hard weather is coming, everybody else rushing around the set looks overdressed for a costume party.", "...the film's hold on the viewer dwindles steadily as it enters its progressively dull midsection...", "If you take it as historical fact, it's got a world of problems. But if you're just in the mood to be entertained, it can be a decent piece of Saturday afternoon escapism.", "Whether or not the events depicted really happened to Hopkins, it's still a damn fun story.", "Formulaic, overly simple, too violent for tweens.", "", "The event around which the movie revolves is a desert mirage, since there is no record of any such race ever being staged. Nonetheless, those able to ignore this outrageous historical distortion might enjoy this triumph of an underdog aganst the odds.", "Even if the story were true, the film's events have been fictionalized beyond belief.", "", "", "", "[It's] so careful about being inoffensive that it never has the guts to suggest much of anything except 'Be Nice to Others and Especially to Horses.'", "", "Will Hidalgo survive the brutal desert to demand more creative control over his next film?", "Fitfully entertaining hokum as long as it isn't taken too seriously&#133; Remarkably, Disney doesn't whitewash the more politically incorrect elements of Hopkins' tale.", "This is grand cowboy fun, a wild adventure with a glorious sense of excitement and wonder.", "...why weren't the Disney folks content simply to tell a good story? Could it have been because they knew they didn't have a very good story?", "The film's most harrowing scenes are predictable and utterly unoriginal."], "rating": ["2/5", "", "", "2/4", "3/5", "", "3/5", "3/5", "2/4", "2/4", "C", "2/5", "3/5", "C", "3/10", "2/4", "C+", "5/5", "5/10", "1.5/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Kaleem Aftab", "Mark Steyn", "Antonia Quirke", "David Nusair", "Kevin Carr", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Nell Minow", "Mark Halverson", "Kam Williams", "Russ Breimeier", "Brian Orndorf", "", "Garth Franklin", "Jeffrey Overstreet", "Tony Medley", "Mark Collette", "Steven D.
