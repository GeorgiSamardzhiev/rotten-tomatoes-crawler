Then Moses (Mel Brooks) receives the tablets containing the \"15\" commandments, and Emperor Nero (Dom DeLuise) presides over a madcap Rome with his wife, Nympho (Madeline Kahn). Jumping ahead, the Spanish Inquisition softens repression with song and dance, and a few centuries later Madame Defarge (Cloris Leachman) is fomenting revolution in France.", "rating": "58", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Mel Brooks", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 24, 2020", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["As written and directed by Brooks, the movie's overreliance on sex, scat and Semitic jokes wears painfully thin halfway through the picture.", "What [Brooks] takes to be the glorious folk humor that modern people have repressed looks to many of us like the tired jokes that were yawned off the burlesque stage 50 years ago.", "History of the World, Part I-which has no sequel-spoofs multiple genres in this anthology showing that there are no limits to the mind of writer-director Mel Brooks.", "Mel Brooks's movie History of the World, Part 1 is a rambling, undisciplined, sometimes embarrassing failure from one of the most gifted comic filmmakers around.", "... an entertaining mishmash of skits which finds Mel Brooks back in lively form, both for better and for worse.", "Dirty jokes, some sparkle in uneven Mel Brooks classic.", "Hearing some of those old, beloved one-liners again made me smile, but they did not have the power to make me laugh anew.", "Brooks' fractured History is salvaged by the tuneful 'Inquisition.'", "", "", "Brooks proved that increasing the vulgarity level doesn't necessarily translate into more laughs.
