{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Robert Neville (Will Smith), a brilliant scientist, is a survivor of a man-made plague that transforms humans into bloodthirsty mutants. He wanders alone through New York City, calling out for other possible survivors, and works on finding a cure for the plague using his own immune blood. Neville knows he is badly outnumbered and the odds are against him, and all the while, the infected wait for him to make a mistake that will deliver Neville into their hands.", "rating": "68", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Francis Lawrence", "studio": "WeedRoadPictures,VillageRoadshowPictures,OverbrookEntertainment", "theater_date": "Dec 14, 2007", "dvd_date": "Dec 1, 2009", "box_office": "$256.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A lot has been left to the imagination, especially during the adaptation of the novel, from which the film deviates so greatly that taking its title was far from necessary.", "A frightening, confronting and totally immersive action picture.", "The screenplay from previous Oscar-winner Akiva Goldsman and Mark Protosevich is a disappointingly convoluted script that lacks clarity and purpose.", "Nothing is scarier than Francis Lawrence's direction. [Full review in Spanish]", "Smith is an appealing screen presence, but the film needs more than just that to stay alive.", "...the film's final act turn towards quick, out of nowhere resolutions, hokey attempts at evocations of faith, and a rapid increase of sentimental slop does much to undercut \"I Am Legend\"'s excellent, forlorn first half.", "If you ignore its flaws, I am Legend can be enjoyed as the perfect brainless Boxing Day blockbuster - but it is essentially a leftover festive turkey.", "", "", "It's a better-than-average blockbuster, which sweeps around some large ideas and interesting themes, but never delves for long enough to make this film a true classic.", "Inevitably, ideas give way to special-effects", "I Am Legend is three film genres for the price of one: Science Fiction, Action, and Horror, and while it's no classic in any one arena it remains edgy fun.", "This is no graphic shoot-'em-up but an intelligent, if sometimes sentimental, exploration of human decency and responsibility that ponders the limits of rationality and faith.", "There are some good points, but there are too many ineffectual aspects that keep I Am Legend from being the sophisticated film it was clearly meant to be.", "Smith turns in a terrific performance, nailing Neville's angst while allowing room for humor.", "Smith still manages to find something touching and occasionally even tragic in the character.", "For everything that is good about it, though, I Am Legend struggles against two primary problems.", "It left me highly entertained, since out of the original story the filmmakers have created a different, but exciting and tense story filled with action, suspense and a lead character you can truly care about.", "The movie is simply okay. Not awful, not great.
