[Full review in Spanish]", "Penn and Hirsch test our patience with a time-tripping style of cinema that mixes fiction and nonfiction narrative styles, physical and emotional nudity, facial hair and hard-to-watch hunting scenes.", "Into the Wild captures the recklessness, the passion, and also the cruelty of youth.", "This is a film that is full of life, showing how much living the young man did in his short time on earth, yet it's laced with the tragic realization that his life was somewhat wasted.", "A masterpiece; a rapturous, quintessential American odyssey that earns its place in the pantheon of the great \"road\" films and at the pinnacle of this year's very best.", "Penn's direction intuitively acts as a spiritual proxy for McCandless' own rapturous way that he processes his journey.", "Sean Penn's adaptation of Jon Krakauer's non-fiction book is a bracing cinematic plunge into the odyssey of Christopher McCandless.", "", "", "Every once in awhile, a movie will come outta nowhere and blow your socks off.", "Crafting his meditation on the men who answer the call of the wild, Sean Penn's adaptation is heavy on mood and ambiance but sadly lacking in depth, giving up on the wider comparisons to focus fully on McCandless, who may not be up to the scrutiny.", "It's a bit heavy-handed, but ultimately a rewarding watch.", "Even in its harrowing final moments, it reaches a spiritually transcendent pinnacle - the idea of ending one long, strange trip and plummeting into an even-greater unknown with both fear and elation. A stirring American drama of comfort and conflict.", "An uplifting and enriching cautionary tale about one man's spiritual adventure on the road and in the wilderness.", "Even Penn's more indulgent flourishes seem to enhance the film's keen feeling.", "Penn's film displays a deep and abiding love for America, set against a critique of the uglier aspects that exist alongside all that the beauty.", "The kind of insipid hero-worship that traps the subject in wax", "Thank goodness for Eric Gautier&rsquo;s miracle of cinematography that floods the screen with spectacular moments of pristine beauty and long shots ...", "A long trip, but worth the wait.
