{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Born into poverty and raised in a brothel, \u00c9dith Piaf (Marion Cotillard) manages to achieve worldwide fame.

That's why they love Leonard Cohen, Bud Powell, and Jim Thompson.", "No regrets for Cottilard's dedication, but plenty for the clich\u00e9d pap of the biopic genre", "In La Vie en Rose, Marion Cotillard has the role of a lifetime. And she relishes it.", "", "Quite simply, is the best movie I have seen all year.", "", "Marion Cotillard's Oscar win? Totally justified...Many questions remain for those of us unschooled in Piaf lore. I was confused by some of the causes even as I felt the emotional effects, thanks to deep performances.", "Much like the colorful life of the film's subject, La Vie en Rose explores the strange and emotional life of torch singer Edith Piaf and gives Marion Cotillard an Oscar for her tremendous performance.", "Cotillard joins Ben Kingsley (Gandhi) and Forest Whitaker (The Last King of Scotland) in so completely embodying a role that it seems more possession than performance.", "Here is what made the woman tick, if you need facts, find them in a book, if you want to understand her soul, see this film", "Acaba funcionando mais como atestado do talento de sua protagonista, Marion Cotillard, do que como um tributo digno da magn\u00edfica cantora que esta interpreta.", "This isn't the first time Piaf's life has been brought to the screen and it probably won't be the last, but Cotillard makes this particular version stand apart."], "rating": ["", "", "4/5", "", "3.5/4", "2/5", "4/5", "", "", "", "3.0/5", "2.5/4", "1", "3/5", "4/5", "3/4", "7/10", "5/5", "3/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "David Lamble", "Leigh Paatsch", "Felicia Feaster", "Matthew Lucas", "Ben Kenigsberg", "Melissa Anderson", "Jon Frosch", "Kelly Vance", "Fernando F.
