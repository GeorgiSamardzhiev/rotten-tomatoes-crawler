[Full Review in Spanish]", "One of Fassbinder's most dazzling efforts.", "Fassbinder's energy and imagination, in tandem creating strong, visceral images, justify and vindicate his excesses. He is, simply, one of very few directors in the world today who seems to be pouring everything he has into his medium.", "Fassbinder repeatedly depicts the song comforting lonely soldiers and then accompanying scenes of carnage. The devastating effect boomerangs.", "Fassbinder at half speed is still good, but this film... is still a disappointment.", "What is new for a Fassbinder work is that the film is far more entertaining to watch than it is interesting to speculate about. That means it's a disappointment.", "Though Fassbinder's camerawork is excellent, including some allusions to the famous German studio UFA, his themes are never really developed.", "The meanings are banal and the pace is heavy, but Fassbinder's use of color -- as throughout his late period -- is superb.", "It has a wicked sense of humor, displayed in Fassbinder's two favorite opposites, understatement and hyperbole.", "Elaborate proof that the devil really does have all the best tunes.", "It's the kind of love story Hollywood wishes it could make."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "2/5", "2/4", "", "3/4", "", "A"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos", "Andrew Parker", "Bruce McCabe", "Gary Arnold", "People Staff", "Vincent Canby", "", "Dave Kehr", "Roger Ebert", "Paul Taylor", "Dennis Schwartz"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Gate", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Globe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Sun-Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews"], "date": ["August 20, 2019", "August 28, 2018", "April 26, 2018", "August 4, 2015", "August 3, 2015", "September 18, 2006", "September 18, 2006", "June 3, 2006", "June 3, 2006", "June 3, 2006", "June 2, 2006"]}}
