{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The Hoover family -- a man (Greg Kinnear), his wife (Toni Collette), an uncle (Steve Carell), a brother (Paul Dano) and a grandfather (Alan Arkin) -- puts the fun back in dysfunctional by piling into a VW bus and heading to California to support a daughter (Abigail Breslin) in her bid to win the Little Miss Sunshine Contest.

You barely notice you're being manipulated.", "Sentimental low points and contrived idiosyncrasies aside, Little Miss Sunshine still boasts wonderful performances, a cheeky sense of humor and an original story.", "An achingly deliberately madcap family adventure that skates by thinly on the collective charms of its ensemble cast.", "While the screenplay is impressive and deserving of its recognition, it is Alan Arkin's performance-of-a-lifetime that separates this from other well-written small movies.", "Harmless enough as passable road movies go, but I can't help but wish directors of films like these would grow some damn balls.", "Sundance-calibrated sitcom", "I loved it, every bit of it.", "Like little kids spouting dirty words in certain comedies, this film from first-time directors Jonathan Dayton and Valerie Faris undermines the subversive with the self-conscious.
