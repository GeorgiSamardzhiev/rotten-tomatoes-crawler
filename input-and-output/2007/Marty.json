It's as if they were both getting something off their chests, pouring their lonely hearts into this film as if their very lives depended on it.", "Based on Paddy Chayefsky's prize-winning television play of the same name, it is a down-to-earth human-interest drama that is sure to have wide appeal, for it is a portrayal of life as it really is and as it is understood by the great mass of people.", "It is not, as we were led to expect, the very best film ever to be fabricated by anyone anywhere, but is an above-average picture made appealing by the charm of its story and the sensitive talents of its actors.", "Marty, in detail a study of life in the Bronx, is in essence a contemporary love story, a romantic encounter developed with charm, humour and emotional penetration.", "The emergence of this humane and perceptive film and its vast public acceptance during a year of continuing wide-screen frenzy has given a healthy indication that both the industry and the public can still respond to the better things.", "Going to the dogs in fine style", "It is a sentimental, heart-warming, simple story of a couple of ugly ducklings who find compensation for their lack of good looks in each other's love.", "Audiences used to seeing Borgnine in more menacing roles in films such as From Here to Eternity and Bad Day at Black Rock warmed to his sympathetic portrayal of the Bronx butcher with low self-esteem.", "As the loveable, plain-talking lug, Borgnine showed an acting depth not hinted at in previous villain roles.", "[Rod] Steiger's body language communicate not just his loneliness but his resignation to living out his life as \"a fat, ugly little man.\"", "Ernest Borgnine as Marty lives up to all the promise he showed as the sadist in From Here to Eternity, and at the same time brilliantly shatters the type-cast he molded for himself in that picture.", "Enormously influential, it spawned Hollywood's interest in smaller scale, prosaic dramas, few of which failed to match its resonance.", "Chayevsky's TV drama transferred effortlessly to cinema.", "It's a warm, human, sometimes sentimental and an enjoyable experience.", "Dowdy but winning and poignant.", "Paddy Chayevsky's script, adapted from his own TV play, shows his flair for dialogue at its best, and the film manages to be touching, if minor."], "rating": ["4/10", "3.5/5", "", "3.5/4", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "3/4", "5/5", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "4/4", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Michael J.
