{"metadata": {"synopsis": "As teenage skateboarder Alex (Gabe Nevins) hops freight trains with a stranger named Scratch (Daniel Liu), a security guard spots them and tries to forcibly remove them. In the scuffle, Alex strikes the guard with his skateboard, knocking him in the direction of another train, which kills him. Alex tosses his board into the river, but soon he and other skaters are called in for questioning by Detective Lu about a recovered skateboard that has been linked to the scene of the crime.", "rating": "77", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 24m", "director": "Gus Van Sant", "studio": "", "theater_date": "Mar 7, 2008", "dvd_date": "Mar 13, 2017", "box_office": "$486.0K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Van Sant retains the lovely insider's perspective of floating on the surface of an alien if familiar-looking planet, courtesy of one-time Wong Kar Wai cinematographer Christopher Doyle.", "Captures the essence of high school life better than most teen movies could ever dream.", "This is easily Van Sant's most satisfying film of his recent youth alienation pictures.", "Glum yet gorgeous, Paranoid Park ties together Alex's bleak confusion with his more mundane existential teen traumas.", "...\"Paranoid Park\" nevertheless gets into the headspace of its young high school skater protagonist and treats with supreme respect what might be best described as a blown mind.", "Even when I was trying to appear indifferent I was still boiling inside and horrified by everything around me. I don't see that in Van Sant's teenagers; I don't recognize them.", "Too brief and good-looking to actively dislike, Paranoid Park is still uninspiringly repetitive.
