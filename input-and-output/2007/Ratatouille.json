{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Remy (Patton Oswalt), a resident of Paris, appreciates good food and has quite a sophisticated palate. He would love to become a chef so he can create and enjoy culinary masterpieces to his heart's delight. The only problem is, Remy is a rat. When he winds up in the sewer beneath one of Paris' finest restaurants, the rodent gourmet finds himself ideally placed to realize his dream.", "rating": "96", "genre": "Animation/Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Brad Bird", "studio": "PixarAnimationStudios", "theater_date": "Jun 29, 2007", "dvd_date": "Nov 23, 2015", "box_office": "$206.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Despite the unexplained language barriers or farfetched plot, this delightfully delicious foray into the unimaginable never becomes preachy or immature.", "This is a film about a rat who becomes a chef in Paris. But it's so much more than that. It's about what a great artist can be, where a great artist can come from, it's about food and how to savour it.", "A love letter to Paris, a valentine to the fine art of cooking, and a gift to film fans of all ages.", "A delectable treat that represents the finest qualities in animation and American cinema.", "Has great vocal performances throughout and is about a character figuring out where they belong and finally being accepted there. I love it!", "That is the (...) imperative message of Ratatouille. Everyone is not an artist, but anyone could be an artist. Because, as living creatures, it is simply what we do.", "The studio's latest effort offers beautiful and strikingly realistic animation, but the flawed concept should have been scrapped...", "I won't spoil the broth, but suffice to say Ratatouille is a bursting with bright flavors, some spice, and deep warmth that settles in your belly and satisfies body and soul.", "There is so much to enjoy and celebrate here, Ratatouille deserves more than a review: it could (and probably will) inspire books about creativity and good taste.", "Ratatouille was written and directed by Brad Bird, the guy behind The Incredibles, and while his new movie isn't as brainy as that one, it has lots of lovely touches to appeal to parents as well as kids.", "Ratatouille is a triumph that not only pays tribute to the spirit of discovery, but revels in the fun of making a few of its own.", "And there's Remy himself, voiced by irreverent comic Patton Oswalt. Yes, he's a rat, and a pantless one at that, but he's a charming rat.", "The latest from Pixar and Oscar winning writer-director Brad Bird is a fabulously enjoyable parable about the pursuit of excellence and rising above the preconceptions of others.", "It's not just the best animated film this year, it's the best animated film to come out of the U.S. since Bird's last effort, The Incredibles.", "Like the snooty restaurant critic Anton Ego (voiced by Peter O'Toole), we enter Ratatouille thinking we've tasted it all, and we leave hoping for seconds.", "It's a great programme for all the family.", "It's not my favourite Pixar film.", "No restaurant has ever benefited from placing rats in a recipe, but the digital wizards in Pixar's kitchen have cooked up a winning peasant dish in Ratatouille.", "Ratatouille is a wonderful, wistful comedy, and a sparkling return to form for the computer animation studio Pixar after last year's lacklustre Cars.", "As in his previous films, Bird offers up a story with substance."], "rating": ["8/10", "", "3.5/4", "4/4", "A+", "", "", "", "A", "4/5", "7.5/10", "3/4", "4/5", "", "3.5/4", "4/5", "3/5", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Anupama Chopra", "Matt Brunson", "Matthew Lucas", "Rachel Wagner", "Emily Asher-Perrin", "Brandy McDonnell", "Dorothy Woodend", "Jeffrey Overstreet", "Deirdre Swain", "Todd Gilchrist", "Mike Scott", "Mike Davies", "AP Kryza", "Kim Brown", "David Stratton", "Margaret Pomeranz", "Katherine Monk", "Ryan Gilbey", "Tim Basham"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Companion", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Frenzy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tor.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Oklahoman", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Tyee (British Columbia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Looking Closer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">NOW Toronto", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IGN Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times-Picayune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Birmingham Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Willamette Week", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">At the Movies (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">At the Movies (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Canada.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Statesman", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Paste Magazine"], "date": ["November 27, 2020", "May 18, 2020", "June 20, 2019", "June 6, 2019", "April 26, 2019", "January 14, 2019", "August 8, 2018", "August 23, 2017", "December 8, 2015", "August 3, 2015", "August 3, 2015", "August 3, 2015", "August 3, 2015", "August 3, 2015", "August 3, 2015", "July 29, 2015", "July 29, 2015", "August 24, 2014", "August 24, 2014", "August 24, 2014"]}}
