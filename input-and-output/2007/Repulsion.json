{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In Roman Polanski's first English-language film, beautiful young manicurist Carole (Catherine Deneuve) suffers from androphobia (the pathological fear of interaction with men). When her sister and roommate, Helen (Yvonne Furneaux), leaves their London flat to go on an Italian holiday with her married boyfriend (Ian Hendry), Carole withdraws into her apartment. She begins to experience frightful hallucinations, her fear gradually mutating into madness.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Roman Polanski", "studio": "ComptonFilms,Tekli", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 2, 2014", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The rest of the film has that gurgling, soapy sound of muffed intentions going down the plug hole like bath water.", "Were we supposed to have found it entertaining? There's more horror latent in this notion of the movie audience than in the film itself.", "The purest exercise in homicidal mania yet made, and the most singleminded.", "Repulsion is far more shocking, in fact, than anything Hitchcock ever made, because it can produce in the spectator the added shock of self-recognition, the hallmark of a real artwork.", "How much one remains held by all this probably depends on how much one is interested by the case-book aspect of Carol's story, but at least there are ample visual compensations.", "The young Catherine Deneuve (she was 22 at the time of filming) gives a performance so unsettling and so precise, I can barely believe she grew into such a confident screen presence.", "Roman Polanski takes us on a deeply disturbing, hallucinatory trip into Catherine Deneuve's mental breakdown in this British psychological thriller,", "Deneuve gives an astonishing, clinically accurate performance ...", "Deneuve, as the woman whose fear of sexual contact is at the base of her neurosis, has seldom been less like her icy self.", "A film that expertly shows without ever telling, even while the symbolism is a mite heavy handed.", "There can't be many other films which so plausibly show an entire, warped world created from a single point of view.", "Polanski makes us psyche-cine intruders, able to come and go as we please. It is this that makes the film so unsettling and perversely enigmatic.", "It's been an inspiration ever since for films about claustrophobic hysteria, but not necessarily in a good way ...", "Filled with indelible images and punishing sound design, Repulsion casts a shadow over everything from Eraserhead to Black Swan, but there's nothing quite like the real thing.", "A peerless Freudian nightmare, frequently revisited but seldom matched in its desire and terror, its visual-aural flow, and its queasy voyeuristic pleasure in seeing a frosty princess picking at her own skin", "Repulsion is a masterpiece of horror that is not to be missed and can be open to many interpretations.", "As psychological horror films go, there are more than a few that get the psychology better than this, but almost none that come within spitting distance of the horror.", "You may feel the urge to laugh out of sheer need to break the tension, and Polanski knows it.", "Its ability to conjure monsters from its heroine's id remains unparalleled.", "Repulsion wastes no time before plunging its audience into the frighteningly disturbed mindset of its central character."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "4.5/5", "5/5", "", "4/5", "4/5", "5/5", "", "3/5", "5/5", "", "1", "9/10", "5/5", "5/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Peter John Dyer", "Pauline Kael", "Dwight MacDonald", "Wendy Michener", "MFB Critics", "Simon Miraudo", "Tom Hutchinson", "Philip French", "Derek Malcolm", "David Jenkins", "Peter Bradshaw", "Nicola Woodham", "Tim Robey", "Andrew Lowry", "Fernando F.
