{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The year is 2018 in a futuristic society where corporations have replaced countries.

Rollerball is first and foremost, a good movie. It has strong characters, a good plot, and lots of action. It is also a social commentary.", "A science fiction masterpiece and exciting action film.", "Director Norman Jewison has far more luck with his staging of the Rollerball matches (they're at once exciting and horrifying) than scripter William Harrison has in condemning this futureworld with anything more than boilerplate lip service.", "With its sluggish pacing, Rollerball gradually loses momentum between its slickly constructed game sequences", "Inside the arena, it's a fantastic action movie, but outside, it's starchy and pretentious.", "James Caan, on roller skates, is trying to save the world. This needs a bit of explaining, which is only the beginning of the trouble with Rollerball.", "Norman Jewison's sensational futuristic drama about a world of Corporate States stars James Caan in an excellent performance as a famed athlete who fights for his identity and free will.", "Seems to being going around in circles trying to say something but is not sure about what it wants to say, as it keeps stumbling around every bend.", "The performances of Caan and Richardson are excellent, and the rollerball sequences are fast-paced and interesting.", "Lifeless, uninspired, and crammed with enough hints of intellectual consistency to give the socially conscious critical establishment shivers of excitement.", "", "This original version could EASILY have been trimmed down quite some with plenty of repetitive moments popping up throughout the film.", "Ultimately, Rollerball gets by on its sheer monolithic quality - an abundance of quantity. Despite indifferent direction and dire humour, it is well mounted and photographed.", "It seems pretty prescient about violence, corporations, and TV.", "", "", "", "Everyone else, including Mr. Caan and John Houseman, who plays a leading Houston executive, is more solemn and serious than the movie ever merits."], "rating": ["", "", "8/10", "", "2.5/4", "2/5", "4/5", "", "", "C", "3/4", "", "4/5", "5/10", "", "3/5", "2/5", "4/5", "2/5", "1.5/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Ruth Batchelor", "Eric Hynes", "Rick Sanchez", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Matt Brunson", "Philip Concannon", "", "Jay Cocks", "Variety Staff", "Dennis Schwartz", "", "Don Druker", "Cole Smithey", "JoBlo", "Geoff Andrew", "Brad Laidman", "Jules Brenner", "Randy Shulman", "Emanuel Levy", "Vincent Canby"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Free Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rolling Stone", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IGN Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Skinny", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">JoBlo&#39;s Movie Network", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Signals", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro Weekly (Washington, DC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times"], "date": ["November 27, 2019", "May 30, 2018", "May 30, 2018", "April 22, 2017", "June 25, 2016", "March 31, 2015", "August 5, 2008", "August 4, 2008", "August 4, 2008", "January 24, 2008", "June 5, 2007", "June 5, 2007", "November 19, 2006", "June 24, 2006", "February 9, 2006", "December 6, 2005", "July 29, 2005", "July 22, 2005", "June 19, 2005", "May 9, 2005"]}}
