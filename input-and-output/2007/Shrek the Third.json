{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When King Harold suddenly croaks, Shrek (Mike Myers) learns he will have to rule the land of Far, Far Away, unless he can find a suitable heir to the throne. The most-promising candidate is Princess Fiona's (Cameron Diaz) cousin Artie (Justin Timberlake), a teenage slacker in a medieval high-school. Shrek and his trusted companions, Donkey (Eddie Murphy) and Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas), set out to bring Artie back but find their mission is a bigger challenge than they expected.", "rating": "42", "genre": "Animation/Comedy/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Chris Miller", "studio": "DreamWorksSKG", "theater_date": "May 18, 2007", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$320.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Technically and visually, the Shrek features continue to advance.", "A satisfying sequel that has its charm but isn't quite up to par with its predecessors.", "For Shrek The Third, the third time's a charm.", "An agreeable time-passer, nothing more.", "[An] incredibly boring movie with unpleasant characters and a tired, played out story.", "The first two movies had heart, charm, wit, originality, parfait and, most unusually for an animation, characters you could properly care about. This, though, has very little of any of the above, and it breaks my heart.", "The comic actresses deftly turn the Disney animated standard of helpless and lovely damsels in distress on its head.", "", "With a plot lacking no urgency, Shrek 3 is a well-animated film containing a few standout, but ultimately throwaway sequences that don't do enough to sustain our interest.", "Computer-animated ugliness", "From its humble, elegant origins as a slim children's book by William Steig, Shrek has metastasized into a symptom of and metaphor for the entertainment industry and modern culture in general.", "Shrek the Third has the curse of the third in a bankable series. It is too often sappy, tiresome, and overblown. A franchise such as Shrek, with all the money it has accumulated, should be able to buy a little freshness and originality. But instead", "Apart from some modestly amusing princess shtick and a pleasantly slapsticky opening, there's no real reason for anyone over the age of 11 to see this one.", "The best thing it has going for it is its look, which is stunning.", "Though the devious wit of the original remains, it is obscured by too many classic-rock interludes (courtesy of Led Zeppelin, Heart and Paul McCartney) and nudging pop-culture references that seem by now just part of the formula.", "This is a very skillfully made corporate product, but I wonder who, exactly, will be fully satisfied.", "The problem with this film is that after a quick, fun beginning they repeat a similar journey from the first film. Except this time, Shrek and Artie argue instead of Shrek and Fiona.", "Your kids may enjoy it, but you would do better to wait for the video.", "Feels refreshed and might be -- especially for relieved parents -- the most entertaining film of the franchise.", "While there are times of moderate amusement, Shrek the Third offers few surprises. It seems as though perhaps the creators have found their stride and are calling it in more than going out on a limb."], "rating": ["7/10", "B", "", "2.5/4", "D", "", "3/4", "3/5", "2/5", "", "1/4", "2.0/5", "", "5/10", "2.5/4", "", "5/10", "", "B", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Micheal Compton", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Matthew Lucas", "Rachel Wagner", "Deborah Ross", "Brandy McDonnell", "Hank Sartin", "Tony Delgado", "Fernando F.
