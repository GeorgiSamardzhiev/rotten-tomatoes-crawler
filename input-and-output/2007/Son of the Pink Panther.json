{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When Princess Yasmin (Debrah Farentino) of the kingdom of Lugash is kidnapped by Hans Zarba (Robert Davi), Police Commissioner Charles Dreyfus (Herbert Lom) comes to Nice, France, to supervise the rescue effort. Clumsy policeman Jacques Gambrelli (Roberto Benigni) is assigned to assist him -- and Dreyfus is appalled to learn Jacques is the illegitimate son of his old nemesis, the late Inspector Clouseau.

Is there anybody out there who would want to see it? More to the point, would Edwards want to make it?", "What's missing? Zest, creativity, density, paprika, astonishment, speed. Most of all: speed. Slapstick is like basketball -- if it doesn't happen fast, it doesn't happen.", "This movie will finally kill off the series.", "That there are any laughs at all is due almost entirely to Benigni. He's not remotely like Sellers, but he's a creative physical comedian.", "To be fair, Benigni does the best he can with the supremely unfunny material.", "Stay away at all costs. Do not be lulled by nostalgic memories of Inspector Clouseau's malapropisms; do not be fooled by slick print or TV ads; do not let your kids talk you into it.", "Each new installment has become like a visit with old friends who are often annoying and frequently boring, but are missed in some strange way when they're not around.", "Counting the animated TV show, this is the Panther's ninth life. Color him dead.", "The kidnapping plot is inane, the slapstick inept and the cast ineffectual. All in all, mind-bogglingly bad.", "Each routine was done better -- and funnier -- long ago by Sellers. Gags about getting drunk, mispronouncing words, dressing up in disguises, executing pratfalls and other inane physical bits have become old and tired.", "Some kids might like so-so Pink Panther.", "Outside of the James Bond films, it's hard to think of a series as pass as Blake Edwards' Pink Panther comedies.", "Starring Italian comedian Roberto Benigni as the new bumbling inspector, it is a tired pastiche of recycled sketches and gags.", "", "never does it get any more amusing than someone falling down, falling out of a window, or falling off of a bed", "Delivers a surprising amount of laughs.
