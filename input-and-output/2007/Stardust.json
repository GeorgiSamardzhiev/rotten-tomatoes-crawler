{"metadata": {"synopsis": "To win the heart of his beloved (Sienna Miller), a young man named Tristan (Charlie Cox) ventures into the realm of fairies to retrieve a fallen star. What Tristan finds, however, is not a chunk of space rock, but a woman (Claire Danes) named Yvaine. Yvaine is in great danger, for the king's sons need her powers to secure the throne, and an evil witch (Michelle Pfeiffer) wants to use her to achieve eternal youth and beauty.", "rating": "76", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 8m", "director": "Matthew Vaughn", "studio": "ParamountPictures,IngeniousFilmPartners,DiBonaventuraPictures", "theater_date": "Aug 10, 2007", "dvd_date": "Jun 6, 2014", "box_office": "$38.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Brings an emphatically welcome revisit to the science-fiction-infused fantasy subgenre.", "...frightened, bewildered, and just plain crabby...", "Bright, breezy and utterly charming.", "Stardust is a movie for people who like comedy, sword fights, unlikely friends, transformations, personal discovery and above all, love.", "This lively fantasy-comedy (from the same creative team that went on to give us the Kick-Ass and Kingsman movies!) gets better as it goes along, calling on a dryness of wit and slyness of spirit that brings to mind... The Princess Bride.", "While Stardust might not be a good choice for a family outing, it's not a bad choice for date night.", "This is utterly formulaic. True, there are a few jokes, but as they are all extraordinarily lame, this can't be called a send-up.", "The movie boasts a stellar cast, even in the smallest roles, and they play their parts with gusto. Stardust has a sense of whimsy and quirky humor missing from many fantasy hits.", "", "", "This star is not as much of a beauty as it could have been.", "The oddball elements may surprise viewers expecting something a bit more ordinary in approach, but the surprise should be a pleasant one.", "There was just enough connection between Claire Danes and Charlie Cox that happily ever after is exactly what I wanted.", "Stardust is nothing short of pure magic.", "On the surface, Stardust looks like a cheesy little fluff fantasy. In many ways it is. Yet at the same time, it's also the most fun I've had with a film since watching the first Pirates of the Caribbean.", "Primo contempor\u00e2neo de A Princesa Prometida, o filme tamb\u00e9m traz refer\u00eancias \u00f3bvias a Macbeth e Rei Lear em sua agitada trama, revelando um senso de humor eficaz e com toques sombrios que o transformam em uma mais do que bem-vinda surpresa.", "Like the star that falls to Earth near the beginning of the movie, Stardust is glittery and pretty and possesses its own pleasing-enough personality, but it won't set the world on fire.", "Stardust is, ultimately, a pretty entertaining movie. It's just not the great film that it so easily could have been.", "...charming and enchanting and adventurous and romantic and funny and hugely entertaining.", "There's plenty of action and comedy, but Stardust is ultimately about true love. As with many fairytales, there's no point in worrying about plot details, and it's best enjoyed for its simple entertainment value."], "rating": ["9/10", "", "4/5", "", "3.5/5", "", "", "3.5/4", "3/5", "3/5", "5/10", "", "7/10", "7/10", "", "4/5", "", "", "8/10", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Kathi Maio", "Nikki Baughan", "Emily Asher-Perrin", "Leigh Paatsch", "Megan Basham", "Deborah Ross", "Brandy McDonnell", "Hank Sartin", "Joshua Rothkopf", "JimmyO", "Steve Biodrowski", "Jeff Bayer", "Brandon Fibbs", "Ryan Cracknell", "Pablo Villa\u00e7a", "Mark Bourne", "Felix Gonzalez Jr.", "John J.
