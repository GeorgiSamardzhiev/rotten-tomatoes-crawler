Far from Wayne's best, but nevertheless a movie whose ending ignites a heated discussion.", "A forgotten masterpiece.", "Even with a closing that breaks with tradition, The Cowboys is not as eventful as one would have hoped for in a John Wayne movie.", "At the center of this picture, just as in Red River, is the passing of the Western mores and masculinity code from John Wayne to the younger generation.
