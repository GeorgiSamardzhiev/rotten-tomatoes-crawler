{"metadata": {"synopsis": "John (David Bowie) is the lover of the gorgeous immortal vampire Miriam (Catherine Deneuve), and he's been led to believe that he'll live forever, too. Unfortunately, he quickly deteriorates into a horrible living death, and Miriam seeks a new companion. She soon sets her sights on Sarah (Susan Sarandon), a lovely young scientist, who quickly falls under Miriam's spell. However, Sarah doesn't warm up to the concept of vampirism easily, leading to conflict with Miriam.", "rating": "55", "genre": "Horror", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Tony Scott", "studio": "MetroGoldwynMayer,PeerfordLtd.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The film's enduring quality is its ineffable coolness, which feels inextricable from Scott's supposedly lowbrow music video origins.", "Moody, elegant, and undeniably cool, The Hunger stands alongside the likes of Daughters of Darkness as one of the best artistic cinematic representations of the vampire ever made.", "With style and a proper helping of eroticism and blood, The Hunger gnashes its way by the teeth into that upper echelon, the pantheon of great vampire movies.", "We know that the hunger of the title isn&#146;t just a hunger for blood, it&#146;s a hunger to hold on to life, to love, to all of those moments that make us what we are, in that brief period of our lives that we shine, when we are at our best.", "A film with legendary cast and photograph. Underestimated at the time, but like any other cult movies, was able to find its audience. [Full review in Spanish]", "As good a horror film in the most pure, rarefied sense of \"horror\" that the '80s produced in English.", "Vampire movies were always cool, but it took The Hunger to make them modern.", "Bloody lesbian-vampire story is stylish, but no Twilight.", "The focus of Hunger is emphatically the death of Bobby Sands, specifically, what happens to his body, viewed from a tragic outside and, to an imaginative extent, a determined inside.", "More style than substance, and perhaps simply an excuse to get Denueve and Susan Sarandon, Miriam's post-Bowie love, in bed together.", "A slick, largely empty visual exercise with vague thematic overtones about a clash between American and European culture.", "In his feature debut, director Tony Scott, brother of Ridley, exhibits the same penchant for eleborate art direction, minimal, humorless dialog and shooting in smoky rooms.", "Deneuve and Sarandon are something else.", "Visual sensualities will have a feast, but you'll have to read Whitley Strieber's novel if you don't want to emerge with a badly scratched head.", "", "", "", "Nearly unwatchable lesbian vampire flick.", "The Hunger is an agonizingly bad vampire movie, circling around an exquisitely effective sex scene.
