{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Rose (Bette Midler) is a passionate 1960s rock star who pours herself into every performance despite her demanding manager, Rudge (Alan Bates), who encourages her to tour excessively. While singing is her greatest love, the rock 'n' roll lifestyle takes its toll as Rose succumbs to drug and alcohol abuse. Only Rose's kind-hearted boyfriend, Dyer (Frederic Forrest), tries to save her from falling victim to her own success in this drama loosely based on the life of Janis Joplin.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "2h 14m", "director": "Mark Rydell", "studio": "TwentiethCenturyFox", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 1, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Script and direction are terrible, but as the booze-guzzling, lonely, foulmouthed rock star with a baroque sense of fun (aka Janis Joplin), Bette Midler is terrific.", "The story is well-written and executed, with the use of a contemporary informal language. Bette Midler is outstanding. [Full Review in Spanish]", "It's impossible to watch this peculiarly unstirring account of the collapse of a bedraggled, bedrugged rock star... without getting many a giggle out of the abundant cliches and superfluous howlers.", "Bette Midler's turn as the self-destructive yet sympathetic Rose is a tour de force, and there are nice contributions from Frederic Forrest and, in one powerhouse scene, Harry Dean Stanton.", "Were it not a fictional feature film, The Rose might very well be considered one of the best concert documentaries of the 1970s.", "The Rose isn't big but enormous.", "The Rose wouldn't work without the full commitment of Midler, who always seems poised between a bawdy guffaw and thick mascara tears.", "", "", "", "A very compelling performance by Midler bolsters this musical biopic", "Simply riveting, Bette Midler gives a volcanic, Oscar-nominated performance in this loose adaptation of the tragic life of singer Janis Joplin.", "Powerful story, brilliant central performance", "For rock fans, this is pretty sacred stuff. It has its emotional moments.", "For all of the considerable heat [Midler] generates; she can't -- all by herself -- give The Rose what it most needs.
