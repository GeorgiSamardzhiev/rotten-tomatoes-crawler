[Full Review in Spanish]", "Shot in dazzling black and white, where the lights sparkle in the frame like the jewels that down Vernoika's neck.", "The acting, all around, is impeccable.", "Had Robert Altman not already employed the title 3 Women for his 1977 gem, that would have handily served as a header for Rainer Werner Fassbinder's acclaimed BRD Trilogy.", "It's a transfixing blend of old Hollywood, the Douglas Sirk-styled tropes Fassbinder adored so much, a powerful look at fading fame and addiction...", "Fassbinder's best film.", "Far from apprehending this effect as a felicitous esthetic touch, one simply gets the creeps from it. Veronika Voss is no doubt a peculiarly authentic last testament and premonition of oblivion, but there is no comfort or gratification in it.", "One of the most stylish of Fassbinder's many films.", "", "", "Fassbinder's visual style is the perfect match for this subject.", "A chilly, tough, wicked satire disguised as the sort of schmaltzy, black-and-white, 1950's melodrama.", "This was the last film that Rainer Werner Fassbinder completed before his suicide.", "Fassbinder's work here is muddy at best. His black and white cinematography limits his typically washed-out color palette while failing to connect us emotionally with the bygone era.", "The situation soon freezes into an inert, rather facile metaphor for America's postwar domination of the German soul."], "rating": ["7/10", "", "3/4", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "4/4", "4/5", "4/5", "4/4", "4.5/5", "B", "2/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Yasser Medina", "Diego Gal\u00e1n", "Matthew Lucas", "Camille Kittrell", "Matt Brunson", "Andrew Parker", "Michael Blowen", "Gary Arnold", "", "Emanuel Levy", "John Esther", "Roger Ebert", "Vincent Canby", "Dennis Schwartz", "Christopher Null", "Dave Kehr"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">From the Front Row", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sojourner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Frenzy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Gate", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Globe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Pasadena Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Sun-Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmcritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader"], "date": ["August 8, 2020", "August 23, 2019", "August 22, 2019", "August 20, 2019", "August 10, 2019", "August 28, 2018", "April 27, 2018", "August 4, 2015", "September 18, 2006", "July 7, 2005", "November 22, 2004", "October 23, 2004", "August 30, 2004", "September 27, 2003", "March 26, 2003", "January 1, 2000"]}}
