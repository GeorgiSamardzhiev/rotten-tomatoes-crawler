Buck Rogers reworked as a sex kitten in space for the 1960s culture of free love and pop art.", "Campy sci-fi cult classic features violence, nudity.", "A Flash Gordon-meets-Oz kitsch-fest stripping women's sexual revolution down to voyeuristic spectacle, flimsily dressed in cheap, see-through, psychedelic B-movie garb. Vadim imbues most scenes with a faux-arty lethargy that slumps into stiltedness.", "One of the most memorable of comic book adaptations ever conceived...", "Roger Vadim's ultra-kitsch sci-fi classic somehow improves with age.", "The campy Barbarella still glows...", "\"Barbarella\" is the 1968 sci-fi that made Jane Fonda a household name. The opening credits feature a striptease that takes Fonda from a cumbersome space suit to her birthday suit. Her sex kitten looks were enough to drive young men crazy.", "Barbarella couldn't exist in any era but the 1960s and its delightful over-the-top qualities find an ideal expression in the ridiculous excesses of the time.", "Clearly inspired by 1960s Batmania, the hunka hunka burning camp that is Barbarella adapted French science-fiction comic books into gleefully oversexed cinematic pop art. [Blu-ray]", "Without Jane Fonda, there isn't much to talk about. Yet with her, the film is enjoyable to watch, not only because she is so appealing to look at but because she has such a flair for the role.", "Emblematic of a freewheeling, free love culture that never really existed, it's a true camp classic, a unique amalgamation of pulp themes and a pseudo-historical treasure.", "Cheerfully catch-all.", "A kitsch cult classic.", "", "The film is ugly on so many levels -- from art direction to human values -- that it's hard to know where to begin.", "Most of this is soft-core nonsense, but snappy dialogue and design -- as well as the striptease routine that Fonda performs behind the opening credits -- have made it something of a cult favorite.", "Despite a certain amount of production dash and polish and a few silly-funny lines of dialog, Barbarella isn't very much of a film.", "I just couldn't take my eyes off the screen.", "Terry Southern's dialogue occasionally sparkles, and the imaginative designs, as shot by Claude Renoir, look really splendid."], "rating": ["2/10", "", "3/5", "", "", "4/5", "8", "B", "3/4", "3/4", "5/10", "3/5", "4/5", "", "3/5", "", "1/4", "", "8/10", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Sean Axmaker", "Tracy Moore", "Brian Gibson", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Dan Geary", "Philip Martin", "Paul Chambers", "Rob Vaux", "Peter Canavese", "John J.
