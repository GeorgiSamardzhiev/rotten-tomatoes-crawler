But it looks as if it speaks the truth and is considerably more entertaining and thought-provoking than most of the week's other offerings.", "It tails off into a confusing ending, but Bigga Than Ben is still honest, funny and provocative enough to wind up Daily Mail and Guardian readers alike.", "Where she's less sure is the disintegration of the friendship between Spiker and Cobakka. It's less than convincing and strangely unaffecting because - to be brutally honest - they're both a pair of neo-Nazi gits.", "Still, it's an enterprising little movie in its location shooting, and I warmed to it - an overeagerness to entertain is hardly the worst crime.", "Relentlessly crass, smug, charmless and unedifying.", "It's a depressing, grubby-looking little film with an undercurrent of particularly mean-spirited misogyny. You wonder what Suzie Halewood, the director, was thinking.", "What purports to be a rough guide, slyly but skilfully reveals itself to be a bit of a rough diamond.", "The performances are spiky, the use of varied locations is fresh and the dialogue - 'How could I ever imagine that I, a Moscow hooligan and Nazi would become a negro lover?' - is warmingly non-exemplary.", ""], "rating": ["3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "2/5", "", "1/5", "1/5", "3.5/5", "4/6", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Rich Cline", "Derek Malcolm", "Chris Hicks", "Tim Evans", "Tim Robey", "Peter Bradshaw", "Wendy Ide", "Matt Glasby", "Wally Hammond", "Matthew Turner"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Shadows on the Wall", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sky Cinema", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ViewLondon"], "date": ["October 10, 2008", "October 10, 2008", "October 10, 2008", "October 10, 2008", "October 10, 2008", "October 10, 2008", "October 10, 2008", "October 10, 2008", "October 10, 2008", "October 9, 2008"]}}
