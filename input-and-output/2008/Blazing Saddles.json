{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this satirical take on Westerns, crafty railroad worker Bart (Cleavon Little) becomes the first black sheriff of Rock Ridge, a frontier town about to be destroyed in order to make way for a new railroad. Initially, the people of Rock Ridge harbor a racial bias toward their new leader. However, they warm to him after realizing that Bart and his perpetually drunk gunfighter friend (Gene Wilder) are the only defense against a wave of thugs sent to rid the town of its population.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Western", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Mel Brooks", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,CrossbowProductions", "theater_date": "Feb 7, 1974", "dvd_date": "Oct 2, 2013", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Despite the narrative shortcomings, many of the gags are outstanding.", "A model of how not to make a comedy.

The powerhouse duo of Mel Brooks and Gene Wilder does not disappoint.", "A bad parody of Westerns. [Full Review in Spanish]", "It is a gigantic send-up of the western, as if that sad and nearly deserted genre needed any more grief... Brooks picks over the bones drying in the sun and constructs a hilarious skeleton for our amusement.", "Mel Brooks has come up with his most outrageous comedy to date in the brilliantly funny Blazing Saddles.", "by making harmless staples of Western films, such as Gabby Hayes, talk like real-life small-minded white men is unsettling and damning of the unspoken bigotry and entitlement in what is often perceived as harmless Americana.", "An extraordinarily gutsy film.", "More than simply a loving spoof of Hollywood westerns, Blazing Saddles is one of the funniest movies ever made... and one of the most audacious satires of racism to come out of Hollywood.", "Its genius, then and now, was the manner in which director Mel Brooks and his writers turned a broad Western spoof into what was, for its time, a revolutionary satire of race relations.", "A movie that neither blazes or misfires, falling somewhere between the horrors of Spaceballs and the genius of Young Frankenstein.", "This all-singing, all-belching western spoof remains one of Mel Brooks's finest creations.", "It's the best [director] Brooks has ever offered his audience.", "...may look like a Western, but in actuality it takes place in just another corner of Mel Brooks' mad brain.", "Kids may not get all of Brooks' Old West parody.", "Goldarned if the whole fool enterprise is not worth the attention of any moviegoer with a penchant for what one actor, commenting on another's Gabby Hayes imitation, calls 'authentic western gibberish.'", "A lewd spoof of westerns and racial prejudice; enough laughs to cover the fact that it is, essentially, a stupid movie.", "One of the funniest awful movies ever made.", "It's tough to beat as an outrageously phlegmy deposit in Hollywood's spittoon.", "Although Cleavon Little and Gene Wilder head a uniformly competent cast, pic is handily stolen by Harvey Korman and Madeline Kahn.
