Who's going to complain about that?", "Our intelligence... has been quite effectively assaulted by the motion picture Carmen Jones.", "As a play with music by Bizet one can forget that he and Mr. Hammerstein have taken a liberty with one of one's earliest memories, and after seeing it one must try to forget that, truth to tell, their Carmen Jones is really much better than Carmen.", "If you're not a fan of opera, you probably won't care much for 'Carmen Jones,' despite some pretty solid acting and scenes that bring postwar America to life.", "Dorothy Dandridge became the very first black woman to receive Best Actress Oscar nomination for Otto Preimger's audacious (for the early 1950s) all-black musical of the famous opera.", "A film in which talented, attractive people sing ugly lyrics to beautiful music in other people's beautiful voices amid ugly shot framing and ill-timed cutting.", "Electric performance by Dorothy Dandridge as the sultry whorish Carmen Jones.", "Preminger's heavy-handed adaptation of a Broadway triumph combines gorgeous music with risible lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein II; the project is saved by a terrific cast.", "Otto Preminger has transferred it to the screen with taste and imagination in an opulent production.", "Impeccably liberal in its time, the film has not aged gracefully, although Dorothy Dandridge's performance in the lead remains a testimony to a black cinema that might have been.", "The best reason to revisit Carmen Jones lies in Dorothy Dandridge's electrifying performance, which saw her become the first African-American to be nominated for a Best Actress Oscar.", "Every frame, you feel, is freighted with the tension imposed by the never-appearing white folks. It was, however, laudable in its desire to showcase the talents of African-American performers who were denied opportunities in Hollywood.", "Woefully miscast in places and extremely dubious in its portrayal of African-Americans but does boast an on-form Dorothy Dandridge.", "Slinking through director Preminger's CinemaScope widescreen in slit skirts and tight blouses, Dandridge is naturally carnal the way summer is naturally warm.", "The somewhat heavy-handed direction and the ultimately two-dimensional characters leave you admiring the workmanship without plucking at the necessary emotional/romantic heart-strings.", "The results are certainly flawed, but rarely less than fascinating.", "A truly dreadful film. Preminger can't be faulted for ambition, but for once, his execution is sorely lacking.", "A crazy mixed-up film.", "Worth seeing for Danridge's sultry, sweet performance.", "Interesting Preminger experiment. Modernizing with an all-black cast highlighted by Dandridge and Belafonte is first-rate."], "rating": ["", "", "", "7/10", "B+", "1.5/5", "B", "3/4", "", "", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "", "", "3.5/5", "2/5", "2/5", "3/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Edward Murrain", "John Morris", "Virginia Graham", "James Plath", "Emanuel Levy", "Michael W.
