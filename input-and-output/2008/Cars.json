It's that kind of a movie, and the real feel of the racing footage is absolutely spectacular.", "'Cars' has energy and heart-two things that 'Robots' lacked.", "Cars is a nice homily to small town life and remembering the past - which definitely has its charms - and call for remembering our roots, but it's been done better elsewhere.", "Unlike other Pixar releases, Cars does not cross over to adults as well as Finding Nemo or The Incredibles. But kids will love it, and isn't that what this type of animation is all about?", "Pixar's latest visual stunner with a heart of gold honors our obsession with the automobile. Although it will make many nostalgic for the open road, especially the historic Route 66, the kids might get a little bored with this one.", "Pixar's grown so metallic that having automobiles for animated characters becomes disturbingly apt", "Although the plot coasts along a predictable path, the verbal jokes and sight gags rev things up along the way, making the film enjoyable almost from start to finish.", "I've never seen a Pixar film so void of magic, and originality before...", "Owen Wilson's infectious good-natured energy permeates Pixar's light-hearted animated movie about \"Lightning McQueen\" a rookie competition race car that discovers there's more to life than winning races.", "This noisy animated paean to NASCAR and Route 66 gets mired in the middle laps on a grippy track.", "", "Cars is Pixar's most improbable success to date, a film that could easily have misfired, but somehow does not.", "Here it is, another masterpiece from director John Lasseter and his fellow geniuses at Pixar Animation Studios, once again raising the bar out of reach of everyone but themselves.", "Despite its technical accomplishments, Cars feels less Formula One than Ford Fiesta."], "rating": ["3/10", "", "B", "3/4", "3.5/4", "C+", "A-", "8/10", "6/10", "3.5/5", "3/5", "", "", "", "B-", "1.5/4", "3/5", "B+", "5/5", "2.5/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Alberto Abu\u00edn", "Micheal Compton", "Matt Brunson", "Matthew Lucas", "Rachel Wagner", "Joel Siegel", "James Plath", "Joshua Starnes", "Matthew Pejkovic", "Kit Bowen", "Fernando F.
