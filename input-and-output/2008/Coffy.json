{"metadata": {"synopsis": "As a nurse, Coffy (Pam Grier) has seen the ill effects of drugs up close, but it isn't until her little sister becomes addicted to heroin that she finally decides to wage a one-woman battle. Disguised as a prostitute, Coffy goes on a killing rampage, at first going after street dealers and pimps such as sleazy King George (Robert DoQui), then gradually working her way up to bigger honchos. She's shocked, however, when she discovers that her politician boyfriend (Booker Bradshaw) is involved.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics", "runtime": "1h 31m", "director": "Jack Hill", "studio": "AmericanInternationalPictures(AIP)", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Throw in a frenetic soundtrack, wonderful fashions, ample servings of sex, Sid Haig as a snarling henchman, and a fistful of moustaches and afros, then you have a classic of its time.", "Its real power comes from Hill's potent pulp storytelling and up-front style as well as the novelty of a female hero who takes charge and controls her own destiny.", "Peak Grier, Coffy is a sobering story kept at street level, and while Hill keeps the film in the realm of pulp fantasy, the stakes are high.", "Essential viewing for anyone with an interest in the genre, or who wants to see Pam Grier at her very best.", "Are these righteous breasts, or breasts of righteousness? Can they really be both at once?", "Grier is the movie's bristling force", "", "Jack Hill directs for maximal suspense, violence, and voyeuristic appeal (which Grier certainly embodies).", "If you're looking for nonstop, no-holds-barred exploitation, look no further. Pam Grier's first solo starring role is an enormously entertaining black action classic.", "Grier, a statuesque actress with a body she doesn't hesitate to show, is strongly cast. Booker Bradshaw as a city politician and William Elliott as an honest cop score well.", "", "The film totally revolves around Pam and she carries the film with a lethal and sexy punch.", "", "The world Coffy inhabits is revealed as one where social, sexual and political exploitation are simply the norms.", "", "Leaves a viewer with the happy thought that she now can get back to nursing and away from films like Coffy.", "Coffy is slightly more serious and a little more inventive than it needs to be.", "", "", "There's no denying the film's savage power"], "rating": ["8/10", "3.5/4", "3.5/5", "4/5", "2/4", "", "3/5", "", "3/4", "", "2/5", "B", "3/5", "", "4/5", "2/5", "2/4", "3/5", "4/5", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Andrew Pollard", "Jeffrey M.
