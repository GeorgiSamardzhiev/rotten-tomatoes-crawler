We feel you will have a bond of sympathy for Neal, both in person and story and that always makes for a good show.", "How fate can play tricks on a man is satisfactorily demonstrated in a melodrama with enough bite to command the attention closely throughout.", "[Detour] is a morbid melodrama, depressing and uninteresting.", "It Is a not-too-late-believable story of a piano player who ruined his life by hitch-hiking from New York to Los Angeles to marry his girl -- but it is told bluntly and briskly Local Vaudeville by Director Edgar Ulmer.", "Venturing far from the familiar melodramatic pattern, director Edgar G. Ulmer has turned out an adroit, albeit unpretentious production about a man who stumbles into a series of circumstances which seal his doom.", "One of the most poignant and disturbing stories to reach the screen in any year is this one. You're not just looking at a picture; you're right in it and suffering along with the man whose troubles are being told.", "A remarkably pacey and stylish B-movie thriller that's now rightly recognised as a minor classic.", "As effective as Neal's performance is, it's not the one for which Detour is best remembered. His foil is Ann Savage as Vera, living up to her surname as one of the most vicious, despicable femme fatales in noir history.", "...a compelling setup that's employed to watchable yet pervasively erratic effect by Ulmer...", "The inevitable fatalism of the oblivious heterosexual male remains at its most disconsolate zenith in Edgar G. Ulmer's timeless odyssey of anxiety.", "Table-turning, bluffing, hilarious verbal observations, and vitriolic insults compound with laugh-out-loud coincidences for a truly unique thriller.", "Well produced and directed, the picture sustains a tense mood throughout.", "Detour is about as threadbare as they come: a small film, shot on a shoestring over a handful of days at a Poverty Row film studio. And yet, the finished product is uniquely compelling.", "one of the darkest and most fatalistic of the postwar film noir-to the point that, if it didn't work so well, it could be mistaken for a postmodern parody of the genre", "Ulmer brings an enormous amount of impressionistic creativity and (what are now considered) infamous noir tropes into the project without spending more money.", "One of the most dour, dank and despairing of all film noir offerings.", "One of the greatest noirs of all time, shot on an almost non-existent budget, lives again.", "A one-of-a-kind masterpiece that is as bleak and bitter to behold as ever.", "The film, told in flashbacks, is held together by a poetically lurid interior monologue and directed, by Edgar G. Ulmer, with harrowingly expressive effects of light and shadow."], "rating": ["", "", "", "2/4", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "2.5/4", "4/5", "9/10", "", "", "3.5/4", "4/5", "3.5/4", "9/10", "5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mildred Martin", "Sara Hamilton", "Film Daily Staff", "Wanda Hale", "Herbert Cohn", "Mandel Herbstman", "LA Times Staff", "Tony Sloman", "Stephen Danay", "David Nusair", "Nicholas Bell", "Mike Massie", "P.S.
