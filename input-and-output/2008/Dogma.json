But it's clever in a deeply juvenile way.", "I couldn't care less whether Smith's metaphysical conceits about the war between Good and Evil are those of a devout believer or an atheist. The bottom line is that they're puerile.", "", "What you hear throughout Dogma, liberally peppered with the usual prankish profanities, is Kevin Smith having a conversation with himself about his faith.", "Writer-Director Kevin Smith keeps getting better.", "Dogma is more strained than funny.", "It's push-the-envelope coarse, thematically ambitious, and -- most dangerously -- self-consciously respectful and thoughtful on matters of faith and religion.", "Too talky, too fond of in-jokes, too caught up (especially during the dismally weak climax) in its crass comic-strip ethos, and not, finally, as funny, subversive or thought-provoking as it would like to be.", "At their best, his verbal exercises are pyrotechnical, at worst, logorrheic.", "It is thoughtful and funny but less than satisfying. Smith took on a bit too much, but I laud the effort.", "a surprisingly tender and humane movie that seems touchingly confident of God's sense of humor and infinite patience", "The film takes aim at so many contemporary targets and with such gusto that you fear each time you laugh you might be missing another wonderful line.", "Jumping on the pre-millennium, end-of-the-world hype, Smith has chosen an opportune time to take a satirical and witty look at the shortcomings of organized religion.", "Irreverent, but it is hardly sacrilegious.", "I loved seeing all these great character actors at work, and the discussions are rich and intelligent."], "rating": ["4/5", "3.5/5", "", "3.5/5", "", "3/4", "", "3.5/4", "4/5", "3/4", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "B-", "B", "5/5", "4/5", "3/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["PJ Nabarro", "Jason Zingale", "Steve Biodrowski", "", "Todd McCarthy", "Maitland McDonagh", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Wesley Lovell", "Rob Gonsalves", "Joe Lozito", "Andrew Sarris", "Mark Bourne", "Geoff Andrew", "James Verniere", "Robin Clifford", "Philip Martin", "Liz Braun", "Drew McAnulty", "Louis B.
