{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this film loosely based on a true story, Domino Harvey (Keira Knightley), a former model, is now a bounty hunter who has been arrested for robbing an armored car. During interrogation, she claims innocence and tells her story. Harvey became a pupil of Ed Moseby (Mickey Rourke), who ran a course for aspiring bounty hunters. Along with Choco (Edgar Ram\u00edrez), the three of them became a successful team. But, when a bail bondsman (Delroy Lindo) offered a job, they faced a complicated frame-up.", "rating": "18", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 8m", "director": "Tony Scott", "studio": "Domino17521Inc.", "theater_date": "Oct 14, 2005", "dvd_date": "Aug 19, 2011", "box_office": "$10.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A bad movie..., almost repulsive. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Richard \"Donnie Darko\" Kelly's screenplay is a fantastical, incoherent fuzz while director Tony Scott tries and fails to recapture the energy and fun of his 1993 hit, True Romance.", "While visual anarchy can be starling and bracing in chunks, Domino quickly settles into a one-tone-fits-all groove that's desperately wearying.", "Despite a great deal of promise and a rousing (albeit too drawn out) finale, it is crippled by a lack of narrative focus and good characterization. But it could have been so much more, and that is truly the worst thing that could be said about it.", "Kelly writes an often taut and fascinating look at bounty hunters gives us some truly likable characters I often found myself rooting for.", "...a tribute to Domino Harvey that reduces her to a nerve-jangling, romanticized song lyric.", "Domino is one insane gibbering beast, leagues more idiosyncratic than the average action flick.", "a twisted head spinner of a biopic, where myth is always racing hot on the heels of a fugitive reality.", "A well-paced action movie, if a little long, with an unusual feeling of surrealism behind the action.", "", "full review in Greek", "No doubt an interesting story could be told about her life, but this standard-issue assault on the senses isn't it.", "Sometimes sound and fury can be quite something in its own right--and for a true character (in every sense) like Domino, it's enough.", "", "", "All-sizzle, no-substance.", "Os personagens s\u00e3o interessantes, o filme tem energia, mas o roteiro se perde a partir da metade da trama e os habituais excessos estil\u00edticos de Scott mant\u00e9m o espectador \u00e0 dist\u00e2ncia.", "This is a ridiculous movie. But is it fun-ridiculous, like Scarface? Might it go on to become a cult item? I suspect not.", "Domino looks like what an Avid might vomit up after partially digesting the digitized footage. It's flashy as hell, but the amphetamine-fueled method is compensating for a distinct lack of substance.", "When a film is more conducive to a scholarly dissection than a consumerist examination, the film is incredibly clever, pragmatic, or pretentious. In the case of Domino, it's all of the above."], "rating": ["", "1/5", "3/10", "5/10", "", "6/10", "4/5", "", "3.2", "1/4", "2/5", "2/4", "3/4", "1/5", "3/5", "C-", "3/5", "1/4", "D+", "2.5/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Alberto Abu\u00edn", "Kaleem Aftab", "Tim Brayton", "Joshua Starnes", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "John J.
