His Method acting techniques and uninhibited performing style cause him to stand out among the more conventional cast.", "East of Eden deals with inner conflict; the entire story could be played out in a living room. Instead it sprawls all over the eye-filling landscape and the real action is padded ...", "It's far from a dull movie, but it's certainly a very strange one; it's an enshrinement of the mixed-up kid.", "Rich historical detail and good visuals make interesting film.", "Catches fire in the clashes between Dean (as the bad brother) and Raymond Massey as his stiff-necked dad.", "After testing various performers (including a newcomer named Paul Newman), Kazan went with the unknown Dean, a move that immediately yielded dividends.", "a reaction to our plutocracy's values and a further case for Dean as the sainted figure of rebellion that would fuel the generational schism of the '60s.", "East of Eden is set in 1917 but [James] Dean feels completely modern and contemporary, a boy not quite comfortable in his body.", "Fine James Dean vehicle, one of few that put him into immortality.", "Kazan had the bad sense to leave out the best parts from the lengthy book.", "John Steinbeck's painful biblical allegory -- Genesis replayed in Monterey, California, circa 1917 -- is more palatable on the screen, thanks to the down-to-earth performances of James Dean as Cal/Cain and Richard Davalos as Aron/Abel.", "", "James Dean's finest performance", "It's a film of great performances, atmospheric photography, and a sure sense of period and place.", "Not only one of Kazan's richest films and Dean's first significant role, it is also arguably the actor's best performance.", "What could be a better way to spend two hours?"], "rating": ["", "8/10", "", "3/5", "3.4/5", "", "", "", "3/5", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "", "5/5", "C+", "", "5/5", "5/5", "", "5/5", "4.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Andrew Sarris", "Mike Massie", "Basil Taylor", "Barbara Shulgasser", "Monica Reid", "Robert Hatch", "Pauline Kael", "Michael E.
