It's a propaganda movie that shows no empathy for its characters or for its audience.", "Padilha succumbs to monotonous, hollow flamboyance with his City of God clone.", "The moral dilemmas are gripping, but the film takes itself far too seriously to ever connect with us.", "A film that simply doesn't have enough cinematic flair to make it a better than average cops and robbers thriller.", "Padilha gets as close to the daily violence as City of God, though this feels more like a documentary than an epic.", "Padilha's style, honed in his hijack documentary Bus 174, is verismo with a vengeance.
