{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Released in 1940, represented Disney's boldest experiment to date. Bringing to life his vision of blending animated imagery with classical music.

But its entertainment value is Immense and unquestionable.", "Fantasia is a strange hybrid that only represents the creator's delusions of grandeur. [Full Review in Spanish]", "I admire Walt Disney so much for making such bold films.", "the films in the Disney Vault are brilliant pieces of work that need to be seen in the best visual presentation possible", "The words most used to describe \"Fantasia,\" besides the conventional \"beautiful\" and \"wonderful\" were \"path-breaking\" and \"courageous.\" The phrase \"courageous beyond belief\" would be even more accurate.", "I belong to those who had no need of that kind of entertainment, being content with seeing pictures and hearing music.", "[Disney's] most personal and grandest vision. Watching the movie again proves that, of course, it's not a chore. It's a pleasure.", "Breathtaking animation feat -- with some creepy visuals.", "Despite a couple of uneven parts that may try the patience of some, the whole of Fantasia is a marvel.", "Though Fantasia didn't perform as well as Walt Disney had hoped, it remains a testament to his exceptional cinematic genius. [Blu-ray]", "A symphony of sound, animation and unbridled Disney spirit.", "At the time of its release, it was probably the boldest, most experimental production to come out of Hollywood, which is why it is not terribly surprising that it was Disney's biggest commercial failure.", "Give me the ostriches in ballet shoes and the hippos in tutus ... over the cute fauns and unicorns frolicking in a pastel landscape ... any day.", "Ribboned with flaws both impossibly minor and embarrassingly large, but it surely must count as one of the most visually stunning American movies ever made.", "Critics may deplore Disney's lapses of taste, but he trips, Mickey-like, into an art form that immortals from Aeschylus to Richard Wagner have always dreamed of.", "The most ambitious animated feature ever to come out of the Disney studios...", "There is something in Fantasia for every taste."], "rating": ["", "1", "", "", "", "A+", "4/5", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "3.5/4", "8/10", "3.5/4", "", "1", "", "4/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Martin Quigley Jr.", "Mike Massie", "Guardian Staff", "SMH Staff", "Antonio Lara", "Rachel Wagner", "Kevin Carr", "Edwin Schallert", "Franz Hoellering", "Jeffrey M.
