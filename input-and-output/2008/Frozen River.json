She isn't merely tough as old boots - she makes old boots look like ballet shoes.", "Courtney Hunt's work is a dramatic thriller, but it is also a rich character study of a woman we have all met.", "... I thought the performances were good, but I just thought it could have done more.", "This fine drama delivers a reality tougher than realism.", "Frozen River is bleak and uncompromising - and that's just how the Academy likes it.", "", "A pair of border-town losers come to represent everyone who's ever been up against it in this country, especially the women.", "Melissa Leo's Oscar-nominated performance as a mother not above illegal business, but resolutely clinging to honesty and not giving into hypocrisy, is terrific.
