{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A scruffy superhero named Hancock (Will Smith) protects the citizens of Los Angeles but leaves horrendous collateral damage in the wake of every well-intentioned feat. That's OK with Hancock; he doesn't care what people think and is just as likely to be found dozing on a park bench as saving a damsel in distress. However, after saving the life of a PR executive (Jason Bateman) and meeting the man's beautiful wife (Charlize Theron), he realizes that he may have a sensitive side after all.", "rating": "41", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Peter Berg", "studio": "BlueLight,OverbrookEntertainment,WeedRoadPictures", "theater_date": "Jul 2, 2008", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$227.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's the lack of real, substantial solutions for an outlandish fantasy tale that prevents this film from being as extraordinary as Hancock himself.", "Silly? Sure.

Tone shifts from \"Ha-ha-ha, that Jason Bateman sure is amusing,\" to \"Oh, my God, can anyone stop the bleeding?!?\"", "Bateman, whose name is usually mud when it comes to appearing in good movies, brings out the best in Smith the actor and the action becomes surprisingly fresh and funny.", "[At first] Hancock is great fun, quirky and hilarious... Smith especially proves every minute why he's become the best in Hollywood. Then the movie takes an odd turn and goes into a whole other story, with different -- and deeper, I guess -- meanings.", "... the tape is an excellent way to have fun, without question. [Full review in Spanish]", "Hancock is funny and pretty fresh but finally gives up on idiosyncrasy, leaving you nothing much to discover.", "And if you're still not willing to forgive Hancock, and least there is the scene where he shoves a guy's head up another guy's butt.", "Hancock is what happens when you have talented people working on quality material: it's really a no-brainer that it works so well.", "", "", "Kicks into tired oh-it-sucks-to-have-superpowers territory and opens up a can of racial issues it has no intention of investigating", "I have no problem signing on to recommend this. Get it? Signing on...John Hancock... nevermind.", "A few actors such as Clint Eastwood, marry substance and popularity. But very few. Most actors' egos lead them to slum in the box office. I'm reminded of this often when a major, talented actor opts for popularity instead of substance when the latter beck", "...an engaging and thoroughly innovative spin on the superhero genre...", "What an odd movie!", "The trouble with Hancock is that its wry, reflexive commentary on the pressure of being Will Smith gets lost in the more typical reflexivity of the big-budget Hollywood fiasco."], "rating": ["6/10", "1.5/4", "3/5", "C", "2/4", "", "3/5", "", "3/5", "", "3/5", "4/5", "2/5", "2/5", "", "5/5", "1.5/5", "3/4", "5/10", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Leigh Paatsch", "Micheal Compton", "Namrata Joshi", "Eileen Jones", "Kaleem Aftab", "Marcianne Miller", "Laura Hiros", "Stuart Klawans", "Simon Miraudo", "Ali Gray", "Dave Calhoun", "Ben Kenigsberg", "Fernando F.
