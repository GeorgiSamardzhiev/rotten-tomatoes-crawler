{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Three successive family Thanksgiving dinners mark time for Hannah (Mia Farrow), her younger sisters Lee (Barbara Hershey) and Holly (Dianne Wiest) and the men in their lives. Lee is having an affair with Hannah's husband, Elliot (Michael Caine), and trying to end her Svengali-like romance with artist Frederick (Max von Sydow). Holly is frustrated by her lack of career fulfillment and her increasing dependence on Hannah's largesse, while being courted by the hypochondriac Mickey (Woody Allen).", "rating": "91", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Woody Allen", "studio": "OrionPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 20, 2015", "box_office": "$37.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The finest film I've seen from the year I was born remains quite a thing indeed.", "Is Hannah and Her Sisters, the 14th movie written and directed by Allen, worth the wait? No.", "Allen is one of the rare clowns with the gift of discovering the universal upon his own doorstep.", "Brilliant but mature comic-drama about an imperfect family.", "The marvel of Hannah and Her Sisters is just how many fully realized characters and relationships Allen is able to weave into the fabric of this extraordinarily well-written film. This script is one to be studied by aspiring filmmakers.", "Perfection is boring, but boring is the very last word to describe Hannah and Her Sisters, which just may be a perfect movie.", "Hannah and Her Sisters is structured ingeniously so that seemingly separate stories eventually merge in satisfying ways.", "This gifted ensemble works hard to make Hannah and Her Sisters the best movie of the year so far, perhaps the best that Allen has ever made.", "Allen`s ear for the strained marital conversation, the fury of a breakup and the tentativeness of starting a romance is impeccable.", "Hannah and Her Sisters is also filmmaking of consummate skill and emotional range. It encompasses brilliant comedy and almost unbearable poignance -- often in the same scene.", "The film weaves a rich Chekhovian mix, full of wry insights into the fragility of human emotions.", "The usual fever of adjectives -- terrific, titanic, transcendent -- sounds puny.", "[A] warm, multi-stranded, near-nepotistic family saga that contains the usual awkward dates, clandestine meetings and failed marriages.", "Allen weaves together the complex narrative strands with ease, punctuating the many variations on betrayal and love with three festive Thanksgiving dinners.", "...makes me wish Allen would get men out of the picture more often.", "at the very least a conversation starter", "Caine's performance, so fervent, so agonisingly dedicated, actually gains in force and touching sincerity with the years.", "The tangled web of relationships is very effectively done, but just as affecting is Allen's portrayal of the city he loves.", "Its plot has the elegant geometry of a Philip Barry play.", "The comedy-drama succeeds as a sharply pointed portrait of sibling rivalry."], "rating": ["", "", "", "5/5", "4/4", "", "", "", "", "4/4", "5/5", "", "5/5", "", "3/4", "2.5/5", "4/5", "7", "", "A-"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Scott Nye", "Dolores Barclay", "David Robinson", "Renee Schonfeld", "Gene Siskel", "Sheila Benson", "Jay Boyar", "Joe Baltake", "Candice Russell", "Desmond Ryan", "Philip Kemp", "Peter Travers", "Andrew Collins", "David Denby", "Josh Larsen", "Kevin Carr", "Peter Bradshaw", "Gabe Leibowitz", "Richard Corliss", "Dennis Schwartz"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Battleship Pretension", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">7M Pictures", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film and Felt", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews"], "date": ["December 8, 2020", "October 22, 2018", "December 31, 2017", "January 28, 2015", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "February 10, 2014", "July 30, 2013", "June 9, 2013", "December 22, 2011", "October 14, 2009", "November 21, 2008", "September 14, 2008"]}}
