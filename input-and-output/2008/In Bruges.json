{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After a particularly difficult job, hit men Ray (Colin Farrell) and Ken (Brendan Gleeson) head to Belgium to hide out until things cool down. Ray hates the medieval city they land in, but Ken finds its beauty and peacefulness enchanting. Their experiences become increasingly surreal and possibly life-changing as they encounter tourists, locals, an American dwarf and a potential romance for Ray.", "rating": "84", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Martin McDonagh", "studio": "BlueprintPictures", "theater_date": "Feb 8, 2008", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$7.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Why make such a film at this point in time? There's a good deal going on in the world, why this?

It's just all the violence that did me in.", "One of the strengths of this film, which is one of the year's best, is the way it gets more dire and nuanced with every character it introduces.", "... a fun and original feature film. [Full review in Spanish]", "The kind of movie that dabbles in playful allusions before it fizzles into a flat finale.", "Its European setting places additional gravity on McDonagh's Irish-Catholic notions of reckoning-the knowledge that we have to pay for our sins, no matter how great or small.", "This is one of those movies that kicks off with a slow engine and picks up at full speed in the second half.", "... a knockdown and cockeyed comedy of violence.", "I never expected to be moved by In Bruges, but I was.", "Those who know McDonagh's work know a vein of darkness will run deeply through the comedy. It has seldom been darker.
