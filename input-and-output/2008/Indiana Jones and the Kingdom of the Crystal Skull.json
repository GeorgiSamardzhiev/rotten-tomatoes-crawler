{"metadata": {"synopsis": "It's the height of the Cold War, and famous archaeologist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), returning from his latest adventure, finds out his job at Marshall College is in jeopardy. He meets Mutt (Shia La Beouf), a young man who wants Indy to help him find the legendary Crystal Skull of Akator, and the pair set out for Peru. However, deadly agent Irina Spalko (Cate Blanchett) is searching for the powerful artifact, too, because the Soviets believe it can help them conquer the world.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Action & Adventure", "runtime": "2h 2m", "director": "Steven Spielberg", "studio": "LucasfilmLtd.", "theater_date": "May 22, 2008", "dvd_date": "Jan 28, 2014", "box_office": "$317.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A film long, to my mind unfairly, lambasted by critics and indeed fans, perhaps because in part it moved away from the template laid down in previous instalments.", "They've taken a character of extreme popularity and a trilogy of great admiration and added an additional chapter of unnecessary absurdity.", "The kind of action that was funny and exciting in Raiders of the Lost Ark now looks incredibly dated.", "I contend that it is a worthy addition to the Indy mythology and is actually better than another movie in the original trilogy. But yes, for Indiana Jones Crystal Skull is an interesting case study.", "I simply must give kudos to what is easily the year's most stellar cinematography from Oscar winner Janusz Kaminski.", "While Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skullis intended to pass the torch to a new generation, it remains to be seen what will happen.", "The first three Indy movies involved 1) the Lost Ark of the Covenant, 2) Evil demon magic, and 3) the actual frickin' Holy Grail. To those who loudly pshawed at lead fridges and aliens, I pshaw right back.", "With an unfettered, throw caution to the wind, giddy joy and death-defying exhilaration and even alien mysticism, Spielberg and partner George Lucas, bring the magic of the 30's and 40's popcorn serial larger than life E-ticket ride, back to the movies.", "An entertaining throwback that feels as comfortable as an old varsity letter jacket. Sure, the material is familiar, but this is a case where that familiarity is part of the charm.", "Despite its shortcomings, Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is an absolute blast.", "It's adequate, but not exceptional, and while that might be enough for any other movie, this is an Indiana Jones movie, and that can't help but be a little disappointing.", "Crystal Skull carries its legacy with a sort of \"I still got it\" bravado that makes you smile at its AARP filmmakers rather than pity them.", "While there's no denying that Crystal Skull succeeds as a summer popcorn flick, it won't follow in Raiders' footsteps by becoming a classic audiences will want to watch again and again for years to come.", "Except for one grossly offensive aspect -- done twice --Crystal Skull is everything Indy fans want. It's a big, noisy, entertaining escape from reality. It makes no sense whatsoever and who cares?", "Everything happens so dizzyingly fast and with such a dazzling disregard for any kind of realism it sort of doesn't matter that the plot is a silly rambling nonsense or that Harrison Ford is now 312.", "Good special effects, an entertaining story and nostalgia... [Full review in Spanish]", "Accusing Steven Spielberg of overkill at this point in his career, however, seems redundant. Indy IV is an entertaining big screen ride for the whole family, excluding small children and fussy cinephiles.", "Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is quite a bit of fun.", "If only they had refrained from indulging themselves quite so much, perhaps they could have delivered a film that was more in keeping with the standards that previous Indy outings had set.", "The film's joyless, going-through-the-motions mood cannot be ignored."], "rating": ["3/5", "5/10", "", "8/10", "3.0/4", "4.5/5", "4.5/5", "", "B", "3/4", "B-", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "2/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Tony Black", "Mike Massie", "Jason Best", "Alex Maidy", "Richard Propes", "Danielle Solzman", "Christopher Lloyd", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Micheal Compton", "Matthew Lucas", "Zaki Hasan", "Stephen Garrett", "Megan Basham", "Marcianne Miller", "Deborah Ross", "Laura Hiros", "Brian D.
