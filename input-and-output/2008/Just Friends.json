He finally confesses his feelings, but she tells him that she just wants to be friends, and he leaves town in shame.

[Full Review in Spanish]", "Worth watching just for Christopher Marquette's hilarious turn as Chris's pain-in-the-neck brother, this obnoxious comedy has a generous helping of natural, surprising laughs amid the bumptious stupidity.", "No matter what filmmakers intend, fat suits always take over the movies they're in.", "Not particularly original, Just Friends works largely due to Reynolds' screen charisma and comic timing, but it does work, and works well.", "Embraces its silliness and still comes out a mostly hilarious experience...", "Despite a rich premise, Just Friends ultimately fails to live up to its early potential, settling into broad comedy that shortchanges the romantic possibilities.", "No one will be surprised by the plot machinations that ensue, but the film is saved from utter tedium thanks to a relatively intelligent screenplay and the amiability of the leads.", "Um bom conceito (e no estou dizendo que este  bom) s funciona quando amparado por um bom roteiro.
