{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the midst of World War II, an array of colorful American soldiers gets inside information from a drunk German officer about millions of dollars worth of gold hidden on enemy soil. Kelly (Clint Eastwood), a private with the platoon, devises a plan to sneak past the German officers to steal the loot for his crew. They recruit more men and set their plan into action. Despite several casualties, the men are determined to press forward, even if it means striking a deal with the opposing army.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 25m", "director": "Brian G.

Time has made it more intuitive and caustic a film, than its daft reputation might suggest.", "A terrific guys-on-a-mission movie.", "This humorous, lively, and entertaining picture could be described as a caper film set against a WW II backdrop.", "...the filmmakers clearly intended the movie to be a carefree caper, and if one views it that way, it can pass an entertaining few hours.", "A strange but mostly satisfying hybrid of WWII actioner and anti-war satire...
