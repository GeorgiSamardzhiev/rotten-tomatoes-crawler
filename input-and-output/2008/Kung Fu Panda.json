[Full Review in Spanish]", "It's not a bad movie. I just didn't love it like I was hoping too.", "Good performances, excellent special effects, impeccable animation... [Full review in Spanish]", "Well, for a kiddie animation spectacle I'd give it more than a passing grade.", "Kung Fu Panda is pretty much like it sounds.", "Kung Fu Panda is not as much fun as Kung Fu Hustle, but it's much better than Kung Pow: Enter the Fist.", "There's something about the look of Kung Fu Panda that is so novel and pleasing. Perhaps it's just that we haven't seen this vintage, Far East world in a computer-animated movie before.", "Some of it just seems silly, which is fine for a family movie, of course, but there's silly and then there's silly. Kung Fu Panda is silly.", "When the kids are happy and I get to watch a Jack Black kung fu movie, that's good enough for me.", "The animation work is dazzling; it's lovingly detailed without being overdone (particularly the opening sequence, which is hand-drawn and looks like prints struck from ancient woodblocks).", "Supporting characters (including Jolie, who is wasted as a tiger) are pallid, and the fight scenes disproportionately long, as if the filmmakers figure the young boys most likely to see Panda are just as action-happy as their dads.", "A decent bridge before the wonder of WALL-E, Kung Fu Panda will thrill kids and fight nuts alike. Shame the big names are underused and there's nothing particularly new.", "Kung Fu Panda is hugely entertaining, gorgeously animated and expertly cast, with Jack Black and Dustin Hoffman doing some of their best work in recent memory (no joke).", "This beautifully designed, cherry blossom-hued cartoon is brighter, breezier and bouncier than most.", "An energetic and surprisingly colorful family adventure tale that trumps formula through sheer force of personality."], "rating": ["7/10", "2.5/4", "", "", "B", "", "C+", "3/5", "", "", "", "3/4", "2.5/5", "", "", "", "3/5", "B+", "3/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Ruhaan Shah", "Ed Travis", "Micheal Compton", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Rachel Wagner", "Laura Hiros", "Brian D.
