And that's what disappoints me most about 'Paradise.'", "Savagely satirizing evangelical culture while pretty much not substituting anything else - unless you count Vegas as the proposed cure in question - in Juno screenwriter Diablo Cody's directing debut. In other words, sorry Paradise, you're no Juno.", "Wild Vegas night of drinking, self-discovery is so-so.", "Cody's fresh coming-of-age story keeps pulling back from blossoming into something a bit magical.", "The movie goes nowhere, and Ms. Cody's screenplay is relentlessly talky while standing still.", "Hough sleepwalks through Cody's worst effort to date as a writer and only supporting turns by the always-game Russell Brand and never-bad Octavia Spencer save the film from being a strong candidate for the worst of the year. It still comes close.", "An intriguing premise, but the execution is a bit faulty, and it doesn't ultimately add up to much.", "Julianne Hough and Octavia Spencer give it their all, but uncharacteristically dismal writing from Diablo Cody leaves Paradise dead in the water.", "Paradise may be a movie paved with good intentions, but between its meandering nature, surface exploration of religion and roster of forgettable characters, it's more like motion-picture perdition.", "Diablo Cody has a new movie... but you'd hardly know it was her work, for all the bite it lacks.", "Diablo Cody should've written a better script for her directing debut, or at least used her Oscar-winning instincts to not choose this one... isn't in the same snarky-lark league as Juno, nor as comically raw as Young Adult.", "A Vegas-set dramedy that begins as a spikey comedy only to evolve into precisely the kind of banal, self-improvement seminar that one of Cody's edgy heroines would snark endlessly through."], "rating": ["", "", "", "C-", "C", "2.5/4", "2/5", "3/4", "", "", "2/5", "6.2/10", "2/4", "1.0/5", "2/5", "2/10", "1.5/4", "", "C-", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "Stephen Saito", "Lee Jutton", "Jared Mobarak", "Jack Giroux", "David Nusair", "Jeff Beck", "Dustin Putman", "Betty Jo Tucker", "Prairie Miller", "S.
