{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this unconventional French drama, a group of unnamed aristocrats interact at a palatial ch\u00e2teau, resulting in an enigmatic tale told partially in flashback. X (Giorgio Albertazzi) is convinced that he has met the beautiful A (Delphine Seyrig) before in the Czech resort town of Marienbad, and implies they had a romantic relationship. M (Sacha Pitoeff), who may be A's husband or boyfriend, confronts her mysterious suitor, leading to conflict and questions about the truth behind his story.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Science Fiction & Fantasy/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Alain Resnais", "studio": "ArgosFilms,TerraFilmProduktion,Cocinor", "theater_date": "Jun 25, 1961", "dvd_date": "Nov 8, 2016", "box_office": "$60.1K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Every shot is filled with beauty and with mystery.", "A treatise on memory and longing, of ideas lost to the fog of time, shards of dreams scattered across a marble floor.", "It is a charade, a masque, beautiful to the eyes -- I can't remember a film of more sustained visual delight -- and interesting to the mind, or at least to the crossword-puzzle-solving part of the mind, but curiously lacking in emotional affect.", "Undulant in the brain... imagery shimmying and shimmering and splintered, Resnais' snoot-cock at chi-chi is both mordant and adoring. Yet there is more to do than to look or listen passively: it must be invented in the watching.", "The story's obscurity turns out to result from its protagonists' own efforts to deny or blur their painful past.", "A pioneering, essential work of arthouse cinema that remains as enrapturing and illusive as ever.", "Last Year in Marienbad remains a dazzling, spellbinding and iconic work of 1960s cinema.", "If you're a hipster who loves highly stylised French cinema of the 1960s New Wave this might be a treat. For the rest of us, it's unwatchable.", "It's more rewarding to treat the film as a poem, drinking in the icily majestic images, and realising that wherever Resnais' endless tracking shots are leading, it's not towards meaning.", "The visual moments that remain in the mind are without exception locked into place by the intensity of the score.", "[VIDEO ESSAY] Alain Resnais's transcendent filmic parlor game remains an innovative and exquisitely executed example of minimalist filmmaking, used to evoke mystery, romance, and a sprinkle social invective.", "The poster child of cinematic modernism, one of those early-'60s event films that seemed to break every rule classical Hollywood ever codified.", "", "I've always found it romantic and sexy, full of yearning and mystery.", "Was there ever a film thought so boring by so many yet accorded the status of a classic?", "Profoundly mysterious and disturbing, a para-surrealist masterpiece whose nightmarish scenario appears to have been absorbed from Bu\u00f1uel and Antonioni and transmitted onward to Greenaway.", "an enigmatic mind-melt that sends characters and viewers alike on a chronology-confounding loop down labyrinthine corridors and up garden paths in pursuit of a (re)solution that, even after it has been found, remains elusive and ambiguous.", "A veritable masterpiece, but beware, this icon of French New Wave cinema is as likely to irritate as it is to mesmerise.", "A sublime meditation on memory, perception and fantasy - or art-house pretension at its emptiest?
