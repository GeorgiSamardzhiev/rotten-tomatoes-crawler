{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When a space mission involving American and British astronauts encounters an alien craft, the humanoids within are brought aboard the shuttle. Back on Earth, one of the extraterrestrials, who appears to be a gorgeous woman (Mathilda May), proceeds to suck the life force out of various Londoners, turning the town into a city of roaming half-dead people.

But I would call this an audacious SF/horror film", "\"The American cut - with its Michael Kamen music - is the superior version of the film...\"", "Seen today, it's actually an astoundingly brave, weird movie that tries more and accomplishes more than many of today's bland roller coaster rides.", "Occasionally silly, but still unique and very entertaining...", "How often do you find a sci-fi/horror hybrid that dares to walk the high wire? Not often enough, I think.
