{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The romantic ups and downs of accountant Mollie Jensen (Kirstie Alley) are viewed cynically by a most unusual bystander -- her talking newborn, Mikey (Bruce Willis). She becomes pregnant through an affair with a married man, Albert (George Segal), and then counts on the friendship of taxi driver James (John Travolta) once she discovers Albert is a lying cad. Although Mikey likes James, and James cares for both the baby and Mollie, she isn't sure she can settle down with a blue-collar boyfriend.", "rating": "56", "genre": "Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Amy Heckerling", "studio": "TriStarPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 12, 2014", "box_office": "$137.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["[Amy Heckerling] bulls her way through this smash-hit comedy by playing up to the most base assumptions of the average audience.", "It would certainly be a nice change to see a modem single mom as a film hero, but Mikey, even before birth, is the hero of Look Who's Talking.", "Forgettable and innocuous...", "Enjoyable first film in the \"talking baby\" genre.", "With his sarcastic delivery, Willis has the ideal voice for the part.
