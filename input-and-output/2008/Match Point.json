{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Tennis instructor Chris Wilton (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) grows friendly with Tom Hewett (Matthew Goode), a wealthy student who shares an interest in opera. Invited to attend a performance with Tom, Chris meets the family and instantly attracts Tom's sister, Chloe (Emily Mortimer). Chris marries her to get a job with her millionaire father, Alec (Brian Cox), but a dangerous affair with Nola Rice (Scarlett Johansson), Tom's American girlfriend, threatens his newfound social status.", "rating": "77", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 4m", "director": "Woody Allen", "studio": "PeridoProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 6, 2014", "box_office": "$23.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A glorious ride, with touches of Hitchcock, Patricia Highsmith and Woody Allen sprinkled through a film whose panoramic views of contemporary London are the next-best thing to a budget-weekend escape flight.", "A mesmerising mix of moral drama and dark humour, with a shock ending to die for.", "A finely tuned comeback worth celebrating.", "The change of locale from New York to London has done Woody Allen a world of good. As has oft been said, Match Point is his best movie since ... fill in the blank.", "His first film set in London, it boasts a young, pretty, something-for-everyone cast. As enter-tainment, however, it just slams limply into the net every time.", "Woody Allen's freshest and most potent film in years manages to be much more than an erotic thriller.", "...one of the venerable writer/director's more accomplished efforts in this new century.", "But, perhaps, the greatest parallel between Woody's Match Point and Hitch is duality. It's a brilliant device.", "", "This lean, mean, surprisingly sultry thriller about fate, luck, greed and guilt is Woody Allen's best since \"Mighty Aphrodite.\" Plus, it boasts a vintage-Allen metaphor of a bobbling tennis ball that, in a great gotcha scene, becomes a damning motif.", "There's no ground here that Allen hasn't gone over before, but as a treatment of upper crust mores and, eventually, as a thriller, it's compulsively watchable and generally well acted.", "Allen merely regurgitates his shrunken vision in veddy-British padding", "A limp, dull, and contrived rehash of \"Crimes and MisDemeanors\"...", "Just when you were about to give up on Woody Allen, he reinvents himself with a taut tour de force of a film that is unquestionably the best thing he's done in decades.", "... retools the resolution of Crimes and Misdemeanors so its hero, instead of losing his grasp on morality, never even had a hold on morality in the first place.", "", "Proves to be an intriguing enough adventure, provided you haven't seen Crimes and Misdemeanors and don't mind rooting for a despicable, amoral philanderer.", "", "Match Point proves that Allen, at 70 years old, is very much still in the game.", "Extremely disappointing."], "rating": ["", "4/5", "3/4", "", "", "", "3/4", "4.0/5", "C", "4/4", "3/4", "", "", "8/10", "B+", "3/4", "3/4", "A-", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Lamble", "Leigh Paatsch", "Matthew Lucas", "David Ansen", "Victoria Segal", "Betsy Sherman", "David Nusair", "Tony Macklin", "Nell Minow", "Nick Rogers", "Jay Antani", "Fernando F.
