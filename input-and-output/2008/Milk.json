{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1972, Harvey Milk (Sean Penn) and his then-lover Scott Smith leave New York for San Francisco, with Milk determined to accomplish something meaningful in his life. Settling in the Castro District, he opens a camera shop and helps transform the area into a mecca for gays and lesbians. In 1977 he becomes the nation's first openly gay man elected to a notable public office when he wins a seat on the Board of Supervisors. The following year, Dan White (Josh Brolin) kills Milk in cold blood.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Drama/Gay & Lesbian", "runtime": "2h 8m", "director": "Gus Van Sant", "studio": "GroundswellProductions,Jinks/CohenCompany", "theater_date": "Nov 26, 2008", "dvd_date": "Jun 15, 2012", "box_office": "$31.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A commanding and persuasive biopic that is easily the best thing to come from the hit-or-miss director in a very long time.", "The best film of 2008.", "The artistic consequence of all this is a distinct unevenness...", "With Milk, Harvey's legacy and voice live on and he still does give us hope. A film for our time. A film that is timely. A film not to be missed.", "Milk is very much an accessible journey driven by a remarkably charismatic performance from Sean Penn.", "Sean Penn is remarkable as Milk, giving what could very well be the finest performance in his distinguished career.", "The film has a talented cast, some sharp direction and a story that is as relevant today as it was when it unfolded in the late '70s.", "Penn is so well-tuned that not for a minute does his Milk lapse into a caricature.", "Gus Van Sant's portrait of San Francisco politician Harvey Milk clunks along as the squarest movie he's ever made, a result of the director investing more emotion in the martyred idol than in the bleeding man.", "Like many a nostalgia trip, it stops at the moment the style it's rejecting is about to begin.", "Sean Penn's portrayal of Milk stands out, with his considerable weight loss and authentic body language... [Full review in Spanish]", "Milk is fortuitously, if inevitably, a movie of its moment.", "Penn may be the main attraction, but this is very much an ensemble piece. Emile Hirsch, as cheeky street kid turned activist Cleve Jones, Diego Luna as Milk's annoyingly needy, unstable second lover and James Franco's Scott, add to the communal spirit.", "[Dustin Lance] Black's attempts to dress up this schema in the gay trappings afforded by his subject do nothing to meaningfully pervert the form-or Milk's emotional tidiness.", "Penn's performance is inspiring, a transformation that finds the heart and soul of a historical figure and sends blood pumping through a man who has become practically deified over the decades.", "While making a political, historical biopic, Van Sant managed, concurrently, to make a visually beautiful, emotionally thrilling and surprisingly personal work of art.", "Penn burrows inside his character, capturing not only Milk's Long Island Jewish intonations and his gay body language but also the intensity of his beliefs and the particular mix of fear and desire through which he viewed the world.", "Harvey repeats throughout the film, \"you've gotta give 'em hope.\" He did the legwork. The film is just a reminder.", "The movie's getting a lot of praise for being an \"unconventional\" biopic. I don't think this is true, but it's happening, I suspect, because it's NOT a biopic: It's a cause movie.", ""], "rating": ["8/10", "4.0/4", "", "", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "3/4", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "B", "A-"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Joanne Laurier", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Nikki Baughan", "Matthew Lucas", "Micheal Compton", "Namrata Joshi", "Troy Patterson", "A.S.
