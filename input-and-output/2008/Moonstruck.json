{"metadata": {"synopsis": "No sooner does Italian-American widow Loretta (Cher) accept a marriage proposal from her doltish boyfriend, Johnny (Danny Aiello), than she finds herself falling for his younger brother, Ronny (Nicolas Cage). She tries to resist, but Ronny lost his hand in an accident he blames on his brother, and has no scruples about aggressively pursuing her while Johnny is out of the country. As Loretta falls deeper in love, she comes to learn that she's not the only one in her family with a secret romance.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Norman Jewison", "studio": "MetroGoldwynMayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 1, 2016", "box_office": "$80.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["While it leans a bit too heavily on the whimsy, Moonstruck is nevertheless a winning romantic comedy.", "With a sharply-written, Oscar-winning screenplay populated with compelling characters and an outstanding ensemble, Moonstruck goes beyond the typical rom-com trappings to deliver something a little more substantial than your standard entries in the genre.", "Moonstruck is regarded as one of the great romantic comedies of all time, but mio dio, it's truly the antidote to bad vibes.", "This uproarious exercise in accidental relationships, unveiled adultery, and coincidental prosperity is a grand romantic comedy that shouldn't be missed.", "It's wonderfully written and has just the right touch of sweeping romance that you need.", "The movie is pleasant, full of charm, entertaining, subtle, at times complicated, but always easy to follow. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Hinging on the lead performance of Cher - who won one of the three Oscars awarded to the film - it benefits from its very specific New York setting, its consistent sense of humor and its deep sense of romantic realism.", "Moonstruck is one of those movies you watch and say, \"they don't make them like that anymore.\" However, it's more than just a few laughs and iconic line readings. Its tight story structure and Cher's magnetic performance is hard to not get swept up in.", "I love Cher in this and her chemistry with Nicholas Cage is off the charts.", "Here, at last, is the kind of warm adult comedy that often eludes Hollywood an offbeat exploration of family, fidelity and the foibles of the human heart.", "Best performance ever by a musician transitioning from recording studio to silver screen? The incomparable Cher would have to go close here.", "At times funny and clever, Moonstruck asks the questions: what does it mean to be in love? and is it ever okay to settle?", "Jewison's point seems to be that love may not be perfect, but it can be sweet fun.", "This is a movie that makes you want to sing \"Boheme\" and walk in the moonlight and move to Brooklyn.", "You will not easily forget this incredibly robust family.", "An American movie with foreign-film sensibilities, Moonstruck's depths come from their perfect balance of writing and direction.", "Cher is simply wonderful, and the teaming with Cage an inspiration. The rest of the cast couldn't be better.", "It isn't great art -- it`s too closely concentrated on immediate emotional effect for that -- but it is highly sophisticated craftsmanship.", "No resistance could overcome the overfamiliarity of the situations in Moonstruck, the corniness of its dramaturgy or the banality of its message.", "There's an old-fashioned romanticism about the picture, a sweet, gentle approach to love and family life. But this is kept from seeming sappy by the picture's tough-minded, almost abrasive sense of humor."], "rating": ["3/4", "4/5", "", "9/10", "", "", "3/4", "5/5", "1", "", "4/5", "B+", "", "4/4", "4/4", "", "", "3/4", "1/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Matt Brunson", "Jeff Beck", "Matt Patches", "Mike Massie", "Anupama Chopra", "\u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez-Santos", "Mike Scott", "Karl Delossantos", "Rachel Wagner", "Linda Deutsch", "Leigh Paatsch", "Candice Frederick", "Cathy Burke", "Chris Chase", "Gene Siskel", "Sheila Benson", "Roger Hurlburt", "Dave Kehr", "Ben Yagoda", "Jay Boyar"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Frenzy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Blu Spot", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Polygon", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Companion", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times-Picayune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Smash Cut Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Talk Online", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">United Press International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel"], "date": ["November 27, 2020", "November 17, 2020", "October 8, 2020", "September 6, 2020", "May 18, 2020", "April 20, 2020", "March 30, 2020", "March 19, 2020", "February 28, 2019", "January 29, 2019", "October 19, 2018", "September 12, 2017", "November 8, 2016", "December 15, 2015", "February 7, 2014", "February 7, 2014", "February 7, 2014", "February 7, 2014", "February 7, 2014", "February 7, 2014"]}}
