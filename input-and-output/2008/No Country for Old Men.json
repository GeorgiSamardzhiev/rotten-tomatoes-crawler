{"metadata": {"synopsis": "While out hunting, Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) finds the grisly aftermath of a drug deal. Though he knows better, he cannot resist the cash left behind and takes it with him. The hunter becomes the hunted when a merciless killer named Chigurh (Javier Bardem) picks up his trail. Also looking for Moss is Sheriff Bell (Tommy Lee Jones), an aging lawman who reflects on a changing world and a dark secret of his own, as he tries to find and protect Moss.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 2m", "director": "Joel Coen, Ethan Coen", "studio": "ParamountVantage,Miramax,ScottRudinProductions", "theater_date": "Nov 21, 2007", "dvd_date": "Apr 21, 2016", "box_office": "$74.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Relentless in method, challenging in presentation, and unforgettable in execution.", "No Country for Old Men draws its characters as broad representations of human morality, which makes them all the more compelling.", "The greatest films are such a force of life and death, love and hate that once the closing credits begin to roll, the film's cinematic life has just begun.", "The Coen brothers deliver one hell of a modern western, with themes that resonate and characters that won't let you forget them. [Full review in Spanish]", "The Coen Brothers honor McCarthy by reproducing whole chunks of dialogue from the book, and judiciously trimming plot. Jones' plaintive mourning for a country that's become too complicated to police is enough for us to know why he's packing it in.", "With very little dialogue, Bardem is an imposing, evil presence who makes every scene he is in a white-knuckle moment.", "The Coen Brothers' vision was quite simply visionary, and still is.", "An unexpected sucker-punch of a movie - raw, gritty and deeply humanistic.", "The consequences are powerfully gripping as the Coens ratchet up the tension in a visceral thriller that ranks with their best work.", "It's a smart film and pure Coen. It has a point, though some may contest it. But it's not a must-see film for everyone so if you are a Coen fan, don't take your grandmother. She will say it sucks.", "The Coen Brothers are back with a triumphant return to form.", "No Country for Old Men is a great return to form for the Coens. Even if you've never been a big fan of theirs, it's a film you should see if you like a good thriller.", "The film clearly and finally represents the mainstream success that has long eluded the Coens. Longtime fans, fear not: This is no sell-out. There is still plenty of what the Coens do best.", "The Coens have returned... full of talent. [Full review in Spanish]", "No Country for Old Men is imbued with a dry, minimalist, almost crude style and forms a dark and violent universe that reveals the horror and moral rot rooted in American society. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The lack of respect for the body, the sheer bloody aftermath depresses me. Yes, they may handle the killing with verve and ironic tension, but this is a Coen brothers film too far.", "... a perfect match of story and storyteller.", "The road to doom is paved with blood and bad decisions in one of the best pictures of 2007.", "There's no denying the movie and this character's power to shake you.
