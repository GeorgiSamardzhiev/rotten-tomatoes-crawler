Diana (Joan Crawford) has a flamboyant personality that masks a sweet nature, while Ann (Anita Page) is outwardly reserved, but coldly manipulative on the inside. When Diana sets her sights on the rich, debonair Ben (Johnny Mack Brown), Ann gets competitive, and successfully steals Ben away from her. It's only after they've married that Ben realizes what a cruel person Ann is, and that his heart really belongs to Diana.", "rating": "66", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 24m", "director": "Harry Beaumont", "studio": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 5, 2018", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...gives Joan Crawford a crackerjack early role.", "[Our Dancing Daughters] is sumptuously mounted, gets plenty of playing from three girls and is sufficiently physically teasing."], "rating": ["3/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Josh Larsen", "Sid Silverman"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety"], "date": ["October 19, 2020", "July 22, 2008"]}}
