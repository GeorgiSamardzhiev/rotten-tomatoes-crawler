{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Private Tom Beddoes (Brian Stirner) is a delicate, unprepossessing young man who gets called to join the British army during World War II. With the Blitz on, he leaves home for training camp and, while not an exceptional soldier, is nevertheless toughened up a bit. Once out, he quietly endures the tedious shuffle of military life and even manages to meet a nice girl (Julie Neesam) while on leave. His happiness is alloyed, however, when he learns he's been chosen for the D-Day invasion.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 25m", "director": "Stuart Cooper", "studio": "Joswend", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 23, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An interesting failure, this rarely seen 1975 English feature about World War II combines documentary and fictional elements, though they tend to undermine each other.", "A glimpse of both the inner life of the soldier waiting for combat, and the literal reality of the most devastating war the world has ever seen.", "[...] Overlord's vision of war is still unlike that of any other fiction feature: more jarring, and more awe-inspiring.", "A film that slipped through the cracks.", "Fact and fiction endow each other with vitality and truth.", "Though not as aggressive as the freeform artistry of '70s contemporaries like Nicolas Roeg or Richard Lester, Cooper's film spins a hypnotic tone from flash-forwards, fantasy sequences, and dreamlike premonitions.", "An unknown classic.", "The actual war footage and fictional elements combine to create the illusion of a 1940s war movie that was never really made, in a 1970s war movie that was never released, for contemporary audiences during a time of war.", "Overlord feels like a small but vivid tragedy inside an epic container.", "The overriding themes of the film are never broadly stated but are subtly revealed, and the horror and reality of war are quietly played out on both the human and panoramic levels with disturbing effect.", "Though made 31 years after D-Day, the dramatic scenes have the period look of a '40s movie, which links them perfectly with the stunning archival footage.", "Overlord, a prize-winning entry in the 1975 Berlin Film Festival, deserves to join the pantheon of essential World War II combat movies.", "It's still a feat of period filmmaking. More than that, Overlord's revivification of a wasteland Europe offers up a powerful whip lesson for the postwar complacent.", "The film plays like a 1950's B-movie with artistic pretensions.", "Narratively, Cooper manages to give a moving, elegiac quality to this soldier's chronicle of a death foretold; and aesthetically... he brings out the strange, emotive beauty contained in these images of an economy of death.", "A majestic, somber work about war.", "Cooper gives it the right understated, unheroic feel.", "It's an extremely clever weave of components, combining, almost flawlessly, the dramatized and the archival, the result being a hybrid of forms.", "Combines its newsreel and fictional footage so effectively that it has a greater impact than all fiction, or all documentary, could have achieved."], "rating": ["", "4/5", "4/5", "A-", "4/5", "A-", "3.5/4", "3/4", "", "3.5/5", "3.5/4", "5/5", "", "C", "4/5", "", "", "", "4/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Tom Grieve", "Noel Murray", "Dennis Schwartz", "Peter Bradshaw", "Scott Tobias", "Jeffrey M.
