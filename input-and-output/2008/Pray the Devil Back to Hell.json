{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This documentary chronicles social unrest in the West African Republic of Liberia, where civil war has torn the nation apart and left hundreds of thousands dead or displaced. The film reconstructs the way this tragedy galvanized a coalition of Christian and Muslim women to rise up and, through nonviolent tactics, put pressure on their government to pursue peace talks. Director Gini Reticker follows their grassroots moment as it leads to democratic elections and Liberia's first female president.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Documentary/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 12m", "director": "Gini Reticker", "studio": "ForkFilms", "theater_date": "Nov 7, 2008", "dvd_date": "Sep 21, 2016", "box_office": "$79.0K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["For those unfamiliar with the true story, it is a remarkable one that powerfully brings to life the power of peace to overcome violence.", "The movie is clear-eyed and fearless in its recounting of the horrors of civil war, if also somewhat unsettling in demonstrating the power of documentary to desensitize viewers to even the most appalling atrocities.", "A glorious tribute to a bi-partisan sisterhood of Christian and Muslim women fed up with having to raise their children amidst the incessant slaughter, raping and looting of the Liberian civil war.", "Although filling the watcher with the same sort of outrage that inspired the women to stand up and be counted, this is, at heart, a testimony to the power of solidarity and sisterhood through a single purpose.", "[A] moving documentary about the tumultuous recent history of Liberia made by an all-female crew led by director Gini Reticker.", "It's an outstanding story, which makes up for Pray's moviemaking deficiencies.", "The film is brief and not especially creative in its storytelling, but nonetheless unforgettable; this remarkable story deserved to be captured on film.", "Limitations aside, it's highly stirring stuff.", "This illuminating film by director Gini Reticker and producer Abigail Disney is a much-needed attempt to put the spotlight on a moment of history that still inspires.", "A modest but effective work of documentary uplift.", "Pray the Devil Back to Hell is at once inspiring and horrific.", "Pray the Devil uses its brief 72 minutes to tell one of the truly heartening international political stories of recent years.", "The story of the women's groups -- Christian and Muslim, uniting for the first time in the nation's history -- is unbelievably inspiring.", "The film shows that the women's peace movement, propelled by ordinary citizens, changed what was possible in Liberia.", "Some political documentaries suffer from overselling the urgency of their agenda, but director Gini Reticker's Pray the Devil Back to Hell nicely underplays the significance of its subject.", "Inevitably, Reticker's style falls into monotony that works against the material. Ultimately, though, the power of that material overcomes flaws in presentation.", "Relates a powerful story with intelligence, concision and a minimum of distracting stylistic flourishes.", "Offers an inspiring portrait of conscientious citizens working to make a change. Yes they can, indeed.", "An economically told, extremely powerful story.", "Pray The Devil Back To Hell is overly conventional as a documentary, but it's inspiring as a rebuttal to the declining state of the world at large."], "rating": ["3.0/4", "3/5", "4/4", "4/5", "3.5/4", "3/4", "3/4", "", "4/4", "3/4", "3.5/4", "4.5/5", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "3.5/5", "4/5", "B"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Ben Kenigsberg", "Kam Williams", "Amber Wilkinson", "Gerald Peary", "Chris Hewitt", "Moira MacDonald", "Stan Hall", "Jonathan Curiel", "Wesley Morris", "Steven Rea", "Kenneth Turan", "Bob Strauss", "Cynthia Fuchs", "Tim Grierson", "Jay Antani", "Frank Scheck", "Geoff Berkshire", "Katey Rich", "Noel Murray"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out Chicago", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AALBC.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Eye for Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Phoenix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">St. Paul Pioneer Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Oregonian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Francisco Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Globe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">PopMatters", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">L.A.
