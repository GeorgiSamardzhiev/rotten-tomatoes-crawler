{"metadata": {"synopsis": "As an affluent New England family prepares for one daughter's wedding, another named Kym (Anne Hathaway) -- just out of her latest stint in rehab -- whirls into town causing upheaval.

But, in its own small and unassuming way, Rachel Getting Married is just that.", "By trimming away excess to an almost Dogma 95 degree of austerity, Demme and screenwriter Jenny Lumet...offer us a penetrating look into a deeply wounded family.", "A moving and reassuring experience if ever there was one, feels like a warm welcome home.", "The wedding scene, when it finally comes, seems to go on forever, with nothing really happening beyond an endless parade of dancers and musicians.", "This is a movie about emotional displacement during a celebration of unity, and the dissonance is devastating.", "The movie is one of the freshest, most original pictures to come out of Hollywood in a long time.", "I have been blown away by this movie...and not in a good way.", "[Jonathan] Demme plays with the style like a new toy, but the sensibility recalls his early ensemble films. He brings an inclusiveness and a sense of community to the film and gives characters we may only meet once a lived-in quality.", "Aside from this lovely fa\u00e7ade of racial harmony, your picture is really just another trite chick flick about sisterhood.", "If your image of Anne Hathaway is still that of a cute ing\u00e9nue, then you'll be shocked by her blistering performance as a wayward junkie emerging from rehab to attend her sister's wedding in Jonathan Demme's documentary-style family drama", "It's a common tale told like we've never heard it before. It's the melodrama Robert Altman never got to make. It's wonderful.", "Like a family reunion with its share of embarrassing moments, it may be worth attending all the same.", "Rachel Getting Married is an extraordinary achievement.", "Scarily real.", "Pulsates with life", "Like being forced to sit through an overly long wedding video in the living room of a couple you hardly even know.", "Kym crashes through her family and the weekend, careening off real and imaginary obstacles with a fierce yet still sympathetic rancor. It's the home movie you hope never to see of your life, impeccably filled with color and on-set live music and life and", "Only those who are willing to forego the many imperfections in the loosey-goosey script and Demme's improvisational style will feel the acting makes the film worth seeing.", "By the time the Ganesha cake is cut, you're left with the poodle as the only family member worthy of empathy."], "rating": ["", "5/5", "4/5", "3.5/4", "2/4", "", "", "D+", "", "", "", "A-", "4/5", "4.5/5", "3.5/4", "", "2.5/5", "4.5/5", "B-", "1.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Andrew Bloom", "Nikki Baughan", "David Harris", "Matthew Lucas", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Stephen Garrett", "Brian D.
