{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Frank (Leonardo DiCaprio) and April Wheeler (Kate Winslet) always see themselves as far-removed from the conventionality of suburbia. Yet that is exactly what creeps up on them when they buy a house in Connecticut. He toils 10 hours a day in a job he hates, while she, as a 1950s homemaker, yearns for fulfillment and passion. Rebelling against the torpor of their lives, the couple plan an escape that may push them to their limits.", "rating": "67", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "Sam Mendes", "studio": "NealStreetProductions,EvamereEntertainment,BBC", "theater_date": "Dec 26, 2008", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$22.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["In making a better man out of Frank Wheeler, Mendes and Haythe have, unfortunately, thrown out one of the real achievement's of Yates's novel: his ruthless critique of 1950s masculinity.", "Even the climax of the film is laughable, along with nearly every complementary sequence in which they bicker and yell continuously.", "A decent film that falls devastatingly short of anything resembling greatness.", "Maybe I would have been more willing to mull over that commentary if any piece of me had actually liked Frank and April Wheeler...", "Based on the 1961 novel by Richard Yates, there is a been-there, done-that feeling about the film.", "A powerful, wrenching piece of work and an acting showcase for a tremendous ensemble cast.", "This is a handsome, intelligent and careful adaptation which may be too bookish... Always fully engrossing, even if it is too coolly detached to ever be involving.", "Revolutionary Road shows something people think they want to see but really don't: what happens if Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet survive the Titanic.", "It just touched on so many different issues like love, the sanctity of marriage, forgiveness, rage, entrapment, loneliness and helplessness.", "Mr. Mendes at least has an idea what he should be going for even though he ultimately fails.", "There is not a shred of hope, light or even life in Mendes' fourth film.", "Revolutionary Road's portrait of a disintegrating marriage is so unflinching, so unsentimental, and so bleak, that you really need to be in a buoyant emotional state to get through the movie.", "Most of the way, the film feels more like a documentary about the couple than a corrosive study of either of them.", "These people are not tragic, they're not even pathetic - they're fountains of soap-opera profundities.", "From the director of American Beauty comes another empty, fake-meaningful tale of how rotten it is in the suburbs.", "... far beyond deconstructing the man in the gray flannel suit. ... [writer Richard Yates] explored ways we acquire and define our identities from people we love, and how we set our lives on self-deceptive and self-destructive courses.", "Revolutionary Road offers nothing you can't see on TV, with more compelling narratives and better performances (save for Michael Shannon).", "Mendes has made a troubling film that wrestles with big themes and touchy subjects, even if it is set in an overly familiar milieu.", "The characters in this film are weak-willed, pathetic losers. I just couldn't muster much sympathy for the characters that couldn't burst out of the cages of their own design.", "Revolutionary Road is content to stick with hoary cliches about the emptiness of middle-class bourgeois life."], "rating": ["", "2/10", "2.5/4", "", "1.5/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "A+", "", "1/5", "", "B+", "", "2/5", "", "5/10", "4/5", "2.5/5", "2/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Tammy Oler", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Ed Travis", "David Harris", "Matthew Lucas", "Deborah Ross", "A.S.
