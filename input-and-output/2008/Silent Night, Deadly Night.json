The toyshop scenes are perfect, a fantasia of Smurfs.", "Honestly, if you're a horror fan, Silent Night, Deadly Night should be an essential part of your Christmas rotation.", "Witless even by slasher-film standards.", "We're not knocking the transformation of a hallowed holiday figure into a homicidal maniac...it's the pleasure Billy and the movie take in leering at, then dicing up young women that lands Charles E. Sellier Jr.'s sicko Santa on our worst list.", "\"Silent Night, Deadly Night\" takes off from the notion that Santa Claus is an ax murderer, but it never quite lives up to the delicious perversity of its premise.", "If you're the sort who'll get a kick out of watching St. Nicholas hang a man with a string of Christmas lights, or impale a topless woman on a set of deer antlers, well, Silent Night, Deadly Night is definitely the film for you.", "The psycho Santa embodies Reagan-era conservatism, then at its peak, mocking the strict discipline of compassionless, law-and-order, moral-policing reactionaries...If the Gipper was post-Carter America's Santa Claus, he was also its Krampus.", "It had its moment and then vanished, like all garbage does.", "At least one of the better slasher films made in the States in the mid-'80s, though the degree to which that's an actual compliment is debatable.", "a brutal reminder that Christmas can have negative connotations for some", "Among the dozen or so victims of Santa's slay ride is a man who's choked to death with a string of Christmas lights and a young woman who's impaled--topless, of course--on a pair of moose antlers.", "killer santa", "Not only is the movie vile and callous, but also it's pretty darn stupid.", "the perfect stocking stuffer for misanthropic Scrooges."], "rating": ["3/5", "2/4", "", "3/5", "", "7/10", "", "", "1/4", "", "", "", "", "D", "5/10", "C", "", "2.5/4", "", "2.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Alix Turner", "David Nusair", "Anton Bitel", "Kat Hughes", "Rob Aldam", "Mike Massie", "Eve Tushnet", "Patrick King", "Matt Brunson", "Richard Corliss", "Paul Attanasio", "Austin Trunick", "Henry Stewart", "Rob Vaux", "Tim Brayton", "John A.
