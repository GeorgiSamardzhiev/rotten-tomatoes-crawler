{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Andrew Wyke (Michael Caine) is a highly successful mystery writer living in a beautiful and technologically advanced mansion in England. Milo Tindle (Jude Law) is an unsuccessful actor with decidedly less to show for his professional exploits. The lives of these two men cross paths when Andrew's wife leaves him for the younger Milo. Hoping to carry out a cleverly constructed revenge plot, Andrew invites Milo to his estate, where elaborate mind games ensue.", "rating": "36", "genre": "Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Kenneth Branagh", "studio": "TimnickFilms", "theater_date": "Oct 12, 2007", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$342.8K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Even without comparisons to previous iterations, it's difficult to appreciate the ludicrous twist that Branagh has inserted into this remake's final act.", "Branagh shrewdly stages much of the escalating second-act violence by having the men violate each other's personal space.", "While Caine is, without any doubt, absolutely the best thing in this Sleuth, as the film is entirely without purpose, so is his performance.", "It requires a light touch; I admire Branagh a great deal, but not for his light touch.", "Idly plotted then tempered by a blunt ending. All of a sudden the viewer is left pondering 'eh?' as Pinter apparently run out of room on his pad.", "", "Pinter's pauses, and the dour air of so much of the interplay, just don't fit on a story that's this slight.", "Once the homosexual subtext is brought to the surface, everything seems to be a joke. Are they gay, kidding, or just considering?", "Fans of the original should stay away.", "The script includes a verbal motif that reminds us of what binds the film's four central talents together: 'I want to show you something.' [Blu-Ray review]", "What this Sleuth lacks in enthusiasm it makes up in character-driven menace.", "Despite Branagh's every attempt to capitalise on the intimacy of the cinematic medium with (intrusive) close-ups, the direction is heavy handed; the result being a dramatic, but emotionally cold experience", "Goofy art house tendencies (including an ill-thought dalliance with homo-eroticism) trigger a few giggles, yet the clever, crisply-acted power struggle seizes your attention", "Director Kenneth Branagh has mercifully pared the action down to 88 minutes (the first movie dragged on for 138), but the final act... still seems to go on forever.", "What Pinter and Branagh present is a much more wicked, cold, disturbing film that is even more confined than the original.", "Seems to me that the Kenneth Branagh-Harold Pinter Sleuth is a pretty good movie. It just isn't a very good Sleuth, exactly.", "", "By the time the film ends on a flat note, it is long past the point of failing to effectively showcase a meeting of minds between two great actors.", "", "Whether you like the film probably depends on whether you can treat it all as seriously as Pinter and Branagh. If you can't, this short, brackish piece will not work at all, even if you don't regard it as a piece of piss."], "rating": ["3/10", "", "", "1/4", "2/5", "3/5", "2/5", "", "2.5/5", "3/4", "3/5", "", "B+", "", "4/5", "3/4", "3.5/5", "", "2/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "David Lamble", "Deborah Ross", "Walter Chaw", "Chris Laverty", "Jim Lane", "Alonso Duralde", "Brian Holcomb", "David Stratton", "Peter Canavese", "David Cornelius", "Urban Cinefile Critics", "Amy Nicholson", "J.
