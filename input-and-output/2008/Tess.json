But the picture is tame.", "(PODCAST) The greatest filmic literary adaptation any filmmaker has produced.", "Roman Polanski is one of those men who, despite his icky treatment of women in real life, manages to create strong and compelling female characters for the screen.", "This is Kinski's show and she flat out steals it.", "The film, like its source, is filled with pessimistic fatalism, but it spares no pity for the instruments of fate [...] What, if anything, this meant to Polanski remains unknowable.", "Unexciting.", "Insufferably long, but very good in parts.", "Visually, Tess is a masterpiece, capturing in amazing detail the scenery and atmosphere of the England of yore. The film's chief drawback, however, is its lack of vitality.", "Tess is a sensitive, intelligent screen treatment of a literary masterwork.", "Though not one of Polanski's best features, this adaptation of Thomas Hardy's challenging novel, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, is intelligent if flawed, but it's nice to look at due to excellent production values, particularly cinematography.", "Tess tells one rather more about its director's much publicised preoccupations than about Hardy's themes.", "", "This is a wonderful film.", "Polanski is entitled to one monstrously overlong period piece, and in Tess he acquits himself satisfactorily, though the film isn't nearly the equal of its counterparts", "", "Tess conveys the bleak determinism that makes this young woman's life so anguished."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "A+", "3/4", "7/10", "4/5", "B", "3/5", "3/4", "", "B", "", "3/5", "4/4", "3/5", "3/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Freedman", "Diana Goldfarb", "Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos", "Peter Ackroyd", "Pauline Kael", "Cole Smithey", "Matt Brunson", "Christopher Long", "Keith Phipps", "Dennis Schwartz", "", "", "Variety Staff", "Emanuel Levy", "", "Philip Martin", "Roger Ebert", "Christopher Null", "Jake Euker", "Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gannett News Service", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sojourner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Metropolis", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dissolve", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Sun-Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmcritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">F5 (Wichita, KS)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spirituality &amp; Practice"], "date": ["November 4, 2019", "August 15, 2019", "August 14, 2019", "March 26, 2018", "January 3, 2018", "August 31, 2017", "April 18, 2014", "March 6, 2014", "February 25, 2014", "February 6, 2014", "February 19, 2010", "February 19, 2010", "February 19, 2010", "January 8, 2007", "June 24, 2006", "February 7, 2005", "October 23, 2004", "October 3, 2004", "September 24, 2004", "January 29, 2004"]}}
