{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Vaudeville sisters \"Hank\" (Bessie Love) and Queenie Mahoney (Anita Page) take their act to the Broadway stage in New York when Eddie (Charles King), a professional song-and-dance man appearing in a new show, invites his girlfriend Hank to join him. Soon after, Eddie transfers his affections to Queenie, who attempts to do right by her sister by dating another man -- high society member Jock Warriner (Kenneth Thompson).

On the other hand, If the dramatic element were taken away, the film would still be appealing as a spectacular revue.", "Bessie Love has the opportunity of her life-time -- and she makes the most of it.", "Zowie! What a picture! Humor, drama, romance, action, thrill! And how!", "It should perhaps be remembered that many musicals contain darkness, deep cynicism, and even high tragedy.", "Although the audible devices worked exceedingly well in most instances, it is questionable whether it would not have been wiser to leave some of the voices to the imagination.", "A tedious musical comedy embedded in a routine story like a fly in celluloid.", "The first musical and sound film to win an Academy Award for Best Picture creaks from old age.", "Excellent bits of sound workmanship are that of camera and mike following Page and the heavy along the dance floor to pick up their conversation as they glide.", "First musical to win Academy Award reeks of mothballs, but is undeniably the basis of perhaps a hundred others.", "Mediocre performances and poorly-constructed musical numbers are the low points in this modestly interesting all-talking, all-singing production.", "...cinematic evolution long ago froze The Broadway Melody in Precambrian amber. But while the movie is hopelessly dated now, it was the bee's knees in its day.", "The first musical to win the Oscar, Broadway Melody is a weak song-and-dance picture, but at the time the movie was so popular that it launched a whole series", "It is abundantly clear that they had not yet figured out how to stage or shoot musical numbers for the screen.", "Its function as genre blueprint makes for quite the curiosity. More importantly, it also stands up quite well as a solid evening's entertainment.", "Mainly a curiosity for film buffs who want to see how musicals erupted in the early days of the talkie.", "Without taking the historical context into account it would be impossible to imagine that it won the Best Picture award. It surely must be the most frivolous film to ever hold that honor.", "The Broadway Melody won the Academy Award for the best picture of 1929, but I am at a total loss to explain how or why.", "Interesting only as an early sound curio."], "rating": ["1.5/5", "5/10", "", "", "", "", "", "", "C+", "", "2.5/5", "2/4", "", "C+", "2/5", "3/5", "3/5", "2.5/4", "", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tim Brayton", "Mike Massie", "SMH Staff", "Sunday Times Staff", "Irene Thirer", "Witney Seibold", "Mordaunt Hall", "TIME Staff", "Dennis Schwartz", "Sid Silverman", "TV Guide Staff", "Wesley Lovell", "Mark Bourne", "Emanuel Levy", "Michael W.
