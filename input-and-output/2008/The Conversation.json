One is Coppola's growing infatuation with the technical aspects of his subject... The other is a mystery story that thickens into ever greater contrivance, improbability, and opacity.", "Coming after the dark, sumptuous classicism of The Godfather, The Conversation's choppy, elliptical style looked almost like the work of a different filmmaker, one willing to take risks with new forms and techniques.", "The coldest, most alienated Hollywood film from an era of suspicion and anxiety, a time in American life when we realized that ordinary discourse had to be decoded, that the unseen forces controlling our lives were sinister, and knowledge was fragmentary.", "A tense psychological thriller. But dig deeper and you'll find the tragedy of Hackman's Harry Caul. His burden and his loneliness add a melancholic tone to the entire film amidst the commentary on technology and privacy that is all too relevant today.", "It proves, ten years early, in a compelling, chilling vision, how close we are to Orwell's 1984.", "I frankly don't quite know what to make of Francis Ford Coppola's new film, The Conversation, though I should hasten to add that I was fascinated by much of it.", "The Conversation, it's called, and it's a volcano of a movie, an absolute sensation. I liked it better even than The Godfather... The fun of seeing it for the first time is all your's and I envy you.", "Classic Coppola thriller has suspense, violence.", "Thanks to Walter Murch's keen, intuitive sound montage and Hackman's clammy, subtle performance, the movie captures [an] elusive and universal fear-that of losing the power to respond, emotionally and morally, to the evidence of one's own senses.", "A film OF the 1970s, The Conversation is rooted in the new American anxiety of the time, the idea that behind every ideal was a rotten, festering truth.", "The Conversation is for me the masterpiece of American cinema.", "Coppola may have made films of a more spectacular nature but here he makes a virtue of a introversion - so that the film's horror moment is all the more vibrantly terrible when set in relief.", "Coppola shows off his arty aspirations by doing for audio technology what Antonioni did for photography. But The Conversation is a different animal entirely, steering clear of the existential dilemmas in Antonioni's film and creating a character pi", "There's a strong case to be made for The Conversation being Coppola's greatest film. Which, when you consider what else he's made, is high praise indeed.", "A major artistic asset to the film -- besides script, direction and the top performances -- is supervising editor Walter Murch's sound collage and re-recording.", "", "Coppola manages to turn an expert thriller into a portrayal of the conflict between ritual and responsibility without ever letting the levels of tension subside or the complicated plot get muddled.", "A movie of real authority.", "This is one of Coppola's masterpieces, a prophetic film about paranoia, the growing role of technology in our daily lives, and the impossibility of privacy even in public spaces.", "A bleak and devastatingly brilliant film."], "rating": ["", "", "", "5/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "5/5", "4/4", "5/5", "9", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "A", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["John Simon", "Adam Nayman", "A.S.
