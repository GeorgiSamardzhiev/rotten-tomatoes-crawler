{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Scientist Bruce Banner (Edward Norton) desperately seeks a cure for the gamma radiation that contaminated his cells and turned him into The Hulk.

Still, I wouldn't write it off either as unwatchable.", "A movie that truly deserves to have \"Incredible\" restored to its title.", "In this follow-up to \"Bouncing Hulk,\" the Hulk can't have intercourse. Poor Hulk.", "An energised, and by turns spectacular, return for the tetchy one though, which suggests, particularly by its open-ended finale, that there is a healthy future in store for its temperamental protagonist.", "The Incredible Hulk is the best kind of summer popcorn movie. Just let loose your inner green geek and Hulk out.", "Before his initial transformation inside the bottling plant where he works, Banner warns, \"Something bad is about to happen.\" He's right.", "The climax is a bit of a yawn, but most of what precedes it is vigorous and sharp.", "It's disposable fun, best summed up by Banner himself when asked how he feels during his transformation: \"There's just too much noise... it's difficult to remember anything at all.\"", "A very standard summer actioner that delivers reasonably well, if straight down the middle, on audience expectations.", "Norton makes for a wiry, curious Bruce Banner. But you can tell from the film's tedium-inducing smackdowns that a different philosophy prevailed: the artificial Zen of video-game playing.", "A more satisfactory adaptation of the spirit of Stan Lee's Marvel character.", "An impressive blockbuster that does exactly what it says.", "Bloodier action than other comic book adventures."], "rating": ["5/10", "2.5/4", "2.5/5", "", "3/4", "4/10", "3.5/5", "6.5/10", "B+", "", "3/5", "A-", "", "", "3/5", "", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Leigh Paatsch", "Siddhant Adlakha", "Matthew Lucas", "Rachel Wagner", "Danielle Solzman", "Colby Bryant", "Zaki Hasan", "Leona Laurie", "Aaron Asadi", "Julie Washington", "Justin Stewart", "Tom Charity", "Ali Gray", "Brent Simon", "Joshua Rothkopf", "Wally Hammond", "Ben Rawson-Jones", "James Rocchi"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slashfilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">From the Front Row", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Solzy at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Colbybryant.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Zaki&#39;s Corner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Geek Girl Authority", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">SciFiNow", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cleveland Plain Dealer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Stop Smiling", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNN.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheShiznit.co.uk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Shared Darkness", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out Chicago", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Digital Spy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media"], "date": ["November 28, 2020", "September 12, 2020", "July 31, 2020", "December 15, 2019", "July 6, 2019", "April 29, 2019", "April 18, 2019", "December 8, 2018", "November 2, 2018", "August 29, 2018", "September 8, 2017", "August 17, 2017", "January 19, 2015", "April 14, 2013", "October 14, 2012", "May 15, 2012", "May 4, 2012", "November 18, 2011", "July 14, 2011", "December 19, 2010"]}}
