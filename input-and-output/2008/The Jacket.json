{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Amnesiac Gulf War veteran Jack Starks (Adrien Brody) can't explain why he's been found at the scene of a murder. Ordered to a mental hospital, Jack is subjected to Dr. Thomas Becker's (Kris Kristofferson) unusual treatment plan, which involves mysterious injections, sensory deprivation and confinement in a straitjacket. Locked away on his own, Jack discovers he can travel to the future, where he's compelled to help a onetime acquaintance (Keira Knightley) and investigate his own odd fate.", "rating": "44", "genre": "Drama/Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "John Maybury", "studio": "MandalayPictures,SectionEightLtd.", "theater_date": "Mar 4, 2005", "dvd_date": "Dec 1, 2010", "box_office": "$6.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The Jacket is definitely one of those jumbles of a movie that I would normally rail against. And yet, in this case, the film still somehow manages to hang together as whole.", "The film is energetic. But with a rather conventional love story at its heart -- not particularly convincingly acted by Brody and Knightley -- this is one jacket that doesn't fit.", "Smart thriller is for mature older teens only.", "", "Maybury is an artist in addition to a director and it's clear that he has an eye for colour, which he uses cleverly to reinforce emotion.", "A morose and bleached-looking affair, with depressing music by Brian Eno to match.", "There's nothing wrong with a little vicarious experience when you go to the movies, but the director seems to think that his supernatural psycho thriller has to drive you crazy, just to get what it's like to be really insane.", "A solid attempt to wrestle with some big questions. The cast is exemplary and the premise and script are well reasoned and artful. But it doesn't quite come together.", "Tadjenin seems to draw inspiration from two books: \"10 ways to copy 12 Monkeys\" --a far inferior read to \"10 ways to write 12 Monkeys\"-- and \"Common Sense: A Stranger\"", "", "As incoherent as it is enjoyable, The Jacket hits the marks that it set out to, yet leaves the audience a bit cold with its squeaky clean ending.", "The only real scares here take place as images in Brody's head when he hallucinates under Dr. Becker's treatment. The rest of the film has a somewhat sappy quality to it and doesn't deliver any suspense or thrills of any kind.", "film whose quality defies its script", "Conta com conceitos interessantes, embora demore um pouco mais do que deveria para revel-los para o espectador.", "Ambitious-verging-on-pretentious screenplay adroitly lensed by a director with impressive formal command.", "It doesn't wash - they just end up with hogwash...", "", "What we get is mostly a convoluted tale that tries hard to seem far more important than it is.
