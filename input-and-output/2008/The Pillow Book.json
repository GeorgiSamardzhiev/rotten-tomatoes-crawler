Sex is a visual art, Greenaway says, and writing is a matter of life and death.", "It is exciting that in an age of mass book signings and disrespect for literature, Greenaway is able to sexualize the author's signature as it sweeps up a woman's neck.", "Greenaway provides a visual feast, then he kills your appetite.", "The Pillow Book is an experiment in the potential of film. It rejects convention and asks the viewer to forget traditions and entrenched assumptions. Those willing to go along will be hypnotized.", "Greenaway is a dedicated aesthete and sensualist who creates his own little worlds of cruelty, delight and artistic trickery. With tremendous brio and skill, he cuts his patterns into our minds, tickling our skins with his brush.", "I can, with many reservations, recommend The Pillow Book for graphic artists and, of course, for Star Wars completists. People who simply can't get enough nudity might also want to take a look.", "A surprisingly humane, satisfying film.", "Seductive eye candy masquerading as thought-provoking art cinema.", "Pillow Book may be a dull, heartless, cruel film, but for what it's worth, it looks marvelous.", "The Pillow Book is erotica for bookworms. Its poetic story is told brush stroke by brush stroke, in calligraphy painted on naked bodies and in the \"pillow book\" or diary of Nagiko (Vivian Wu).", "Extraordinary. Ravishing. Preposterous.", "A lavish, sensual and endlessly fascinating film that almost fetishes fetishism, this is provocative in every sense.", "The Pillow Book is obsessed with obsessive erotic obsessiveness. If you've ever trembled at the thought of having Japanese characters painted on your nude body, this is the film for you. Bring a lunch; it feels like it'll never end.", "Greenaway is a unique filmmaker in that he layers images upon one another in a single frame and doesn't require dialogue to make his films arresting.", "At first daunting but ultimately awesomely impressive and beautiful.", "A very intimate, sensual film, and a torrid, lurid melodrama, full of passion, jealousy, hatred and revenge.", "Yawn.", ""], "rating": ["3/5", "", "", "3/4", "", "3/4", "3.5/4", "", "", "2.5/5", "", "3.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "2/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "Lisa Alspector", "Richard Corliss", "Jami Bernard", "Leah Rozen", "Desmond Ryan", "Michael Wilmington", "Jay Boyar", "Keith Phipps", "Maitland McDonagh", "Rod Dreher", "Chris Kridler", "Tom Hutchinson", "", "Paul Tatara", "Gene Siskel", "David Stratton", "Tom Charity", "Cole Smithey", "Emanuel Levy"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNN.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com"], "date": ["October 27, 2020", "May 2, 2016", "May 2, 2016", "May 2, 2016", "May 2, 2016", "May 2, 2016", "May 2, 2016", "May 2, 2016", "May 2, 2016", "May 2, 2016", "May 2, 2016", "May 2, 2016", "May 2, 2016", "May 2, 2016", "May 2, 2016", "May 2, 2016", "March 26, 2009", "June 24, 2006", "March 13, 2006", "July 16, 2005"]}}
