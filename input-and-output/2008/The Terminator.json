{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Disguised as a human, a cyborg assassin known as a Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) travels from 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor (Linda Hamilton). Sent to protect Sarah is Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn), who divulges the coming of Skynet, an artificial intelligence system that will spark a nuclear holocaust. Sarah is targeted because Skynet knows that her unborn son will lead the fight against them. With the virtually unstoppable Terminator in hot pursuit, she and Kyle attempt to escape.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "James Cameron", "studio": "PacificWestern", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 5, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Never has a role been so perfectly sculpted for the Austrian bodybuilder, who possesses a powerful screen presence with little more than his menacing silhouette.", "Though the production design is a bit flimsy at times, both the big ideas at work and director James Cameron's brilliance as a proactive, inventive filmmaker generate a powerful flow that cannot help but sweep viewers totally away.", "Sarah Connor's origin feels real and grounded in a way that most (super)hero stories never manage. She doesn't have wealth or fame. She doesn't get dosed with super juice.", "A fantastic blend of horror, action, and sci-fi.", "Normally, Schwarzenegger's wooden on-screen presence is laughably bad, but his limited range works perfectly in this role.", "Forget that the premise is silly and the acting second-rate because director James Cameron has the action formula down pat.", "\"The Terminator\" brings film violence into the realm of the surreal.", "Those nightmares we've all had about being chased by some relentless, unstoppable monster? This is the movie adaptation.", "Much of Terminator's greatness is due to its low-budget aesthetic and lo-fi energy; perhaps out of necessity, Cameron's sense of storytelling has a lean efficiency that both he and the series have long since abandoned.", "You almost forget the film's flaws - like the cartoony look of the war-ravaged future. Here, the most absurd excursion is believable and we go along willingly - stopping now and then for a breath or a laugh.", "The havoc makes for a genuine steel metal trap of a movie that may very well be the best picture of its kind since The Road Warrior.", "Getting the extraordinary physical specimen of Arnold Schwarzenegger for the lead was a stroke of genius and a stroke of fortune. Each of his pecs is the size of a bull's flank.", "Damn close to perfect.", "Cameron maintains the heedless, non sequitur pace of a nightmare without resorting to cheap tactics. The frights of these nightmares, those cracked reflections of reality, hardly feel manufactured or inauthentic. And neither does \"The Terminator.\"", "Wittily written with a nice eye for sharp detail, it's hard sci-fi action all the way.", "A nerve-bludgeoning, relentlessly exciting action movie masterpiece.", "[Cameron] keeps things under control nicely, though, right through the final confrontation.", "Still a toss-up between The Terminator and Aliens as to which James Cameron picture ranks as his best, this propulsively exciting yarn about a murderous cyborg has long staked its claim as a classic -- science fiction or otherwise -- for the ages.", "Still one of the most harrowing science fiction films in James Cameron's repertoire...", ""], "rating": ["9/10", "3.5/5", "", "A", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "5/5", "5/5", "4.5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "", "4/4", "", "B+"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Leigh Paatsch", "Emily Asher-Perrin", "Sean Chandler", "Jennifer Lind-Westbrook", "Michael Blowen", "Paul Attanasio", "Josh Larsen", "Jason Bailey", "Hank Gallo", "Kirk Ellis", "Peter Bradshaw", "Tom Huddleston", "Nick Rogers", "Alan Jones", "", "", "Matt Brunson", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Emanuel Levy"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tor.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sean Chandler Talks About", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Culturess", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Globe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flavorwire", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Yap", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com"], "date": ["September 8, 2020", "May 12, 2020", "November 25, 2019", "October 2, 2019", "July 4, 2019", "April 27, 2018", "January 4, 2018", "May 18, 2017", "May 28, 2016", "October 26, 2015", "October 3, 2015", "June 25, 2015", "June 15, 2015", "October 30, 2014", "April 1, 2014", "April 1, 2014", "April 1, 2014", "February 23, 2013", "February 18, 2013", "January 15, 2013"]}}
