{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Aging wrestler Randy \"The Ram\" Robinson (Mickey Rourke) is long past his prime but still ready and rarin' to go on the pro-wrestling circuit. After a particularly brutal beating, however, Randy hangs up his tights, pursues a serious relationship with a long-in-the-tooth stripper (Marisa Tomei), and tries to reconnect with his estranged daughter (Evan Rachel Wood). But he can't resist the lure of the ring and readies himself for a comeback.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 50m", "director": "Darren Aronofsky", "studio": "ProtozoaPictures,WildBunch", "theater_date": "Dec 17, 2008", "dvd_date": "Dec 12, 2015", "box_office": "$26.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A grittily stark and oftentimes sadly humorous look into the life of a lamentable man and his tragic profession.", "The battered dignity of Rourke's performance is so touching that by the time he makes his big statement of faith to his fans even the toughest and most cynical of viewers will find their eyes going moist.", "It is powerful, yet it is graceful.", "The Wrestler is an astounding portrait of a broken man.", "But this is, of course, [Mickey] Rourke's moment. As the increasingly desperate and bewildered Ram he is aggressive and vulnerable, frightening and sympathetic as he struggles to find a place in a world that's leaving him behind.", "Rourke has risen again and delivered a performance for the ages.", "It's unfathomable to imagine The Wrestler without Rourke... It's one of those rare cinematic experiences where an actor and a role come together in perfect harmony.", "...the real-life horror of professional wrestling is evident in the ruined bodies of Randy and his peers...", "Rourke doesn't just make good on the promise of his early work; he makes a miracle.", "A story of personal ruin and while it certainly does echo Mickey's own life, it wouldn't be fair to say he is playing himself. Sure, Rourke's performance must have been informed by his own past, but that is different, as well as peculiarly powerful.", "With another director, and most tellingly, with hundreds of other actors, The Wrestler might easily have descended into clich\u00e9.", "Great performances, great story.", "A quarter-century (and, one senses, a lot longer in Rourke Years) since he pulled the popcorn-bag trick on Carol Heathrow and then talked his way back into her good graces, we'll still forgive Mickey Rourke anything.", "The most interesting aspect of the film is its depiction of the irreconcilable difference between someone's public and private personae.", "As the film points out, wrestling may be fixed, but it certainly ain't fake. This may be a film, but it certainly ain't fake either.", "Darren Aronofsky's filmmaking in The Wrestler is the most subtle and nuanced he's ever done.", "The movie is populated with real wrestlers, and it makes sure to nail all the little details.", "Emotional and engaging, The Wrestler is a masterful piece of work that deserves every award the Academy can throw at it.", "", ""], "rating": ["7/10", "", "4.0/4", "", "5/5", "3.5/4", "A", "7/10", "", "", "", "A", "", "", "5/5", "A", "A-", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Jason Best", "Richard Propes", "Felicia Feaster", "Nikki Baughan", "Matthew Lucas", "Micheal Compton", "Sarah Boslaugh", "Scott Raab", "Deborah Ross", "Dan DiNicola", "Candice Frederick", "Mark Asch", "Martin Tsai", "Simon Miraudo", "Christopher Runyon", "Will Leitch", "Ali Gray", "Hank Sartin", "Joshua Rothkopf"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">What&#39;s On TV", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Charleston City Paper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Roll Credits", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">PopMatters", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Esquire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Daily Gazette (Schenectady, NY)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Talk Online", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Stop Smiling", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Critic&#39;s Notebook", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Quickflix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Mezzanine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Deadspin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheShiznit.co.uk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out"], "date": ["November 28, 2020", "November 15, 2020", "September 27, 2020", "January 27, 2020", "November 4, 2019", "June 6, 2019", "May 22, 2019", "November 3, 2018", "October 17, 2018", "August 29, 2018", "February 5, 2018", "March 21, 2017", "May 17, 2016", "October 7, 2015", "October 21, 2014", "February 20, 2014", "June 22, 2013", "September 29, 2012", "November 18, 2011", "November 17, 2011"]}}
