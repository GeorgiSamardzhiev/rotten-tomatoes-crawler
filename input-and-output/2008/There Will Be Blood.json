[Full review in Spanish]", "There Will Be Blood needs no defense as a modern cinema classic.", "Anderson's unique vision and fresh voice are combining to redefine what it means to be an American filmmaker.", "Ambition and capitalism is taken to the extreme, where no one, including family and loved ones, will stand in the way of a man driven to insanity by his success.", "Sometimes a filmmaker makes that unexpected leap to the top of his craft. Blood is Paul Thomas Anderson's Raging Bull.", "A superb performance in one great depiction of greed and evil. [Full review in Spanish].", "There Will Be Blood was so good that it's making me rethink those last three PTA features.", "An amazing study of greed and corruption, expertly crafted by Anderson. The cinematography is breathtaking and the score by Jonny Greenwood is mesmerizingly original", "Though Day-Lewis seethes juicily, under the weight of all that allegory, Plainview steadily grows more vicious and less fascinating, wasting away to just a cackle and an empty leer.", "Towering, unrelenting filmmaking, a visionary masterwork for the ages, and the very best film of 2007.", "The sprawling, dark epic hinges on atmospherics and the moody air. It's heightened further by the ominous music, especially in the long, wordless opening sequence set in the mines with man pitted against nature.", "There's little subtlety to be found in this immensely entertaining slab of bloody red meat; both Anderson and Day-Lewis go for broke. But it's a pleasure to be reminded, if only once every four years, that subtlety can be overrated.", "[PTA] had way too much confidence in his own talent. But after watching the movie, I failed to forget its images, to stop thinking about its plot, to silence its soundtrack. It's possible that the director has a correct assessment of his artistic worth.", "Day-Lewis's performance will simply have you like a fever you can't shift. The landscapes are hard and big, but he scathes through them as if they were no more than your Uncle Stan's allotment.", "\"Blood,\" which isn't really as violent as its title suggests, is alternately annoying and exhilarating. In either case, it is a work of art that is required viewing for those interested in serious filmmaking.", "We find someone embracing the strange; dedicating not just a film to it, but letting it, for the most, and brilliant, part letting that strangeness move and alter the film in frustrating, tantalizing, and often unknown and unknowable ways.", "[There is] a jaw-dropping, annihilating ending to a bold, deeply American, success story."], "rating": ["", "", "1", "5/5", "", "4.0/4", "", "", "4/4", "", "A", "3/4", "4/4", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Scott Nye", "Mike Massie", "Luis Mart\u00ednez", "Leigh Monson", "Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "David Lamble", "Federico Furzan", "Angela L.
