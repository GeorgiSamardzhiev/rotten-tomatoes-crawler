{"metadata": {"synopsis": "On a seemingly ordinary day, Joe Turner (Robert Redford), a quiet CIA codebreaker, walks into his workplace and finds that all of his coworkers have been murdered. Horrified, Joe flees the scene and tries to tell his supervisors about the tragedy. Unfortunately, he soon learns that CIA higher-ups were involved in the murders. With no one to trust, and a merciless hit man (Max von Sydow) close on his tail, Joe must somehow survive long enough to figure out why his own agency wants him dead.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Mystery & Suspense/Romance", "runtime": "1h 57m", "director": "Sydney Pollack", "studio": "ParamountPictures,DinodeLaurentiisCorp.,WildwoodEnterprises", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 23, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...it narrows its focus entirely to the cat-and-mouse chase at its core, boiling its post-Watergate theme of governmental indifference to human life down to the relationship between two professionals...", "As all the pieces begin coming together, the resolution slows, flawing the pacing that had started so smartly.", "What we are given is more than worth seeing.", "A piece of dotty, slightly paranoid intrigue.
