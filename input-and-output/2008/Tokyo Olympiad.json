{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This impressionistic portrait of the 1964 Tokyo Summer Olympics pays as much attention to the crowds and workers as it does to the actual competitive events. Highlights include an epic pole-vaulting match between West Germany and America, and the final marathon race through Tokyo's streets. Two athletes are highlighted: Ethiopian marathon runner Abebe Bikila, who receives his second gold medal, and runner Ahamed Isa from Chad, representing a country younger than he is.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Art House & International/Documentary/Sports & Fitness", "runtime": "2h 50m", "director": "Kon Ichikawa", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 10, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Ichikawa's movie is not only exciting but excited in documenting...", "This 3-hour film isn't the same as watching an afternoon of Olympic activity on American television, since Ichikawa isn't particularly interested in winners or stats or medal counts by country.", "Even if, like me, you have a hard time forgetting how corrupt and damaging the Olympics are, Tokyo Olympiad will remind you that the games themselves are something special.", "[Kon Ichikawa is] equally concerned with defeat as he is with victory, finding a compassionate nobility in the losers and their need to compete and struggle in the face of impossible odds.", "I was prepared, but wondered vaguely how Ichikawa could hold the interest of the audience for almost three hours. Believe me, that he does.", "", "It is as welcome -- even if mainly to track and movie buffs -- as the finish line is to a marathon runner.", "", "Ichikawa's 1965 documentary of the 1964 Tokyo Olympics is a document not just of an event but also of a time and place and a culture.", "Tokyo Olympiad is a stunning testament - both to the Olympic athletes it focuses on, and the craft of artistic documentary filmmaking.", "'Despite the unnecessary preaching of peace and brotherhood, Ichikawa truly captures a far more intimate portion of Olympic spirit than recorded anywhere else'", "The torch-bearer running across the screen, as Mount Fuji fills the background, stands as one of the most profoundly moving shots in cinematic history.", "a visual marvel of cinematic techniques, many of which were groundbreaking at the time in terms of what was acceptable for a sports documentary", "Though it's visually choppy, with some disruptive zooms, the 'Scope format matches the subject's scale, and Ichikawa's emphasis on shared human experience is compelling.", "An epic study of athletes struggling, against their own bodies and each other, to excel. But it reaches even further, as a stirring portrait of fleeting human hopes.", "By plunging us into the action, Ichikawa creates a unique intimacy between athlete and audience. Even after countless hours of watching televised sports, the effect is revelatory."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "", "1", "", "3/5", "4/5", "5/5", "", "8", "B", "4.5/5", "4/4", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["J.
