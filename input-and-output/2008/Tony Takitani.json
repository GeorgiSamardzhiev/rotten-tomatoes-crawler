[Full review in Spanish]", "Jun Ichikawa manages to capture the novel's essence in his film to the highest degree, and in that fashion, presents a very impressive film. Particularly fans of Murakami will definitely enjoy it.", "Scarcely satisfies, yet it lingers -- limpidity of image along with imperceptible epiphanies", "Ichikawa brilliantly captures Murakami's blend of whimsy, irony and melancholy, while finding intelligent and inventive ways to convert the author's verbal idiosyncrasies to a visual medium.", "This could reverently be called a model of minimalism, but I am more inclined to call it dull as dishwater.", "", "For those wanting to plumb deeper existential truths, or who simply want to bathe in visual poetry, the film is a strong enough reason to get out of the house.", "", "Filme de construo potica e delicada, encanta pelo tocante estudo de personagens e por discutir, atravs de seus quadros reveladores, temas complexos como a solido, a natureza da memria, fetiches e obsesses.", "An impressive achievement.", "", "", "Jun Ichikawa's slight, lovely little drama understands the pleasure of seeing, using many quiet, patient takes to absorb its delicate visuals.", "embodies that lose-lose conundrum we all face: loneliness is painful, but finding and then losing love is just as bad", "Ichikawa evokes the heady and suffocating effect of the past playing irrevocable catch-up with itself.", "It's a serene experience, letting the film wash over you and transport you into its isolated, melancholy little world.", "it's a hypnotic mood piece on love and loss, one that knows -- at 75 minutes -- not to overstay its welcome.", "The Japanese movie is tranquil, smoothly connecting its scenes with gradual pans from one image to the next, accompanied by spare music that sounds like early morning and loneliness.", "An ethereal modern fable without a moral, Tony Takatani seeps into the soul and lingers.
