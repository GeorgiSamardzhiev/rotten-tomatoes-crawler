[Full review in Spanish]", "[Alan Moore] is probably going to wish he had allowed his name in the credits alongside artist David Lloyd, because V for Vendetta has survived the transition to the big screen with its bite intact.", "With such a revolutionary attitude, big themes and incendiary topics, it's amazing how bland the final product of the film can be.", "A bizarre, farcical, political allegory-cum-thriller.", "Although V for Vendetta doesn't have the sneaky pop sophistication of at least the first Matrix film, it does often deliver its hokum with quite a bit of flair.", "If the secret police ever want to get anything out of me, all they have to do is sit me down in front of this film. I'd tell them I was the third man on the grassy knoll just to make them switch it off.", "In the face of this film something adolescent in me surged to the surface and I mean that as a great compliment: adolescence is a state I hold in high regard.", "V for Vendetta, based on a graphic novel, is sabotaged by its second half, which is more like V for vacuous.
