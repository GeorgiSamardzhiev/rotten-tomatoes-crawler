{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Israeli filmmaker Ari Folman wrote, directed and stars in this autobiographical animated film. As a 19-year-old infantry soldier in the 1982 war with Lebanon, Folman witnessed the Sabra and Shatila massacre, but realizes that he has no memory of the event. In 2006, he seeks out others who were in Beirut at the time to discuss their memories, including a psychologist specializing in post-traumatic stress disorders and the first journalist to cover the massacre.", "rating": "96", "genre": "Animation/Art House & International/Documentary/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Ari Folman", "studio": "T\u00e9l\u00e9visionSuisse-Romande(TSR),ArteFrance,RadioT\u00e9l\u00e9visionBelgeFrancophone(RTBF),RazorFilmProduktionGmbH,SBS,LesFilmsd&#39;Ici,MedienboardBerlin-Brandenburg,IsraelFilmFund", "theater_date": "Dec 25, 2008", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$2.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A very powerful film about the horrors of war and the corrosive effects of dehumanization, told with a fast paced and splendid animation style.

The composition, pace and tenor is nothing short of brilliant.", "Dreams are central to this shattering, not-to-be-missed animated Israeli documentary, which opens on a gothic note that suggests a particularly macabre graphic novel or the corrosive pessimism of film noir.", "A powerful rumination on war's human toll, crafted with a unique and singular eye.", "A brave, damning and riveting piece of cinema that deserves to find an audience.", "A sensitive, remarkable piece of work that presents a devastating part of history in a way that never feels inappropriate, rather, it feels essential.", "(Waltz With Bashir turns) the recollections and re-enactments of the war into visually stunning works of art (and) will leave you utterly devastated.", "Waltz with Bashir brilliantly echoes its cultural investigations with its formal contradictions.", "The movie's aesthetic and narrative confusion are as much products of a muddled, if just barely successful, approach as it is of Folman's search among the ruins of his memory.", "As hypnotic as the animation is, it distracts from the film's clear problems.", "The flatness of the Flash animation keeps visual bombast to a minimum, even during surreal interludes.", "Every scene fizzes and crackles with creative charisma as we are carried on an emotional journey of epic proportions.", "Despite the director's refusal to come to terms with Israel's role in the Sabra-Shatila massacre, this is a pacifist film that ranks with \"Platoon\" and other classics.", "Persepolis meets Full Metal Jacket in Ari Folman's powerful and original animated war film.", "Waltz with Bashir uses vivid, hand-drawn animation to bring to life interviews Folman conducted with friends who were involved in the Lebanese war in the early 1980s.", "These depictions of the dementia of war have a hallucinatory power that can stand alongside those of Apocalypse Now.", "The message of the futility of war has rarely been painted with such bold strokes.", "Waltz With Bashir is done with considerable artistry and intelligence. The images are deeply disturbing, hallucinatory ...", "[This] investigation into the dark regions of horror, culpability, and memory is all the more powerful because of his film's rueful hilarity.", "Folman's use of animation permits an audience to engage with the events, such as they are recalled, in a way that the simple testimony of those involved could not achieve."], "rating": ["8/10", "3.5/4", "", "3.5/4", "4/5", "5/5", "5/5", "", "", "C", "4/5", "5/5", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "", "4/4", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Yasser Medina", "Tom Meek", "Felicia Feaster", "Matthew Lucas", "Kaleem Aftab", "Cameron Frew", "Matt Neal", "Michael Atkinson", "Michael Joshua Rowin", "Will Leitch", "Ben Kenigsberg", "Mike Edwards", "Louis Proyect", "Liam Lacey", "Kim Voynar", "David Ansen", "Mary Corliss", "David Walsh", "Peter Keough", "Amber Wilkinson"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cambridge Day", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Charleston City Paper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">From the Front Row", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The List", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">FrewFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ABC Radio (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">In These Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Stop Smiling", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Deadspin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out Chicago", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">What Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rec.arts.movies.reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Globe and Mail", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinematical", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Phoenix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Eye for Film"], "date": ["December 2, 2020", "August 14, 2020", "January 27, 2020", "June 6, 2019", "November 4, 2018", "October 31, 2018", "January 25, 2018", "April 18, 2016", "April 7, 2015", "June 22, 2013", "February 17, 2012", "March 24, 2011", "October 6, 2010", "September 14, 2010", "July 6, 2010", "July 6, 2010", "July 6, 2010", "July 6, 2010", "July 6, 2010", "July 6, 2010"]}}
