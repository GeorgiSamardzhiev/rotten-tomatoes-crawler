{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Recent MIT grad Matt Franklin (Topher Grace) should be well on his way to a successful career at a Fortune 500 company, but instead, he rebels against maturity by taking a job at a video store.

With the help of his twin sister (Anna Faris) and his best friend (Dan Fogler), Matt hatches a plan to change the course of his life.", "rating": "28", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 29m", "director": "Michael Dowse", "studio": "RoguePictures", "theater_date": "Mar 4, 2011", "dvd_date": "Jul 18, 2011", "box_office": "$6.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["\"Take Me Home Tonight\" isn't anything original.
