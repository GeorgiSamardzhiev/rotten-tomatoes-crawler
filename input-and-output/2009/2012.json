Do yourself a favor, watch \"2012\" and feel the circuitry of your brain melt into a steaming ball of flaming wreckage.", "Wears out its welcome at a ridiculous two hours and 40 minutes, throwing out every clich\u00e9 in the disaster movie handbook.", "An overlong, overindulgent action film that wants to be fun and exciting, but is really rather dull and exhausting.", "2012 is all about this irrational determination to live and perpetuate our crappy civilization. The film concentrates fiercely on who's going to get a spot on the ark in the end.", "...seriously, how often do we want to escape into worlds that are hell-bent on ravaging our sense of security with invading aliens and furious natural disasters?", "You cannot say, in the terms of the life and career that Emmerich has built for himself, this is not the apex of his work. The world blows up. The world blows up a lot. The world blows up fantastically. There are worst quests in life.", "Emmerich favours hoisting his camera high and dry to give audiences the best panoramic view, but it removes all tension from proceedings - you're always at a safe distance.", "", "", "Two and a half hours of heaving and cleaving and crashing and crunching.", "Cusack, with his one-of-the-guys face and his nice way with child actors, does creditable work as an Average American Dad trying to put things right.", "2012 is the rare case of a bad film that I'm nevertheless obliged to recommend you see.", "Most of all, I liked the airlifting of giraffes to ark safety via helicopter and the bizarrely unreasonable cheeriness of the beleaguered survivors who all but shout \"hip-hip-hooray\" after billions of other Earth citizens lose their lives.", "Over the top scenes of destruction aside 2012 is generally unimaginative in every way, from conception to execution. It's not particularly bad, but never has the end of the world seemed so quaint.", "At points, 2012 was tedious enough to make us feel like we were in the theater until 2012", "A headache inducing mess of apocalyptic proportions, 2012 is a woeful greatest hits package of disaster film clich\u00e9s, mixed with shallow social commentary.", "In line with the U.S.-centric heartbeat of 2012, most other nationalities, particularly the Russians, are viewed as imbeciles and/or mere extensions of crude stereotypes - clever Indians, honourable Chinese, stylish Italians, and so on."], "rating": ["5/10", "", "2.5/4", "A", "1/4", "C", "", "2/4", "B", "3/5", "1/5", "2/5", "2/5", "B", "B-", "4.5/5", "5/10", "2/5", "1.5/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Jason Best", "Richard Propes", "Brent McKnight", "Matthew Lucas", "Micheal Compton", "Eileen Jones", "David Keyes", "Will Leitch", "Ali Gray", "Ben Kenigsberg", "Joshua Rothkopf", "Neil Pond", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Laremy Legel", "Dave White", "Joshua Starnes", "Kamal  &#39;The Diva&#39; Larsuel", "Matthew Pejkovic", "Simon Foster"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Talk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The eXile", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaphile.org", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Deadspin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheShiznit.co.uk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">American Profile", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ComingSoon.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">3BlackChicks Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Matt&#39;s Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">sbs.com.au"], "date": ["November 28, 2020", "November 25, 2020", "September 24, 2020", "July 14, 2020", "June 6, 2019", "May 11, 2019", "October 30, 2018", "June 29, 2013", "June 22, 2013", "September 29, 2012", "November 18, 2011", "November 17, 2011", "September 30, 2011", "September 7, 2011", "May 6, 2011", "April 4, 2011", "March 3, 2011", "September 28, 2010", "August 20, 2010", "August 9, 2010"]}}
