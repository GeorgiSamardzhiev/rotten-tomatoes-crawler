{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This acclaimed crime drama follows Malik El Djebena (Tahar Rahim), a delinquent young Muslim man, who is struggling to get by in a French prison. When he is taken under the wing of powerful Corsican mob boss Cesar Luciani (Niels Arestrup), he begins performing regular assignments for him, proving himself invaluable to the imposing criminal. As Malik rises in the mob ranks, he gains more power, but also more enemies, a situation that eventually brings conflict with his mentor.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "2h 34m", "director": "Jacques Audiard", "studio": "CentreNationaldelaCin\u00e9matographie(CNC),France2(FR2),ConseilR\u00e9gionaldeProvence-AlpesC\u00f4ted&#39;Azur,ChicFilms,WhyNotProductions,NeonProductions,Page114,SoficaSoficin\u00e9ma4,CelluloidDreams,France2Cin\u00e9ma,Cin\u00e9Cin\u00e9ma,SoficaUGC1,Soficin\u00e9ma5,ZyzzyxLLC,Canal+,UnionG\u00e9n\u00e9raleCin\u00e9matographique(UGC),R\u00e9gionIle-de-France,BIMDistribuzione", "theater_date": "Feb 26, 2010", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$2.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The film's top dog, though, has to be Audiard, who directs with complete control, effortlessly fusing beady-eyed social realism, savage action and hallucinatory fantasy to create a searing crime movie masterpiece.", "One of the finest prison sagas in recent years.", "Jacques Audiard outdoes himself with a prison-based coming-of-age tale that is also a magic realism-charged ghost story.", "A Prophet's distinction is its refusal to play to convention.", "A film that is tense and crackling with fury, a visceral experience that threatens to leap from the screen.", "A taut, solidly crafted drama. Audiard's world is both fully realized and compelling, even if its consideration of Malik as some sort of modern day prophet seems halfhearted and ultimately beside the point.", "It wasn't a whole lot of fun at the time, but it was utterly compelling. It never felt less than real. And months later, it sits well.", "Usually, I don't much like films in which males throw violence at any problem that comes their way... But this is such an intensely mature piece of work featuring such intensely mature performances that I was too involved to let it bother me.", "Rahim more than rises to the challenge of making Malik utterly compelling throughout his journey. Mr. Arestrup manages to use his physical frailty to convey enormous threat in a way no English-speaking star of that generation would be willing to match.", "A Prophet is not a fabulous film, but it is well worth seeing. Although it is 2 hours 29 minutes long and its story is not surprising, it is always riveting.", "The director uses gritty in-your-face close-ups to immerse us in the daily routine of prison existence, which, like all minutely observed routines, is utterly compelling.", "Un proph\u00e8te, despite near-universal critical acclaim, languishes in an aesthetic no man's land.", "But with its lush Alexandre Desplat score, deeply shadowed compositions, and fluid, understated camera movement, A Prophet is distinctly an Audiard construction.", "", "This is a brutal prison crime drama that shows the transformation of a small-time criminal into a big-time crime boss.", "A movie that has more in common with Jean Genet than Frantz Fanon, but there's enough insights into white colonial domination of Arab peoples to make this a cut above the standard prison melodrama. Highly recommended.", "Like Goodfellas without the visual fizz, or Scarface played straight, this is, quite simply, one of the greatest prison films ever made.", "An epic-styled comment on the practical side of getting through modern life, with spirituality and loyalty playing side parts to gaining raw skill.", "... a riveting portrait of a prison education.", "...a journey of hard-fought survival told with an unforgettable verve and originality."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "", "", "3.5/5", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "", "5/5", "B", "", "5/5", "8/10", "", "9/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jason Best", "Richard Propes", "David Lamble", "Felicia Feaster", "David Harris", "Matthew Lucas", "Brian D.
