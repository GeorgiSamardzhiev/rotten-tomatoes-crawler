{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Larry Gopnik (Michael Stuhlbarg) is a physics professor at a 1960s university, but his life is coming apart at the seams. His wife (Sari Lennick) is leaving him, his jobless brother (Richard Kind) has moved in, and someone is trying to sabotage his chances for tenure. Larry seeks advice from three different rabbis, but whether anyone can help him overcome his many afflictions remains to be seen.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Joel Coen, Ethan Coen", "studio": "WorkingTitleFilms", "theater_date": "Oct 2, 2009", "dvd_date": "Mar 18, 2014", "box_office": "$9.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This has big \"we just won the Oscar, pay us\" energy, and leave it to the Coens to go even bleaker at their great moment of triumph.", "In possibly the funniest and yet most commandingly philosophical film in the Coen Brothers' distinct oeuvre, the mischief kicks off inside the head of a 13-year-old Jewish pothead.", "A Serious Man may be the hardest of sells for the Coens, but it is the most worthy too: painfully comic, rueful to its core, and capable of leaving Coen fans giddy with the sense that they have returned to form.", "Although it may be small in scale, from the cast of unknowns to the claustrophobic suburban locale, it's big in terms of script, performance and impact.", "The movie develops into a pretty good rabbi joke about the meaninglessness of the universe.", "By the time A Serious Man ends in a stunner of a conclusion, the Coen Brothers have once again pulled off a magic trick, forcing us to search for meaning in a series of scenes that possibly exist as abstractions only to obfuscate a lack of depth.", "Drawing upon the biblical Book of Job, A Serious Man is easily the most Jewish film that writer-directors Joel and Ethan Coen could make.", "This is a fantastic exploration on the power of religion and culture. The Coens working at their best capacity. [Full review in Spanish].", "The Coens' humor cuts deep, and A Serious Man is ultimately something quite beautiful.", "Does have its delicious moments and Michael Stuhlbarg does give an excellent, exasperated, frazzled lead performance... But without any warmth or expansiveness it all seems too cruelly easy and shrivelling somehow.", "... as funny, heartbreaking, questioning, trying, exasperating and sincerely inquisitive a portrait of the human condition as you'll find on screen.", "The entire script is a mishmash: funny, droll, and anxiety producing, just like daily life in many Jewish families.", "See this movie for a good laugh, and know that no matter what's going on in your life, A Serious Man proves things can certainly get worse.", "It's methodical, distancing and sarcastic, like all of their movies. And like all of them, it's exciting cinema, \"eminently watchable,\" as one of its characters would say.", "This might be the Coen Brothers' best film. I suspect they think so too. Even if you sense they can't quite grasp what they've stumbled across here, and surely don't want to.", "For all the droll wit on display, it's hard to warm to the Coens' chilly parable. Is Larry's suffering the work of God or the Devil, or just the random chaos of an indifferent universe? Arch-ironists to their fingertips, the Coens aren't telling.", "", "", "", "I guess gleeful misanthropy wasn't enough for the Coen Brothers.
