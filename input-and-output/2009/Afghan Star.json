{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Director Havana Marking dives into the booming, but still young and growing, world of pop culture in Afghanistan. Newly liberated after more than 30 years of stifling Taliban rule, the country is taken with a fervor for expression. This documentary follows four contestants, including two women, as they audition, sing and compete in a countrywide \"American Idol\"-type competition called \"Pop Idol.\" Marking uncovers a wonderfully vibrant community, which is also surprisingly accepting.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Art House & International/Documentary/Musical & Performing Arts/Special Interest/Television", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Havana Marking", "studio": "RoastBeefProductions", "theater_date": "Jun 26, 2009", "dvd_date": "Nov 18, 2016", "box_office": "$101.5K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's absolutely fascinating to see such a familiar talent show format - complete with sharp-tongued judges and starry-eyed wannabees - in such a vastly different setting.", "So much more than a reality show, it is a microcosm of the birth of a new democracy, of a free people facing the dawn of a new day.", "While its style and structure conform to the well-worn template established by docs like Spellbound, its success lies in creating an accessible, fun way into serious issues.", "Timely and intriguing docu was the winner of the Directing and Audience Awards at the Sundance Film Fest.", "For all the dramatic pull of the competition and insight into current culture and politics in Afghanistan, it's a bit of a shame that the film itself is such a dry affair.", "... more than a popular phenomenon, this documentary shows how a simple, completely apolitical piece of entertainment crosses ethnic, regional and cultural borders...", "For once, the McDonald's-like spreading of American culture abroad seems to have actually been a good thing.", "The film is both optimistic and depressing. This film is about a real war with real deaths that is going on in Afghanistan and one of the battlefields of that war is a pop music contest on television.", "Afghan Star is an engaging and important film and what it lacks in depth, it makes up for in cultural impact. Worth seeing.", "An inspiring, fun documentary.", "One of the more surreal docs to come down the pike in some time.", "Afghanistan's version of American Idol shines a spotlight on a culture in transition. Fascinating -- especially when it comes to the experiences of the woman who's risking her reputation and social standing in order to sing.", "It's an upbeat film, though hardly a convincing one, that shows there's more to the popular TV show than entertainment.", "The filmmaking itself is pretty much by the numbers...But there's some genuine tension as the competition field narrows.", "The film's essential fascination and integrity swamp any qualms about its pacing or all-around moviemaking.", "...by the end of the 88 minute journey you'll learn more about contemporary Afghanistan than you will from a month of watching television news in the United States.", "Of all the films to come out of the conflict, Afghan Star is the most provocative, because its message that people are essentially the same is a dubious, double-edge sword.", "Marking has a good eye for capturing the contradictions of Afghanistan.", "It's hard not to look at the effect this program is having on the country and not come away thinking military might isn't the solution a lot of those in power would like us to believe it is.", "Like The Kite Runner novel and movie, the documentary Afghan Star succeeds at dramatizing the lives of Afghans, but those we see on screen are real flesh-and-blood characters -- people who let their true feelings emerge."], "rating": ["4/5", "3/4", "", "B", "6/10", "", "", "8/10", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5", "4/5", "B-", "3/4", "3/4", "7/10", "3/4", "6/10", "3/4", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nikki Baughan", "Matthew Lucas", "David Fear", "Emanuel Levy", "Ian Buckwalter", "Sean Axmaker", "Rob Humanick", "Mark R.
