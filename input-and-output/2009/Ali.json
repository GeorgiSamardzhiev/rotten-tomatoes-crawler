{"metadata": {"synopsis": "With wit and athletic genius, with defiant rage and inner grace, Muhammad Ali forever changed the American landscape. Fighting all comers, Ali took on the law, conventions, the status quo and the war -- as well as the fists in front of him. Ali both ignited and mirrored the conflicts of his time and ours to become one of the most admired fighters in the world. Forget, now, what you thought you knew.", "rating": "68", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 38m", "director": "Michael Mann", "studio": "PictureEntertainmentCorporation,OverbrookEntertainment,ForwardPass,PetersEntertainment,ColumbiaPictures,InitialEntertainmentGroup", "theater_date": "Dec 25, 2001", "dvd_date": "Oct 16, 2012", "box_office": "$58.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It has the unsurpassable merit of its main character, Muhammad Ali, who is both one of the most serious people in the world and one of the funniest.", "Smith packed on the pounds, unleashed some great boxing moves, and displayed a level of emotional pull that compelled audiences to see him as The Greatest.", "[Michael Mann] successfully recreates an era on screen and provides a great introduction to the fighter that is not clouded by sentimentality.", "Will Smith takes the wise and sensible option of not trying to impersonate Ali per se, but rather tonally build an impression of Ali from his own natural register.", "A flawed film, then, and a comparative disappointment. But because of Smith, the scrupulous recreation of the period and the general quality of the performances, I'll score Ali a narrow victory on points.", "While making a great looking biopic that is filled with detail, Michal Mann forgot to make a film that entertains, creating an emotionally void, tone flat portrait of an athlete whose contribution socially and culturally has yet to be matched.", "You can almost see him thinking his way through his fights...", "Brutal fight scenes and frank racial issues.", "Mann vs. machine.", "More than competently mounted, with a hollowness just discernible in its core... feels like the first draft of whatever film Michael Mann set out to make.", "", "I respect it enormously, but it feels like an art film in search of a movie. Mann recognizes the importance of Ali as an entertainer, but he's in danger of forgetting how to be one himself.", "", "", "The challenge of dramatizing the celeb's life is only partially met nby Mann in this flawed biopic that narrowly focuses one one decade (1964-74), while gliding over Ali's private life and negletcing crucial aspects of his turbulent yet fascinating life.", "", "", "Smith, who has a well-developed ego of his own, not only looks like the young Ali but also sounds like the brash Louisville Lip.", "Smith's transformation is nothing less than astounding.", "No matter how good Smith and the other actors are, they seem at times dwarfed by the movie itself."], "rating": ["", "", "4/5", "3/5", "", "2.5/5", "", "5/5", "", "5/10", "3/5", "", "3/4", "4/5", "B-", "3/5", "3/5", "3.5/4", "3/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Brody", "Wilson Morales", "Kaleem Aftab", "PJ Nabarro", "Pat Stacey", "Matthew Pejkovic", "Sean Axmaker", "Nell Minow", "Rob Nelson", "Tim Brayton", "Leigh Johnson", "David Ansen", "Joe Lozito", "", "Emanuel Levy", "", "", "Judith Egerton", "Greg Maki", "James O&#39;Ehley"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">indieWire", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The List", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Herald (Ireland)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Matt&#39;s Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Turner Classic Movies Online", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">City Pages, Minneapolis/St. Paul", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Big Picture Big Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Courier-Journal (Louisville, KY)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Star-Democrat (Easton, MD)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Gurus"], "date": ["April 6, 2020", "March 31, 2020", "April 16, 2019", "December 8, 2018", "October 17, 2017", "January 4, 2012", "March 25, 2011", "December 21, 2010", "August 21, 2009", "June 26, 2009", "November 20, 2008", "March 31, 2008", "July 14, 2007", "December 30, 2006", "April 14, 2006", "December 6, 2005", "December 6, 2005", "June 25, 2004", "January 7, 2004", "May 16, 2003"]}}
