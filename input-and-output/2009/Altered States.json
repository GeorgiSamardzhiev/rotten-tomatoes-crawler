{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Respected scientist and psychology professor Edward Jessup (William Hurt) decides to combine his experiments in sensory deprivation tanks with powerful hallucinogenic drugs, convinced that it may help him unlock different states of consciousness. The experiments are a success at first, but as Jessup continues his work, he begins to experience altered mental and also physical states. As he spends more time in sensory deprivation, his grip on reality begins to slip away.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Drama/Horror/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Ken Russell", "studio": "WarnerBros.", "theater_date": "Dec 25, 1980", "dvd_date": "May 1, 2008", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Even 40 years after its release, it boggles the mind that something like Altered States could have ever been produced in the first place, much less as an expensive A-level project for a major studio.", "Exciting, powerful and frightening, this sci-fi action flick is a near-masterpeice.", "Ken Russell's movie can be quickly forgotten.
