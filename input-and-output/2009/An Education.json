Go straight to the head of the class with AN EDUCATION!!", "But it's [Carey] Mulligan who shines throughout, bringing a wide-eyed na\u00efve endearing charm to her character, her intelligence and pragmatism making Jenny far more than just a silly schoolgirl.", "Nick Hornby wrote the screenplay by inflating a fragment of Lynn Barber's memoir, failing to disguise the thinness of the material.", "Treats the issues it raises as black and white rather than really exploring them in a satisfying way.", "This is a charming coming-of-age film anchored by a star-making turn from lead Carey Mulligan.", "It's Lone Scherfig's subtle direction and Mr. Hornby's thoughtful script that make An Education such an interesting film, though.", "Scherfig manages this relationship superbly and it's this central lesson that makes An Education a film that will delight both the young and old.", "This is a nostalgically elegant, comically restrained, cleverly scripted film which, in parts, is also extremely moving.", "One of the chief pleasures of Lone Scherfig's crisply confident and charmingly comic coming-of-age drama is in seeing a teenage girl kick against the pricks for a change.", "An Education is so good, so intelligent that it invites little shocks of recognition or inspires debate.", "This is a lovely, delicious film with fine acting and a unique plot.", "What's good about Mulligan's performance is that it's subtle, and seemingly very natural. What's underwhelming about An Education is that all the drama that naturally occurs in a situation like Jenny's was missing.", "Carey Mulligan announces herself as a major name to watch.", "An Education deserves high marks. You could argue that the central relationship ought to seem sleazier, but Danish director Lone Scherfig perfectly captures the era's look and mood, Hornby's Oscar-nominated script is deft and the performances are spot on", "'An Education' is an knowing, affectionate portrait of a man who was surely the best and worst thing that ever happened to a girl who probably should have known better.", "", "", "Nick Hornby's screenplay is funny and sweet and 1000 percent English in that catnip-to-American-audiences way he's so good at already."], "rating": ["", "", "", "4/5", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "A-", "3.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "B", "3/4", "", "", "A-", "3/5", "3.5/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Felicia Feaster", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Nikki Baughan", "Troy Patterson", "Matthew Lucas", "Micheal Compton", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Kaleem Aftab", "Deborah Ross", "Kate Stables", "Dan DiNicola", "Ed Koch", "Candice Frederick", "Michael Dequina", "Jason Best", "Jason Bailey", "Nell Minow", "Hank Sartin", "Dave White"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Charleston City Paper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Roll Credits", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">From the Front Row", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The List", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sight and Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Daily Gazette (Schenectady, NY)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Atlantic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Talk Online", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieReport.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Talk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">DVDTalk.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Mom", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies.com"], "date": ["February 13, 2021", "January 23, 2020", "November 6, 2019", "October 29, 2019", "October 25, 2019", "August 5, 2019", "May 10, 2019", "December 1, 2018", "November 4, 2018", "August 30, 2018", "July 6, 2018", "February 5, 2018", "January 17, 2018", "September 11, 2017", "January 26, 2014", "August 2, 2012", "May 25, 2012", "February 14, 2012", "November 18, 2011", "April 4, 2011"]}}
