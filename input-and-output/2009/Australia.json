{"metadata": {"synopsis": "With the globe on the brink of World War II, Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) travels from Britain to Australia to inspect a cattle ranch she inherited. Reluctantly joining forces with a rugged local known as the Drover (Hugh Jackman), she sets out on a cattle drive across hundreds of miles of harsh terrain to save her ranch. But when they finally reach the town of Darwin, they must contend with the same Japanese bombers that just rained death upon Pearl Harbor.", "rating": "55", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Mystery & Suspense/Romance", "runtime": "2h 45m", "director": "Baz Luhrmann", "studio": "BazmarkFilms", "theater_date": "Nov 26, 2008", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$49.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Manages an epic feel and an extreme runtime, though the former is oftentimes merely a result of the latter.", "Australia, almost despite itself, isn't really an awful film.", "A beautifully rendered but flawed pastiche of the grand epics of old.", "Look, I realize this subject is a labor of love for Luhrmann, but the real pain comes from watching the final product -- not making it.", "What you do get... is a firm commitment to epic, triple-espresso-shot extreme romance (the kind spelled XTREEEM!) and the kind of tear-jerking that involves having both your arms wrenched behind your back until you holler \"Uncle!\"", "Australia, a heaping blend of romance, adventure and action, is for all those folks who ask, \"Why don't they make movies like they used to?", "Australia is as big, lumbering, vast, dry, and aimless as the catch-all title would lead you to believe.", "Unless you don't remember what it's like to be so young with a head full of daydreams, you'll be happy to be carried off into the gorgeous Australian sunset.", "Australia works well enough to recommend, but this will likely be the least-worshiped movie in Luhrmann's filmography.", "When [Luhrmann] goes from silly to turgid in 60 seconds flat -- he punctures Australia's proportions down from epic to simply overwrought.", "There's a lot that feels jarringly overdone here.", "Hard-hitting social commentary is not [Baz Luhrmann's] forte and while he strives for analogy and pertinence, all is lost in a dust cloud of galloping horses and magical realist swish.", "Australia offers an often engaging story with some amazing cinematic moments. But with less self-indulgence on Luhrmann's part, it could have achieved greatness.", "\"Australia\" is a shameless-and shamelessly entertaining-pastiche. It works because Luhrmann, a true believer in movie-movie magic, stamps it all with the force of his own extravagant, generous personality.", "Australia strains hard for epic Gone with the Wind territory, but it is undone by its own hubris, although, to be fair, the scenes of the Australian outback almost make the film worth seeing.
