{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this early Woody Allen comedy, the director stars as Fielding Mellish, a hapless product-testing New Yorker desperately attempting to impress a young and attractive social activist named Nancy (Louise Lasser). When Mellish travels to the turbulent country of San Marcos, he falls in with resistance fighters and, before long, becomes drafted as their leader. While Mellish's position of authority wins Nancy over, he has to deal with the many burdens of being a revolutionary leader.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Classics/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 22m", "director": "Woody Allen", "studio": "Rollins-JoffeProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 1, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Lighthearted, goofy, cynical, ridiculous, and scathingly critical in equal proportions.", "It is safe to say that Bananas was one of the funniest movies among his earlier films and there is a lot in it that would get a laugh or at least a chuckle out of you.", "Woody Allen is funny by reason of being Woody Allen, but that is becoming a decreasingly cashable asset.", "Much of the humour is blunted by Allen's self-indulgence as both a director and actor.", "Without verbal jokes, [Allen] can be a disaster.", "Currently Allen looks like the best American film clown around.", "Overall the film is most entertaining.", "When it comes for sheer, unadulterated fun, [Allen] never seemed more youthful or more exuberant than he did here.", "Rapid-fire gags and some inspired one-liners qualify this as an early classic from Allen.", "One of the early, funny films that a more mature Allen would dismiss later in his career, but nevertheless worth seeing again and again.", "Although some of the humor falls flat in this early Allen comedy, his satire of revolutions and revolutionaries is perpetually topical; subsequent events in Central America have only enhanced the film's appeal.", "It is a funny picture - not too consistently, and certainly not too coherently, but when it hits, it hits.", "A study of the Cuban Revolution by way of Freedonia", "Bananas is chockfull of sight gags, one-liners and swiftly executed unnecessary excursions into vulgarity whose humor for the most part can't make up for content.", "Inspired by the Marx Brothers comedies (specifically Duck Soup), Woody Allen made a leap forward as filmmaker in his second feature, a zany satire composed of riotous sketches and incoherent but funny one-liners.", "An attempt to capture the same zaniness the Marx Brothers had in Duck Soup.", "Wonderfully incoherent.", "Allen's view of the world is fraught with everything except pathos, and it's a view I happen to find very funny.", "", "I still love Woody's masked parents."], "rating": ["6/10", "", "", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "3/5", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "B", "B", "", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Alif Majeed", "Michael McNay", "Jan Dawson", "Dilys Powell", "Margaret Hinxman", "David A.
