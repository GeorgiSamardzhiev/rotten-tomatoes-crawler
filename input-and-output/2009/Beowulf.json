{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the age of heroes, a mighty warrior named Beowulf (Ray Winstone) arrives at the court of King Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins) and offers to rid the kingdom of a vicious demon called Grendel. He successfully slays the beast but thus incurs the wrath of Grendel's mother (Angelina Jolie), a creature as vicious and vengeful as she is seductive.", "rating": "71", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Animation/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "Robert Zemeckis", "studio": "ImageMovers,Shangri-LaEntertainment", "theater_date": "Nov 16, 2007", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$82.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The characters up on screen seem like living, breathing people.", "Expectedly, there are large-scale, edge-of-the seat clashes and some classic savage scenes. There are other interesting touches and some quirky emotions. It's a philosophical play on what it means to be a warrior.", "Avary and Gaiman lay on the sexual innuendo and adultery, fleshing out the character of Beowulf into a believably unreliable narrator.", "", "", "It's a superb action flick that will have you wide-eyed in awe at its effects; just don't go expecting any kind of literary discussion.", "Beowulf is a well conceived and technically excellent rendition of the ancient legend, but it doesn't follow its ideas through all the way, and some strange choices on the part of Zemeckis ultimately make it a little less than the sum of its parts.", "Beowulf is pretty to look at, but lacks soul. Perhaps it is time for Robert Zemeckis to return to the land of the living.", "The Old English poem ponderously, gracelessly expanded into an epic bore", "It drops its epic posture and spews far too many double entendres.", "700 A.D. is now 21st Century American 3-D. It's a hell of a transformation. The 3-D version of Beowulf -- the one you must see if you see the film -- is a wild roller coaster ride.", "...the initially impressive visuals are ultimately negated by the annoyance of the technology.", "A worthy cinematic adaptation, with interesting and provocative mythic ideas of its own, and suprisingly lyrical images to match. [Blu-Ray]", "The bane of English majors for 1,300 years makes it back to the big screen, now with 75 percent more hostility toward Christianity!", "The story contains plenty of action and great-looking graphics, but it hasn't much heart.", "Throw on your 3-D glasses and prepare to have your mind blown away.", "Robert Zemeckis' Beowulf is so rousingly entertaining that you'll feel guilty for not reading the epic poem all the way through when you were in ninth grade.", "So much is right about Beowulf that one longs for the darker, grimier version that might have been in live action.", "Robert Zemeckis' take on Beowulf is a marvel visually but eye-popping effects are still no challenge for good old-fashioned human emotion.", "At the end of it all, if you take away the violence, the defiantly in-your-face nudity, and Angelina Jolie, you will find very little story underneath."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "2/4", "4/5", "B", "4/5", "4/5", "6.5/10", "2.5/5", "", "2.5/4", "3.0/5", "3.5/4", "3/4", "4/5", "5/10", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Matthew Lucas", "Namrata Joshi", "Kaleem Aftab", "Nell Minow", "Ben Kenigsberg", "Alex Fletcher", "Joshua Starnes", "Matthew Pejkovic", "Fernando F.
