{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1818, high-spirited young Fanny Brawne (Abbie Cornish) finds herself increasingly intrigued by the handsome but aloof poet John Keats (Ben Whishaw), who lives next door to her family friends the Dilkes. After reading a book of his poetry, she finds herself even more drawn to the taciturn Keats. Although he agrees to teach her about poetry, Keats cannot act on his reciprocated feelings for Fanny, since as a struggling poet he has no money to support a wife.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "Jane Campion", "studio": "AustralianFilmFinanceCorporation,BBCFilms,HopscotchProductions,ScreenAustralia,JanChapmanPictures,Path\u00e9RennProductions,UKFilmCouncil,NewSouthWalesFilm&amp;TelevisionOffice", "theater_date": "Sep 16, 2009", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$4.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Jane Campion's \"Bright Star\" manages to accomplish quite a bit, not the least of which is a love story where the lovers not only rarely get any time alone together, but fall in love in front of the whole family.", "Bright Star is filled with such an enormity of love and feeling, it nearly takes your breath away. The film's rapturous images and Campion's vision make you long for a world as vivid and true as this one.", "The film succeeds in making the lustre of Keats' words come borne out of the inspiration he finds in his love for Fanny Brawn and the transcendent beauty of the natural world.", "The love story between John and Fanny fuels the narrative and draws in the viewer - we root for their happiness even though we know only heartbreak lies ahead.", "There are moments of great and sublime beauty at work here.", "Bright Star is a beautiful film, filled with the glories of nature and man that inspired Keats.", "The problem that the New Zealand director cannot overcome is that there is the lack of electricity between Ben Whishaw and Abbie Cornish in the lead roles.", "Yes, it is a thing of beauty and, yes, things of beauty are joys for ever but we can also probably say this about them: they don't always add up to the most affecting movies.", "The film is mistaken to the point of perversity about the nature of imagination when it comes to a poet and especially to this poet.", "In a world where only Hollywood cinematic romance is acceptable, it is a risk that pays off.", "Campion manages to understand and present the essence of a passionate relationship, without becoming corny or old fashioned. [Full review in Spanish]", "Bright Star is a work of muted eroticism, and in its bare-bones approach, it's a story reminding us that love often grows without explosive fanfare.", "Every frame exudes a sweet, doomed innocence that makes you want to cry, then swoon, then cry again.", "Wonderful attention is paid to detail, including clothing, furniture and highly-stylized behavior. What is missing is emotion.", "It all feels quite lovely and seems an achievement unto itself, to be allowed to soak in all this calm and tenderness.", "Director Jane Campion's most enthralling film since The Piano.", "I&#65279;f the theme of Bright Star is the realization of oneself in natural emotion, the method is gorgeously unnatural.", "[Jane Campion] shows us here the beautiful sanctuaries that word and image create together, and the reasons why life requires us ... to abandon them.", "Campion's film avoids any taint of costume drama frippery. Yes, Fanny starts off as a Regency-era fashionista, but Cornish and Whishaw's deeply felt performances give us a real sense of the beating hearts beneath the frock coats and bonnets.", "to film asxoleitai me ton erwta toys, apo th skopia ths Fanny, apo th skopia petaloydas poy sboyrizei anemela mexri na brei sto libadi poihth na toy royfhksei to nektar"], "rating": ["", "", "4/5", "4/5", "3.5/4", "3/4", "2/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Andrea Thompson", "Felicia Feaster", "PJ Nabarro", "Nikki Baughan", "Matthew Lucas", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Kaleem Aftab", "Deborah Ross", "Christopher Ricks", "Shelagh Rowan-Legg", "Laura Hiros", "Dan DiNicola", "Joe Reid", "Ed Koch", "Martha Polk", "Caryn James", "Stuart Klawans", "Nicola Evans", "Jason Best", "Joseph Proimakis"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">A Reel of One&#39;s Own", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Charleston City Paper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Roll Credits", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">From the Front Row", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The List", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New York Review of Books", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">That Shelf", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rinc\u00f3n de cine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Daily Gazette (Schenectady, NY)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Decider", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Atlantic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MUBI", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Marie Claire", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Nation", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Comment Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Talk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies for the Masses"], "date": ["October 8, 2020", "January 24, 2020", "October 31, 2019", "October 29, 2019", "August 5, 2019", "December 5, 2018", "November 4, 2018", "August 30, 2018", "August 29, 2018", "May 18, 2018", "March 16, 2018", "February 3, 2018", "January 24, 2018", "January 17, 2018", "December 14, 2017", "October 11, 2017", "June 13, 2016", "September 24, 2014", "August 2, 2012", "September 29, 2011"]}}
