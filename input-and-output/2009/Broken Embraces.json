{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The death of Ernesto Martel (Jos\u00e9 Luis G\u00f3mez) sets off a chain of events that forces one man to come to terms with his past. Before he went blind, Harry Caine was Mateo Blanco (Llu\u00eds Homar), a film director who often worked with Ernesto. Ten years ago, Ernesto and Mateo's friendship became a battle for Lena (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), Ernesto's mistress and Mateo's secret object of affection. When the former recruits his son (Rub\u00e9n Ochandiano) to spy on the latter, things quickly spiral out of control.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 8m", "director": "Pedro Almod\u00f3var", "studio": "ElDeseoS.A.", "theater_date": "Nov 20, 2009", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$5.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Broken Embraces shows Almod\u00f3var at his most self-indulgent and self-referential...

But somehow, instead of setting up house in our memory it departs quickly and lightly when it is done.", "Broken Embraces is certainly moody, and that's one of its charms. But behind the style is disappointing substance, a melodramatic story that's as old as Hollywood.", "Cruz delivers a role with wit and elegance, but there's a vacuum sapping the energy she tries to offer. So much for a film that tries too hard to be original.", "Since her star-making turn in Volver, Cruz has evolved into a great actress, whose films the audience longs to return to: she and Almod\u00f3var have created whole and complete worlds. Indeed, Broken Embraces mirrors our own - but brightly.", "... Broken Embraces is a well-written story of a love so precious it hurt.", "The entire third act is anticlimactic and forgettable, and one has to wonder why Mr. Almod\u00f3var has to let his penchant for melodrama ruin a well executed noir.", "Though the film offers nothing new for the eyes, its wordiness ultimately acts as a complement rather than a drawback to Almod\u00f3var's masterful storytelling.", "", "", "", "", "", "Almod\u00f3var and Cruz fail to engage this time around.", "Continues the director's streak of reliably elegant, original works, making the case, once again, that there are few other European directors working today who can match his particular blend of thought-provoking, artful, yet wholly accessible cinema.", "Um dos piores trabalhos de Almod\u00f3var, aqui totalmente entregue \u00e0 auto-indulg\u00eancia, ao melodrama barato e \u00e0s caricaturas (o que n\u00e3o \u00e9 novidade), mas sem a sensibilidade costumeira que normalmente contrabalan\u00e7a seus excessos.", "Pedro Almodovar reteams with Penelope Cruz, and you have your review right there."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "", "2.5/4", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "B+", "", "", "3/5", "3/5", "A-", "4.5/5", "3.5/4", "3/5", "8.1/10", "1/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jason Best", "Richard Propes", "Felicia Feaster", "Matthew Lucas", "Sarah Kerr", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Dan DiNicola", "Jeffrey Edalatpour", "Candice Frederick", "Martin Tsai", "Andrew Chan", "Hank Sartin", "Joshua Rothkopf", "Christine Champ", "Dave White", "Peter Travers", "Don Groves", "Ian Buckwalter", "Pablo Villa\u00e7a", "Josh Larsen"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Talk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Charleston City Paper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">From the Front Row", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New York Review of Books", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Daily Gazette (Schenectady, NY)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Rumpus", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Talk Online", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Critic&#39;s Notebook", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Comment Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rolling Stone", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">sbs.com.au", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">DCist", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema em Cena", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm"], "date": ["November 24, 2020", "September 4, 2020", "January 23, 2020", "August 5, 2019", "March 13, 2019", "November 22, 2018", "January 2, 2018", "September 18, 2017", "September 11, 2017", "October 7, 2015", "September 24, 2014", "November 18, 2011", "November 17, 2011", "May 6, 2011", "April 4, 2011", "February 3, 2011", "December 31, 2010", "July 4, 2010", "June 19, 2010", "May 10, 2010"]}}
