{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this drama based on a true story, there's no one tougher or more brutal in the English penal system than prisoner Michael Peterson, aka Charles Bronson (Tom Hardy). First incarcerated after robbing a jewelry store, the married Bronson is sentenced to seven years. But his incorrigible, savage behavior quickly gets him in trouble with guards, fellow inmates and even a dog. The only place where Bronson can't do any harm is in solitary confinement, where he spends most of his time.", "rating": "76", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Nicolas Winding Refn", "studio": "PerfumeFilms,Str8jacketCreations,VertigoFilms,AramidEntertainmentFund,EMMedia,4DHFilms", "theater_date": "Oct 9, 2009", "dvd_date": "Jan 7, 2017", "box_office": "$104.8K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Refn probably burns too much of the juice he could be using for character motivation or some perspective on crime and punishment on the style-for-style's-sake gangsta glam of Guy Ritchie.", "Whichever part you feel the most uncomfortable with, it's worth enduring it for \"Bronson\" is filled with imaginative and memorable imagery.", "It's actually quite an intuitive work, taking Bronson's publicity-courting profile as a base to conjure a lurid opera on the phenomenon of 'Bronson'.", "It's not a masterpiece by any stretch; but it's original and pacy, and those qualities are rare enough.", "Hardy does an admirable job of making this monster human, which he achieves with surprising wit and a visceral, attention-grabbing passion.", "...the film can barely contain Tom Hardy's performance. It's a Method turn so bloodily immersive it's hard to imagine the actor getting his head straight afterwards.", "The movie's giddy brio can leave you punch-drunk, and oddly unsatisfied.", "An overstylized mess, with a brave but pointless performance from Tom Hardy as a lifelong prisoner who just wants to destroy everything around him, most of all himself.", "", "...an anthropological study in human viciousness, like a nature film done by Stanley Kubrick.", "", "full review at Movies for the Masses", "", "Britain's Got Talent never looked so good.", "Bronson doesn't have much to say, but it's a very fun exercise in bad behavior that's neither glamorized nor bemoaned.", "It's content to be a kind of freak-show character study of a man who embraces anarchy, not for its own sake but for the fame and adrenaline that it brings him.", "This is psychotic behavior as performance art, and Hardy makes it irresistible.", "For such a potentially exciting subject matter, Bronson hits way too many lulls.", "In the end, \"Bronson\" is a beautiful, intense film about a man that may or may not be insane, based on events that might actually have occurred in his life.", "Director and co-writer Nicolas Winding Refn strives mightily to match his star crescendo for crescendo, which can be exhausting.
