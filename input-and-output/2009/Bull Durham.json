{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In Durham, N.C., the Bulls minor league baseball team has one asset no other can claim: a poetry-loving groupie named Annie Savoy (Susan Sarandon). As the team's season begins, Annie selects brash new recruit Ebby Calvin Laloosh (Tim Robbins), whom she christens \"Nuke,\" to inspire with the religion of baseball. Nuke also receives guidance from veteran player Crash Davis (Kevin Costner), who settles Nuke's erratic pitching and teaches him to follow the catcher's lead.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Ron Shelton", "studio": "TheMountCompany", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 20, 2015", "box_office": "$49.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Writer/Director Ron Shelton clearly knows what he's doing here.", "Down-to-earth personalities and the honest, simple, funny dialogue are spot-on.", "You 'd never find similar scenes to \"Bull Durham\" in, say, Europe, and not because they don't have our national pastime; they're just too sensible. You simply have to love America to be able to revel in our delightful, deep state of cultural silliness.", "Bull Durham puts Shelton in the Hollywood big leagues, and he's hit his very first pitch over the scoreboard in centerfield.", "Bull Durham (1988) is a humorous and intelligent romantic sports comedy-drama about a mediocre Carolina minor leagues baseball team - the Durham Bulls, from first-time director Ron Shelton. It is the quintessential modern sports film about America's...", "Bull Durham is the greatest baseball film ever made. It captures the essence of the game. It's full of crackling dialogue that is endlessly quotable. It's absolutely hilarious at times and heartbreaking at others.", "Is Bull Durham the greatest sports movie ever made? No argument from me.", "Writer-director Ron Shelton tells a wonderful story of how a veteran ballplayer and up-and-comer collide in the world of the minor leagues, and how they are loved by a baseball groupie who's also a philosopher and poet.", "Does an impressive job picking up the mundane world of bush league baseball in spirit.", "It's not just the screenplay, it's the performances and direction that make this film.", "Costner is charming as an aging catcher who decides it's time to hang up his mitt at Sarandon's place.", "Bull Durham is the feel-good movie of the Summer of '88.

So what are you waiting for?", "A smart, witty character piece that eschews the stale sports flick formul", "Screwball Annie and hardball Crash aren't playing the same game, which is Shelton's conceit as well as a possible screen-writing miscalculation.", "Ron Shelton, who wrote and directed the film, displays a knowledge of and affection for the national pastime. You can see it in the knowing detail he brings to even the minor characters.", "Bull Durham is a jaunty, refreshing comedy that mixes sex The ambling pace and inventiveness of Bull Durham are the doing of Shelton, a filmmaker worth watching. This film is a tidy summing-up of one aspect of America`s favorite sport.", "[Crash's] remit? To teach talented but undisciplined pitcher Ebby (Tim Robbins) about hurling a ball. And a little about life.", "[Shelton is] uncanny at putting us inside his players' heads when they're on the mound or up at bat, running their private litanies of encouragement and subversion to psych themselves up.", "Rather than a vapid national epic, it is a warm, droll, deftly cracked romantic comedy.", "The acting in Bull Durham cannot be faulted and should be remembered at Oscar time.
