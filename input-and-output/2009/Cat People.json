{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Irena Dubrovna (Simone Simon), a New York City--based fashion designer who hails from Serbia, begins a romance with marine engineer Oliver Reed (Kent Smith). After the couple gets married, Oliver becomes concerned about Irena's notion that she is cursed and may transform into a large cat in the heat of passion. Confiding in his beautiful assistant, Alice Moore (Jane Randolph), about his marital issues, Oliver unwittingly triggers Irena's curse, with tragic results.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Drama/Horror/Romance", "runtime": "1h 13m", "director": "Jacques Tourneur", "studio": "RKORadioPicturesInc.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 17, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Perhaps this fantastic tale could have been arranged to achieve the eerie credibility of Dracula, but Simone Simon seems by nature to be more kitten than were wolf.", "A weird little chiller called Cat People... is calculated to frighten you out of your wits and make you think twice before trusting anyone who arouses a feline's instinctive dislike.", "Simone makes her way through his combination of phantasy and reality, and comes off creditably in a part that calls for emotional repression.", "Photography and settings are effective, and the naturalness of the dialog issuing from such a murk of the fantastic is very impressive.", "The film, which has been admirably mounted and tightly directed and acted, should find an appreciative audience among those who prefer melodrama with originality, but can scarcely be termed pleasant entertainment.", "The legend has been staged effectively for the most part, by virtue of Nicholas Musuraca's photography, exercised amid first-rate settings, and Jacques Tourneur's direction. When the film is dealing with the supernatural, it is quite spooky and absorbing.", "Cat People is a story that will hold you through to the picture's end. A flapping blind may be your undoing for several days to come, however.", "This RKO production is a great example of Hollywood's waste of precious lime and valuable material.", "Cat People, per all advance heraldings, is supposed to be some punkins as a thriller. But for my money, whatever that may amount to, it isn't a breeze let alone a shiver.", "Cat People benefits rather substantially from its justifiably iconic visuals and a smattering of admittedly captivating sequences...", "Although slow-moving and depressing, Cat People is an interesting program horror melodrama.", "Odd is the word for this film.", "It will give you icy jitters, but it's kinda fun at that.", "A degree of suspense has been attained, which certainly is better than par for this type of production.", "[Cat People] takes a long time to become horrifying. When it does, it is terrific.", "Cat People demonstrates that a monster in the shadows is frightening, but the reasons that monster is there in the first place are even more so.", "Cat People is rife with subversive subtexts, alarming suggestions, and potent performances. Cinema rarely manages something so creepy and bizarre as Tourneur and Lewton's strangely poignant and unforgettable film.", "Val Lewton proves that it doesn't take much money to create a short bit of sufficiently thrilling, creative, and classically scary entertainment.", "Cat People is a psychological horror film, so don't come expecting to see a woman transform to a CGI cat before your eyes.", "To think of this film as a comfort movie is about as strange as it is to call this odd little B-picture a horror movie, because it's not, really. It's so much more."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "1/4", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "4.5/5", "7/10", "8/10", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Moira Wallace", "Mildred Martin", "Len G.
