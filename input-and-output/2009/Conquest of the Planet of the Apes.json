{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this third sequel to \"Planet of the Apes,\" the apes turn the tables on the human Earth population when they lead a revolt against their cruel masters in the distant year of 1990. By doing this it creates the time loop that leads to the first film. \"Conquest of the Planet of the Apes\" is cinematically etched in broad, brash strokes slashing social satire and science fiction suspense with large-scale spectacle.", "rating": "50", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 26m", "director": "J.

Lee Thompson's direction furiously propels the action in a compact chromium-and-glass setting -- and wait till you see that last battle royal.", "", "The Conquest of the Planet of the Apes is the fourth in this series of movies that began with Planet of the Apes and it also is the least of them.", "The best of the series. Apes in modern day (well, modern for then). Like all great sci-fi, has moral implications.", "Surprisingly entertaining.", "The message is that passing power from one to another does not change the essential nature of power. Rather, power contaminates the person (or ape) who wields it.", "", "Proof that mediocre sequels are hardly a new sensantion.", "This bleak chapter of the Apes saga strived to echo the sentiments of many of its fellow films released that year.
