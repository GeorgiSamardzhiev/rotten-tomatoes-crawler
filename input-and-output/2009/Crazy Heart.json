{"metadata": {"synopsis": "With too many years of hazy days and boozy nights,former country-music legend Bad Blake (Jeff Bridges) is reduced to playing dives and bowling alleys. In town for his latest gig, Blake meets Jean Craddock (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a sympathetic reporter who has come to do a story on him. He unexpectedly warms to her and a romance begins, then the singer finds himself at a crossroads that may threaten his last shot at happiness.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts/Romance", "runtime": "1h 52m", "director": "Scott Cooper", "studio": "InformantMedia,Butcher&#39;sRunFilms", "theater_date": "Feb 5, 2010", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$39.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Crazy Heart is too sentimental and predictable to be a classic, but the songs are impressively authentic and Bridges delivers a superb performance.", "One of the best films of 2009.", "What keeps this indie drama just the right side of average is a brilliantly measured, Oscar-winning performance by the great Jeff Bridges.", "Crazy Heart has the mellow, believable gait of real life, and sometimes the truth is better than any reassuring fiction.", "Do yourself a favor. Just go crazy this weekend. Go crazy for CRAZY HEART.", "Truly, the entire cast is tremendous-with the glaring exception of Farrell, who is woefully miscast. But Bridges carries the film on his capable shoulders, appearing in every scene, many times alone.", "The earnest charm, the moments of clarity and regret, and the amazing talent he imbues Blake with make us long for the singer's redemption. Sadly, his path of deliverance is not nearly as engaging or authentic as the man himself.", "This is a story that's been told a thousand times, sometimes with Kris Kristofferson in it, and sometimes not, and it just doesn't bring anything new to the party.", "Crazy Heart is a wonderful picture that will immediately affect you and hold your interest to the very end.", "With great performances from Bridges and Gyllenhaal, Crazy Heart is a winner and a must-see.", "Basically a live-action version of the cliche country-western song with a man down on his luck and losing everything in his life, it comes close to being a joke about itself.", "", "Bridges' worn down country singer is as well realized as any character he's ever done. It may take a while to get going, and to develop, and to wrap up, but there's enough meat to make Crazy Heart worthwhile, even if it is made to last a while.", "Played by a gracefully aging Jeff Bridges, Bad is an older, greasier and groggier version of The Dude", "Cooper is so afraid of being bold and baring some soul, he achieves little more than the anachronistic, cookie-cutter blues that his lead character spent a lifetime trying to avoid.", "A picture so carefully narrowed feels like an adaptation to current trends and tends to distort life somewhat.", "Barry Markowitz's camerawork at times captures the hazy heat of the American southwest, giving it a sepia-toned warmth, while this grainy wash gives Blake's late-night bender scenes a green-about-the-gills feel.", "Formidable acting talent aside, this is routine self-destruction-and-recovery TV movie material.", "Don't expect greatness from the man named Bad", "Jeff Bridges finally won his Oscar for Crazy Heart and it was well-earned indeed."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "3/5", "", "", "7/10", "", "", "", "5.0/5", "2.5/5", "3/5", "8/10", "", "2.5/5", "", "3.5/5", "2/4", "2/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jason Best", "Richard Propes", "Leigh Paatsch", "Felicia Feaster", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Debbie Baldwin", "Megan Basham", "Deborah Ross", "Ed Koch", "John Hanlon", "Kevin Carr", "Joshua Rothkopf", "Joshua Starnes", "Matt Kelemen", "Simon Miraudo", "David Walsh", "Cris Kennedy", "Michael Dequina", "Marty Mapes", "Sean Axmaker"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Talk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Charleston City Paper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Ladue News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WORLD", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Atlantic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Big Hollywood", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">7M Pictures", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ComingSoon.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Las Vegas CityLife", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Quickflix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screenwize", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieReport.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Habit", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seanax.com"], "date": ["November 29, 2020", "September 5, 2020", "May 4, 2020", "January 23, 2020", "November 6, 2019", "November 13, 2018", "October 4, 2018", "August 30, 2018", "January 16, 2018", "October 30, 2012", "July 22, 2012", "November 17, 2011", "March 18, 2011", "January 31, 2011", "October 21, 2010", "July 6, 2010", "July 4, 2010", "May 16, 2010", "May 2, 2010", "April 26, 2010"]}}
