{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When the only daughter of a Boston homicide detective, Thomas Craven (Mel Gibson), is shot on his doorstep, everyone assumes that he was the intended target.

They're that satisfyingly heightened version of reality no one actually gets to experience.", "Adapted from the landmark BBC mini-series by original director Martin Campbell, Edge of Darkness is a polished piece of political suspense masquerading as a crime drama and pulling off both rather successfully.", "The attempt at grittiness comes off soft.", "Monahan mistakes rambling exposition for captivating back-and-forth and Campbell doesn't help any by making the film as drab and turgidly paced as possible.", "Martin Campbell returns to the once edgy and jagged ground of his excellent BBC miniseries Edge of Darkness with a much slicker spin that sheds much of what made the first go around so good.", "Sadly the movie is a ponderous, unnuanced, run-of-the-cyclotron thriller."], "rating": ["8/10", "", "2.0/4", "2/5", "3/5", "2/5", "2.5/4", "B-", "", "D", "3/5", "3.5/4", "4/5", "", "3/5", "8/10", "2.5/5", "2/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Jason Best", "Richard Propes", "Leigh Paatsch", "Nikki Baughan", "David Harris", "Matthew Lucas", "Micheal Compton", "Ed Koch", "Candice Frederick", "Brigit Grant", "Sean P.
