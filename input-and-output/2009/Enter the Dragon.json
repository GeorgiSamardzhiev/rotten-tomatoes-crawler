It's a film I could rewatch perhaps every other week.", "The fact that Lee has to share screentime with two other battlers continues to minimize his impressiveness - especially when it comes to Saxon, who is quite unconvincing.", "Although it features all the period trappings of misogynist tendencies evidenced in the film's closest cousins, the rampant exploitation films of the 1970s, the formidable kung-fu sequences are the greatest feature.", "What action!", "Iconic and record shattering in every way, there's no doubt that Enter The Dragon is the film most Bruce Lee fans immediately associate with him and which largely introduced him as a superstar and cultural icon in the western world.", "At this point in the game is there really anything to say about \"Enter the Dragon\" that hasn't already been said? It's the greatest, most influential martial arts movie of all time.", "As for Lee... I can't begin to describe what he did.", "In 1974, one left \"Enter the Dragon\" going, \"What'd I just hear? What'd I just see?\" I'd watch 8 straight hours of all Bruce's movies, analyzing and re-analyzing, in hopes of gaining insight into this amazing new world of transcendental butt-kickery.", "Even the great-granddaddy of martial arts flicks suffers from the drawbacks of the genre, turning into a mindless orgy of kicks and chops.", "A whoop-and-holler entertainment, which is to say that it's a lavish, corny action movie, not boring for a second and as outrageously wry as it is visually appealing.", "Director Robert Clouse works the material for efficiency and optimum thrill, while providing a buoyant visual style to the action.", "A pop-masterpiece, and one of the finest pieces of pure action cinema ever made.", "As in even the very best Kung Fu movies, mayhem ensues, especially once hundreds of fighting champions storm the island in an out-of-control melee that Lee walks through with complete cold discipline.", "A pretty excellent action film that gives [Star] Lee the chance to play the dashing hero...", "Enter the Dragon is the first classy Kung Fu movie specially designed for Western audiences, and that's not to be confused with first-class.", "[VIDEO ESSAY] From a historical perspective of cultural influence, Bruce Lee's last movie is a martial arts film of epic proportions.", "The acting is wooden and the sound effects are even worse (especially in terms of voice dubbing). But the fight scenes are excellent especially in reference to Bruce Lee.", "The only real disappointment about Enter the Dragon is that it is Bruce Lee's last movie.", "The chop-socky film to beat them all.", "If kung fu is now the standard badass language, Enter the Dragon -- featuring Lee's great slow-burn stare -- is the first grammar lesson."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "7/10", "", "3.5/4", "", "A", "", "4/5", "3.5/5", "", "3/4", "1", "8/10", "", "", "A-", "3/5", "", "", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tom Meek", "Mike Massie", "Nicholas Bell", "Matt Brunson", "Ed Travis", "Brent McKnight", "Dick Lochte", "Mark Jackson", "Christopher Lloyd", "Alan R.
