{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Lying on her deathbed, drifting in and out of consciousness, Ann Grant Lord (Vanessa Redgrave) calls forth memories of her one true love, Harris Arden (Patrick Wilson). As a young woman, she met Harris at her best friend's wedding and had a brief affair, but it ended when he left her to marry another. As Ann recalls the bittersweet time in her life, her daughters (Toni Collette, Natasha Richardson) try to come to terms with her imminent death.", "rating": "27", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 57m", "director": "Lajos Koltai", "studio": "HartSharpProductions", "theater_date": "Jun 29, 2007", "dvd_date": "Oct 1, 2014", "box_office": "$12.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "", "", "Given its stellar cast -- including Vanessa Redgrave, Meryl Streep and Glenn Close -- and source material, it's hard not to think it should be better.", "Antiseptic bourgeois swank", "What's the difference between slasher films and chick flicks? In slasher films they suffer less, and they die quicker. Evening, bless its banal heart, is a chick flick in all its fatuous glory.", "Frankly I could watch Danes, Collette, Streep, Close, Richardson, etc., as they go food shopping, which just goes to show what a bunch of great actors can do for a fairly conventional tear-jerker.", "Strong cast is best part of tragic romantic drama.", "The performances are oddly muted, as if the screenplay refuses to allow a fine cast full rein. But those who loved the book can be assured that it has been translated faithfully enough to the screen.", "An old lady takes a long time to die in this po-faced literary effort as a bed-ridden Redgrave looks back to the golden summer when her young self (Danes) found love.", "Some big names have been assembled for this old-fashioned \"woman's picture\" about thwarted expectations and lifelong regrets.", "I am against the exploitation of women for sentimental screen purposes (Steel Magnolias, Crimes of the Heart). But what can you do? Here they moon and croon across a time divide.", "An affected and overwrought adaptation of Susan Minot's novel about a dying woman's memories of a complicated romantic incident in her youth.", "Evening is a film about regrets that doesn't say an awful lot, but somehow holds your attention with the scenes between Redgrave and Streep sure to bring a tear to your eye - or at least your mum's.", "Dull. It's hard to engage with the characters, the themes are underdeveloped and the tone is flat as the waters lapping the Wittenborn beach.", "Adapting from Susan Minot's bestseller, Hungarian director Lajos Koltai's (Fateless) pulls together a formidable cast - Meryl Streep, Glenn Close, Toni Collette - but then leaves them to wade through a sickly stew.", "Evening is a slow burner, so slow in fact the credits roll before it ever gets going.", "It's a very odd film that can discuss heart-blackening guilt, loveless marriage, pain and regret only to taper off into a dry-eyed ending.", "The film disintegrates into an indulgent succession of intense, fawning exchanges that overwhelm Minot's thin and monotonous tale.", "Recycling ideas and characters from 250 years of romantic literature without adding any new ones of its own, Evening is like dining with Jane Austen and Barbara Cartland and not being allowed to get down from the table."], "rating": ["2/5", "C+", "4/10", "2/4", "", "1.5/5", "3/5", "3/5", "2/5", "2/5", "2/5", "", "2/5", "", "2/5", "2/5", "2/5", "2/5", "2/6", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Hank Sartin", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Heather Huntington", "Mike Scott", "Fernando F.
