Also the meanest.", "In effect, the Coens have written an action film that disregards the basic principle of the genre: that character is expressed in action.", "Not only did the Coens return from the brink, but they gave us one of the most memorable (if not the most memorable) characters in modern cinema.", "Two words. Marge Gunderson.", "The film is a work of brick-by-brick world-building in the service of characters whose ordinariness is just as carefully crafted.", "Deceptive in its storytelling choices, economical with its plotting, and sly with its dialogue, this Oscar winner is truly incredible.", "Fargo, with its grotesque murders and cheery detectives, is a cold gem that takes us to the far north. Its seemingly pitiless light opens up the realms of darkness concealed beneath that world of white.", "A small, supremely satisfying film. Heck and you betcha, it is.", "A few scenes go around in circles, as if snow-blind, and the humor may be too inward and contorted for some tastes. But McDormand brings order to the weirdness and warms it up.", "It's another daring black comedy by one of the most consistently inventive moviemaking teams of the last decade, brothers Joel and Ethan Coen.", "Returning to the horror-comic vein that launched their careers, director Joel Coen and producer Ethan Coen pepper their new picture with so much humor that the occasional bursts of sheer mayhem seem more ridiculous than revolting.", "You have to grant the Coens their due as creators of suspense, mood and plotting, and for their ability to color the most monstrous crimes with an undeniably funny sense of the absurd.", "From the camera angles to the set design, everything is calculated to make the viewer feel superior to the cloddish, geeky characters on display."], "rating": ["1", "3.5/4", "", "5/5", "", "", "", "4/4", "", "", "5/5", "", "A", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "", "4/4", "", "3.5/4", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "Tim Brayton", "David Baron", "Derek Malcolm", "David Hunter", "Chris Hewitt", "Adam Mars-Jones", "Jason Bailey", "Kate Muir", "Chris Packham", "Glenn Dunks", "Michael Wilmington", "Steven Rea", "Anthony Lane", "Gene Siskel", "David Sterritt", "Gary Thompson", "Dave Kehr"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternate Ending", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times-Picayune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">St. Paul Pioneer Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flavorwire", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Village Voice", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Quickflix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News"], "date": ["September 11, 2020", "September 7, 2020", "August 5, 2020", "May 19, 2020", "May 30, 2019", "March 20, 2018", "March 19, 2018", "March 5, 2018", "November 15, 2017", "April 9, 2016", "March 10, 2016", "January 19, 2016", "April 29, 2014", "April 21, 2014", "April 21, 2014", "April 21, 2014", "April 21, 2014", "April 21, 2014", "April 21, 2014", "April 21, 2014"]}}
