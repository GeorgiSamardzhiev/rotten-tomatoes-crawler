{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Imprisoned on a drug charge, mobster Jack DiNorscio (Vin Diesel) refuses to testify against his former associates in the Lucchesi crime family.

And, in director Sidney Lumet, Find Me Guilty, has a master storyteller spinning the yarn.", "An entertaining, true-life, comedy-drama saga of a nearly endless mob trial.", "It's hard to do anything in court that hasn't been done before. It's a static situation, and points are scored in tiny increments. No big witness-stand breakdowns, no tearful confessions.
