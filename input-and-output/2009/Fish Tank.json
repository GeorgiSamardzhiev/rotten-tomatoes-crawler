{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Mia (Katie Jarvis) is a rebellious teenager on the verge of being kicked out of school. Her hard-partying mother, Joanne (Kierston Wareing), neglects Mia's welfare in favor of her own, and her younger sister (Rebecca Griffiths) hangs out with a much older crowd. Sparks fly between Mia and Connor (Michael Fassbender), Joanne's new boyfriend, and he encourages Mia to pursue her interest in dance. As the boundaries of the relationships become blurred, Mia and Joanne compete for Connor's affection.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "2h 4m", "director": "Andrea Arnold", "studio": "BBCFilms,UKFilmCouncil", "theater_date": "Jan 15, 2010", "dvd_date": "Feb 17, 2017", "box_office": "$373.1K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Agritty, gripping drama that boasts a terrific performance by newcomer Katie Jarvis.", "If you come for Fassbender, you'll stay for Jarvis. A nonprofessional actor who got the role after being scouted during an argument with her then-boyfriend, she's extraordinary...", "Always vibrantly alive, teeming with energy and a raw, compelling power.", "Jarvis brings an abrasive brilliance to the role of Mia...", "Arnold nails the gnarled world of Mia: by product of a neglectful mother, and a landscape awash in booze and deprived of the educational and fiscal means of social betterment.", "It's not wholly convincing and its view of tower-block dwellers may well be patronising, but it is utterly absorbing and has such impact that you seriously have to gather yourself afterwards.", "Arnold's script and camera close in and tear apart ideas of the poor, youth, and what makes a good man.", "... a film whose originality and reflection of reality, as well as absolute rawness will leave you with a bittersweet taste in your mouth. [Full review in Spanish]", "[Andrea] Arnold has a knack for subtle details but also for portraying female characters whose natural warmth and energy have been muted by trauma or social isolation.", "Fish Tank is a very strong effort at every level, and should signal great things to come for all involved. Bloody good movie.", "The film becomes a caricature of arthouse miserabilism, which asserts that the only truths are the ugly ones.", "The film is remarkable for its depth. It's not drilling in a message about the hopelessness of poverty, nor is it stylising the lifestyle of those living on council estates.", "Reveals the incidental arrival of the first trickles of emerging maturity.", "Plenty of films have presented us with the Angry Young Man but not so many with the Angry Young Woman ...Andrea Arnold does her bit to help correct this imbalance with Fish Tank...", "Stark, powerful drama for older teens and adults.", "Mia is not treated like an overly clever ingnue (as in An Education) or as a pious, almost impossibly well-adjusted soul (as in Precious) or worse, as Bella Swan.", "( ... ) Fish Tank feels more fluid, more passionate than other recent English films about the wretched working classes.", "Fish Tank may begin as a patch of lower-class chaos, but it turns into a commanding, emotionally satisfying movie, comparable to such youth-in-trouble classics as The 400 Blows.", "The film's rough patches are ... considerably smoothed over by its performers.", "A bold new entry in the long-standing British tradition of disquieting social realism."], "rating": ["", "", "3/4", "", "3/5", "", "", "3/5", "", "8", "C-", "4/5", "8/10", "7/10", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "B", "9.7/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jason Best", "Charlotte Harrison", "Matthew Lucas", "Brian D.
