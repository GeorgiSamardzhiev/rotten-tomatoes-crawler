{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the slums of Campania, the Camorra crime syndicate has created a fortune out of cocaine, corruption and chemical waste. Some try to fight back, like teens Ciro (Ciro Petrone) and Marco (Marco Macor), who decide to steal a Camorra weapons cache in a bid to take control themselves. Others try to hide, like Pasquale (Salvatore Cantalupo), a tailor trying to get around paying protection fees. But the realization sets in: The Camorra is too large, too deeply embedded in Italy to be fought.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 17m", "director": "Matteo Garrone", "studio": "Fandango,RaiCinema", "theater_date": "Feb 13, 2009", "dvd_date": "Feb 17, 2017", "box_office": "$1.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There are interesting sociological features here, but like most gangster films, Gomorrah gets much more caught up in the scenes of violence than is healthy.", "The violence in Gomorrah is shocking, but there's none of the exhilaration you find in films like Scarface or Goodfellas or City of God. Instead, what you get is a terrible, gut-clenching sense of clammy dread.", "An intensive and exhausting study of organised crime, Gomorrah holds back on the glamour and goes full-bore with the graft.", "The violence here is all the more unnerving arriving as it does, as pro boxers say, like the punch you didn't see coming. Its style falls between the verite school of documentary and a revitalized Italian Neorealism.", "This is a bleak look at a putrid culture and the way its black tentacles extend throughout Italy.", "Craft-wise it's solid, but beyond in-house intrigue there's not an awful lot going on beneath the surface.", "The documentary aesthetic, multi-layered storytelling and nihilism ensures that the action is satisfyingly disorientating.", "There is nothing grand or operatic about Gomorrah and, as a result, it is poundingly powerful. It is heartless yet gripping, off-hand yet peculiarly intimate, and courageous in the way it presents itself.", "Highly conscious of how it portrays the mafia, Garone's film serves as a useful antidote for those of us who watch and love movies that transform murderers into mythic figures.", "A cruel, ruthless portrait and per the serious threats received by the author of the homonymous book ... true. [Full review in Spanish]", "It's been a while since I first saw this brutal slice of social realism in Cannes. And it left an indelible impression, if not an urgent desire to see it again.", "... Matteo Garrone's Gomorrah grabs you with a strong sense of visual expressiveness and never ceases to let go...", "The Camorra grinds up the lives it touches, including those who take the gangsters as their role models for success.", "\"Gomorrah\" soberly shows the low-life thugs for what they really are, resisting the convention of casting them as anti-heroes in Scorsese or Tarantino land.", "The camera's performance, like that of the actors, keeps growing in scale and expressivity, even as life gets worse and worse.", "This might be one of those movies that are more fun to praise than they actually are to watch.", "Matteo Garrone doesn't so much reinvent the gangster genre as much as he reimagines it, taking all the usual trimmings and turning them inside out.", "A thrillingly bleak crime pic.", "It is a full and frank indictment of a system that has not just failed but utterly decayed and is breeding more and more criminals.", "Thug-life fantasies here provide lures into ruthlessly complex realities and rigmaroles - slamming characters' faces into the rug before it's pulled from beneath them. The notion that anybody could be a don dies in a blaze of energy, rage and ambition."], "rating": ["", "", "4/5", "", "", "3/4", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "", "B-", "A-", "", "4/5", "4/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Jason Best", "Leigh Paatsch", "David Lamble", "David Harris", "Matthew Lucas", "Kaleem Aftab", "Deborah Ross", "John Powers", "Laura Hiros", "Brian D.
