{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Retired auto worker and Korean War vet Walt Kowalski (Clint Eastwood) fills emptiness in his life with beer and home repair, despising the many Asian, Latino and black families in his neighborhood. Walt becomes a reluctant hero when he stands up to the gangbangers who tried to force an Asian teen to steal Walt's treasured car. An unlikely friendship develops between Walt and the teen, as he learns he has more in common with his neighbors than he thought.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 57m", "director": "Clint Eastwood", "studio": "MalpasoCompany", "theater_date": "Jan 9, 2009", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2010", "box_office": "$148.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The originality of the film is minute, while the story offers few surprises.", "The film is clunky in places... but it is also warm, funny and moving, and genuinely thought-provoking about no end of hot-button contemporary issues, from race and class, to ageing and masculinity.", "A rewarding, entertaining film.", "As a film, Gran Torino is powerful, moving and entertaining; as a tribute to a living legend, it's deeply, indelibly affecting.", "It takes the showdown trope so prevalent in his treasured Westerns and turns it on its head.", "An elegy for a country looking for atonement after losing its way in macho xenophobia.", "It is rumored this could be the 78-year-old's final film performance. If that is the case, Eastwood goes out on top - creating one of his most memorable characters in his rather impressive acting resume.", "[The] twist... elevates Gran Torino far above the typical vengeance-wreaking flick.", "It is a flawed movie, vastly overwritten, with characters pointing things out that we've long worked out for ourselves. Still, the self-referentiality of Eastwood's performance ensures that Gran Torino isn't just absorbing, but also moving.", "...\"Gran Torino\" contains within its strangely tight wanderings the utter, dexterous precision of drama-comedy and tragedy-given not to intellect and consideration, but to profound conviction and feeling.", "Seeing Eastwood ward off young gangsters was odd... well, but he pulled it off enough.", "Aside from the somewhat dubious pleasure of Eastwood's tuneful noodlings, Gran Torino is not a very good film.", "[Its] problems cannot be ignored.", "This is another Eastwood's deconstruction of his career, and it doesn't give anything else in the movie any room to breathe.", "", "", "Covers a lot of ground as it rolls: religion, the toll of war, mortality, what it means to be a man.", "Twenty minutes in, we know Walt is eventually going to give the car to the kid.
