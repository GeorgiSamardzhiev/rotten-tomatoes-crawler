It's also totally bereft of innovation... [Blu-ray]", "Not a classic, but cute and fun for families.", "Freed from the tyranny of dimensionality and realism, the animators indulged in one of the most goofy, silly, cartoony projects made at Disney in years.", "The Disney animation horse has officially bolted.", "Assorted movie in-jokes should keep parents tolerably entertained, and Alan Menken's songs mercifully favor western swing over the expected twang pop.", "At last the humble cow has been recognised for more than simply gracing Gary Larsen cartoons.", "The film is garish and frenetic but absolutely lifeless.", "...only very small children will be able to label it anything more than a pleasant diversion.", "Adults will enjoy saddling up and going for the ride -- possibly even enjoying this moo-vie more than your kids.
