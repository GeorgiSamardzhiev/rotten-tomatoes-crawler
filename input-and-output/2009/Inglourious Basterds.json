{"metadata": {"synopsis": "It is the first year of Germany's occupation of France. Allied officer Lt. Aldo Raine (Brad Pitt) assembles a team of Jewish soldiers to commit violent acts of retribution against the Nazis, including the taking of their scalps. He and his men join forces with Bridget von Hammersmark, a German actress and undercover agent, to bring down the leaders of the Third Reich. Their fates converge with theater owner Shosanna Dreyfus, who seeks to avenge the Nazis' execution of her family.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "2h 32m", "director": "Quentin Tarantino", "studio": "ABandApart,ZehnteBabelsberg", "theater_date": "Aug 21, 2009", "dvd_date": "Dec 10, 2015", "box_office": "$120.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It wasn't satisfying... Perhaps I'll change my mind. Perhaps I won't. But today I'll simply say that I thought it was inglorious indeed.", "Fans will find plenty to love with the ample servings of clever dialogue, a spattering of brutal violence, and a revenge story built for a truly explosive conclusion.", "Fortunately, in Waltz Tarantino has found an actor who carries off the script's multi-lingual wordiness with panache, while investing his character with a combination of suave menace and knowing humour.", "Waltz gives the film's most satisfying performance.", "Quentin Tarantino's unconscionably entertaining Nazi-kitsch gore fest thrusts him back into the cultural conversation...", "Inglorious Basterds is glorious!!!!! The film is so enjoyable, so entertaining, so smartly written, so well crafted, so beautifully lensed and so well acted that I didn't want it to end.", "Inglourious Basterds is bold, brazen and satisfying in the extreme.", "It's very, very entertaining. It's also, of course, pretty violent, and the kind of inventive, colorful violence his fans have come to know and love.", "...Inglourious Basterds is Tarantino's best film.", "Tarantino's Western-inspired fantasy acts as a real-world corrective of how the Nazis perhaps ought to be seen - with utmost scorn - and in what context this sort of cinematic violence can, and even should, be indulgent.", "It's clever, riotously amusing in parts, and does have some salient points to make about the relativity of the acceptance of violence.", "You have to respect Tarantino's vision, moral aversions or not. But the result this time feels like a great idea that ranged out of hand.", "When Tarantino sent this message to moviegoers in 2009, it's unlikely that he imagined how relevant it would be in 2019.", "A highly ambitious and highly entertaining effort that takes the war drama and crushes it to pieces -- reassembling a masterpiece that reinvents the familiar genre.", "However, despite the aspects that can make loving Tarantino a slog, he has moments of true cinematic greatness that cannot be ignored.", "It's all eye-poppingly impressive, and the relentlessness of it will still make you want it to stop as you head deep into hour three. Then after you leave, you might find you think about it a lot, how interesting it was, even the boring parts.", "It's funny. It's violent. It's funny and violent. The acting is unbelievable. Pitt is charming as the icy killer, and it's clear Tarantino has found his new muse in Laurent.", "From the opening moments (Tarantino's films always start strong), the film establishes itself as the auteur's best work.", "The performance of Christoph Waltz, playing the Nazi Gestapo figure Col. Hans Landa, is the highlight of the film. His ability to convey courtliness and sympathy and then go to commit the cruelest of horrors is simply superb.", "Where Death Proof kept halving itself-effectively remaking and one-upping the Kill Bill mommy saga with different drapery-Basterds keeps excoriating everything, loud and proud and begging to be heard."], "rating": ["", "8/10", "", "3.0/4", "", "5/5", "5/5", "4.5/5", "5/5", "", "3/5", "2.5/4", "4/4", "A", "4/4", "", "9/10", "4/4", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jennifer K.
