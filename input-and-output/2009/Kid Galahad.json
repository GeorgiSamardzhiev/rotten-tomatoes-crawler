Willy hopes that Walter will earn enough money fighting in the ring to help him pay off his many gambling debts. Walter, on the other hand, hopes that he can earn the attention of Willy's little sister Rose (Joan Blackman).", "rating": "40", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Phil Karlson", "studio": "MirischCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 6, 2005", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Elvis wanted to spread his wings, and he clearly had the chops.
