It's so bad that, even at 87 minutes, it's probably a good 87 minutes too long.", "Written by Stewart Williams and Paul Hupfield with an insatiable urge to suck.", "The one dimensional narrative struggles to hit home.", "The DVD release of Vampire Killers leaves out the 'Lesbians' from the title. Also missing are funny jokes, thrills and engaging characters.", "the only thing that made it watchable was its mercifully short length", "", "Sure, the whole thing sets gay rights and feminism back 40 years, but Lesbian Vampire Killers doesn't mean to offend. It is, in fact, all rather tongue-in-cheek, very much in the tradition of Sean of the Dead or Lair of the White Worm.", "It may not be smart, but under the right circumstances, it sure can be fun.", "For others just looking for schlocky kicks, this might have a finger-clicking pace and high-gloss finish, but it's no more than a calling card from director Phil Claydon and the script, written by a pair of comedy-sketch writers, is surprisingly dull.", "It's a 15-year-old boy's idea of a great night at the movies -- sexy ladies in lingerie who get their heads lopped off.", "The misogyny is too insistent to be ironic, despite the relatively small use of nudity and gore. The vampires, when slain, spurt milky white fluid rather than blood, a peculiarly unpleasant, and telling, detail.", "The relentlessly puerile, juvenile humour of Lesbian Vampire Killers makes it something of a guilty pleasure, but a pleasure none the less.", "The humour is deadbeat British, which jangles fearsomely with the vampire theme. The tone is brashly entertaining, as the filmmakers borrow shamelessly from 50s horror conventions", "", "Let's get one thing straight. It's not drivel because of its lesbian titillation. It's just drivel. The Beavis and Butthead mentality is just another reason to loathe it, like Page Three of The Sun.", "", "Agreeably goofy but surprisingly mild horror-comedy...that's several guffaws short of a laff riot.", "Grab your holy water and your wooden stakes, you'll have a good time.", "The entire project is a crushingly lazy attempt to create a piece of titillating, exploitative horror-comedy that manages to achieve none of its aims.
