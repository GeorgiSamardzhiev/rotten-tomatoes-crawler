Initially reserved with each other, Oskar and Eli slowly form a close bond, but it soon becomes apparent that she is no ordinary young girl. Eventually, Eli shares her dark, macabre secret with Oskar, revealing her connection to a string of bloody local murders.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Horror", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "Tomas Alfredson", "studio": "Canal+,SandrewMetronome", "theater_date": "Oct 24, 2008", "dvd_date": "Jan 14, 2017", "box_office": "$2.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["My favorite Swedish import.", "Production values are pretty good: everything looks believably \"eighties\", the snowscapes of Sweden look mighty fine and everything is underscored by a suitably moody soundtrack.", "Beautifully made and exquisitely realised by all involved, this is a remarkable movie that redefines horror film-making and deserves to reach as wide an audience as possible.", "This is not your typical blood-and-guts horror film...the heart of Let the Right One In is the friendship between Oskar and Eli. Despite Eli's vampirism, this relationship feels realistic.", "A beautiful, enchanting gothic fable that is at once strangely charming and unabashedly macabre.", "A tale of how damaged people forge connections, how they learn to survive and, ultimately, where they find genuine love.", "At Oskar's age, every girl, vampire or not, knew something we didn't. And it was terrifying. Somehow, Let the Right One In pulls this off without copping out on creating a genuinely scary horror movie.", "I'm not exaggerating when I say that it's probably the best vampire movie in the last 75 years... Let the Right One In takes its sting from the fact that the one you let in your door may, in the long run, not be so right after all.", "Who better to sympathize with during the lonely alienation common to adolescence than the equally forlorn existence of a teenage vampire?", "Every drop of blood is well-earned, and often well deserved.", "Let the Right One In will please horror fans who revel in the gritty, messy aspects of vampire love inside a solid screenplay.", "Let the Right One In, perhaps more subtly than its predecessors in the sub-genre, perfectly captures the nature of love as a delicate and dangerous balancing act.", "A strange, stunning and surprisingly sweet Swedish film about childhood friendship and first love.", "A smart and beautifully realized feature from Sweden.", "Alfredson's light touch adds soulful delicacy and a certain ambiguity to the proceedings, making this a horror movie more likely to prompt tears than screams.", "Sinister but gorgeous and compelling.", "A remarkably moving horror tale, about a pale, bullied twelve-year-old boy (K\u00e5re Hedebrant) and his first love (Lina Leandersson), who happens to be a vampire.", "Pre-adolescent angst has rarely been as eerie or unsettlingly honest as it is in director Tomas Alfredson's stylish, psychologically complex tale,", "Let the Right One In eschews all the crap that has plagued vampire films for years. This is a dark, serious and twisted film.", "One of the best foreign language films of the year"], "rating": ["", "", "5/5", "3.5/5", "3.5/4", "5/5", "", "", "", "", "B-", "", "5/5", "3.5/5", "4/5", "", "", "3/4", "4/5", "A-"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Annalee Schafranek", "Ard Vijn", "Nikki Baughan", "David Harris", "Matthew Lucas", "C.H.
