{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Mark Rutland (Sean Connery) is a customer of one Mr. Strutt, whose business was robbed by his secretary, the mysterious Marnie Edgar (Tippi Hedren). When Marnie applies for a job with Mark, with the intention of stealing from him, Mark -- who is obsessively in love with her -- blackmails her into marrying him. However, he soon discovers that she has severe psychological issues regarding men, thunderstorms and the color red, and resolves to help her come to terms with her past trauma.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Classics/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 9m", "director": "Alfred Hitchcock", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 8, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Marnie is Alfred Hitchcock's forty-ninth film. It might be the most perfectly tooled yet.", "It is a film of such complexity that, after three viewings, I feel that I have hardly begun to understand it, but each time, new layers of meaning have revealed themselves.", "Hitchcock's elegant cinematic style, evident here and there, seems wasted in a melange of banal dialogue, obtrusively phony process shots, and a plot that congeals more often than it thickens.", "Calmer reflection has established this as one of Hitchcock's more fascinating \"misfires.\"", "Marnie is Hitchcock's darkest work. The director's vicious trip through the mind of a disturbed woman offers little in the way of respite, but captures the attention through intrigue, and the sheer filmmaking abilities of the master of suspense.", "I think the main thematical implication of Hitchock's [Marnie] is exactly that. The constant confusing morality of leaving the viewers take control as he himself hasn't got it under his spell.", "Strange, richly told tale, full of echoes of Hitchcock themes.", "Psychologically resonant, visually transcendent ...", "Hitchcock was criticised for bring shallow psychology into the film (Hedren's character is afraid of the colour red) but some of their exchanges - the film was based on a novel by Winston Graham - are sharp and droll.", "A farsighted yet unassuming thriller with brilliant desires to deconstruct a human mind.", "professionally crafted film that focuses primarily on character development", "Unfortunately, Marnie was released right after the masterpiece The Birds and comparisons were inevitable, but there's so much to admire about this work, textually, dramatically, visually.", "A worthwhile watch for anyone who's ever enjoyed Hitchcock, but by comparison with his better known stuff it's an example style overtaking substance.", "This remains a compelling Hitchcock thriller but it's Tippi Hedron's remarkable central performance which steals the show.", "A masterpiece of psychological mystery that encompasses all of the director's obsessions.", "Universally despised on its first release, Marnie remains one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest and darkest achievements.", "Marnie's Mama's house is a masterpiece of repressed emotion, a bland domestic space of seemingly placid creams and yellow, rendered in swirling wallpaper and upholstery patterns.", "...a crazed and lurid character portrait that spends most of its time psychoanalyzing itself.", "Marnie is the character study of a thief and a liar, but what makes her tick remains clouded even after a climax reckoned to be shocking but somewhat missing its point.", "A savory failure from the Master."], "rating": ["", "", "", "4/5", "", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "4/4", "B", "B+", "", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "2/4", "", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Henry Geldzahler", "Ian Cameron", "TIME Staff", "David Parkinson", "Richard James Havis", "Shikhar Verma", "Michael E.
