{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Queen of France at 16 and widowed at 18, Mary Stuart defies pressure to remarry. Instead, she returns to her native Scotland to reclaim her rightful throne. But Scotland and England fall under the rule of the compelling Elizabeth I. Each young Queen beholds her sister in fear and fascination. Rivals in power and in love, and female regents in a masculine world, the two must decide how to play the game of marriage versus independence.", "rating": "62", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 4m", "director": "Josie Rourke", "studio": "FocusFeatures,WorkingTitleFilms,PerfectWorldPictures", "theater_date": "Dec 21, 2018", "dvd_date": "Feb 19, 2019", "box_office": "$16.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's too bad the narrative machinations bog down what otherwise is a fine tale of political manoeuvring.", "[Saoirse Ronan's] presence on screen is illuminating; you can't help but root for her ruthlessness and anger at the injustice of her downfall.", "Mary Queen of Scots is a courageous true story that shines a light on our darkest abilities, all the while showing us a small sliver of hope in the end, just enough to make us feel the blunt of its intent.", "[Director Josie Rourle] arrives with an incredibly emotive debut using material many already feel all too familiar with, granting these annals of history a glorious immediacy which few have ever been able to conjure.", "As many people have pointed out, this film is certainly not historically accurate so if you're the kind of person who needs that you'd leave feeling disappointed.", "It is a handsome, yet frivolous, period drama told through a sharp modern gaze that greatly benefits from a number of strong performances from across its very talented cast.", "It's melodramatic and unashamedly fictionalised, but it's also a joy to watch.", "The final result is a mishmash of introspective themes that the picture fails to juggle, and . . . Rourke's direction doesn't liven much up.", "It's downright tragic. And this makes it ripe for these two great performers to dig into and make great, even if the material isn't always.", "Director Rourke makes entertaining something that could've been tedious. [Full review in Spanish]", "it's telling that one of the most compelling characters in the film is Mary's gay husband, Henry, played in a refreshingly honest manner by Jack Lowden...he is often more interesting than the two queens.", "It's a shame that everything collapses when the queens finally meet in a sequence that has all the heft of a gauzy Chanel fragrance spot.", "...grabs for relevance come across as a desperate plea. The blatantness of it undermines the more subtle tones of a visually sweeping film, with strong performances. There are many jewels in this crown, the crown itself just needs a bit of extra polish.", "Mary Queen of Scots is about an OG Queen making all the folks in the United Kingdom put respect on her name.", "Mary, Mary, quite contrary, what does your movie show? Historical inaccuracies, an overstuffed story and a director not in the know.", "A traditional and essentially conservative biopic that your mum might like if The Favourite is too weird.", "Unfortunately, too much time is spent on luridness which gives this historical drama a feeling more akin to the naughty Showtime series The Tudors.", "I wish I could summon an ounce of enthusiasm for this film: it seems like a lot of effort was put into realising this 400-something year old tale. It is just too bad that it feels every bit its age.", "The costumes are utterly sumptuous and the period details are convincing, but to really see and understand the emotions governing those who govern others is what makes this film so remarkable.", "Despite the elaborate trappings of this period piece, particularly the costumes, hair and makeup, the flow of the film goes back and forth between these two rival queens vying for power like a slow, boring chess game."], "rating": ["2.5/5", "", "", "3.5/5", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "2.5/5", "2.5/4", "", "C", "", "", "8/10", "1.5/5", "3/5", "", "2/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Candice McMillan", "Dan Buffa", "Nicholas Bell", "Lucy Buglass", "Andrew Gaudion", "Tom Beasley", "Matt Cipolla", "Steven Prokopy", "Ricardo Gallegos", "Frank J.
