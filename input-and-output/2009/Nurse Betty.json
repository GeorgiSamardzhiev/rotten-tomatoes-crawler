{"metadata": {"synopsis": "What happens when a person decides that life is merely a state of mind? If you're Betty, a small-town waitress and soap opera fan from Fair Oaks, Kansas, you refuse to believe that you can't be with the love of your life just because he doesn't really exist. After all, life is no excuse for not living. Traumatized by a savage event, Betty enters into a fugue state that allows -- even encourages -- her to keep functioning... in a kind of alternate reality.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Neil LaBute", "studio": "ab&#39;-straktpictures,PropagandaFilms,IMF,PacificaFilm,AbstraktFilm,GramercyPictures", "theater_date": "Sep 8, 2000", "dvd_date": "Jan 26, 2016", "box_office": "$25.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Swerving from viciousness to whimsy to dubious feminist fable, Nurse Betty doesn't jell. Still, with a cast as charmed as this, it comes oh so close.", "This comedy has a few violent scenes.", "Good performances all around, especially from Zellweger and Kinnear. Lots of good laughs laced with nastiness.", "This is easily Ms. Zellweger's finest work.", "The actors hold the movie together, particularly Ms. Zellweger and Mr. Freeman, whose characters achieve a remarkable intimacy in a most unlikely situation.", "After a summer of cookie-cutter comedies and blowsy action flicks, Neil LaBute's Nurse Betty is good for what ails you.", "In his third, most accomplished film, LaBute puts aside the inquiry of misogyny that dominated his previous work and immerses himself in a lighter romantic fable about the collision of fantasy and reality, with a terrific performance from Renee Zelwegger", "Almost every emotion and action on view is presented as false, idiotic or superficial.", "Despite cringing at many of Betty's deluded interactions with the residents of her final destination and the director's seeming lack of faith in the believability of many of the scenes, Nurse Betty still turns out to be entertaining.", "If I had to use just one word to describe Nurse Betty, that word would undoubtedly be...Quirky. And I mean that in a really, really good way.", "In the end [it] tells us we shouldn't depend on each other... we should be glad that 'we have ourselves.' What a lonely and sad conclusion.", "Nurse Betty suffers, however, from a script that relies on jaded hit men for comic impact. We've seen it done too many times since...Pulp Fiction.", "Las actuaciones son buenas, al nivel del gran elenco que se rene, pero el guin es el que se lleva los aplausos.", "One of the finest-written surprises of the year.", "A strong contender for one of the best films of the year.", "This bizarrely funny satire/allegory from the maker of heavier fare such as In the Company of Men works on a surprising number of levels, not the least of which is perhaps the first human Renee Zellweger performance I have ever seen.", "", "", "With Nurse Betty, Zellweger moves fully into the realm of leading lady. Her crooked mouth and mousey voice notwithstanding, I wouldn't think it would be out of the question for her to garner an Oscar nomination for this excellent performance...", "While Nurse Betty proves that LaBute has more than one string to his bow, you can't help thinking that he makes more memorable cinema when revelling in misanthropy."], "rating": ["", "4/5", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "A", "B+", "", "3.5/5", "3/4", "B-", "3/4", "4/5", "3/4", "3.5/4", "A-", "4/4", "3/4", "4.5/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Ansen", "Nell Minow", "Bob Grimm", "Joe Lozito", "Andrew Sarris", "Frank Swietek", "Emanuel Levy", "Geoff Andrew", "Ron Wells", "Scott Nash", "Jeffrey Overstreet", "Judith Egerton", "Alex Ramirez", "Gerry Gallo", "Jeffrey M.
