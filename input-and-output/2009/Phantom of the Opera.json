{"metadata": {"synopsis": "From his hideout beneath a 19th century Paris opera house, the brooding Phantom (Gerard Butler) schemes to get closer to vocalist Christine Daae (Emmy Rossum). The Phantom, wearing a mask to hide a congenital disfigurement, strong-arms management into giving the budding starlet key roles, but Christine instead falls for arts benefactor Raoul (Patrick Wilson). Terrified at the notion of her absence, the Phantom enacts a plan to keep Christine by his side, while Raoul tries to foil the scheme.", "rating": "33", "genre": "Drama/Horror/Musical & Performing Arts/Special Interest/Romance", "runtime": "2h 21m", "director": "Joel Schumacher", "studio": "JoelSchumacherProductions", "theater_date": "Jan 21, 2005", "dvd_date": "Dec 27, 2011", "box_office": "$51.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["As I was sitting in the auditorium alone watching this film, I kept looking around hoping there was a chandelier above me getting ready to plummet to the ground.", "Rossum is a stunning beauty and very effective, but the movie's biggest problem is Butler.
