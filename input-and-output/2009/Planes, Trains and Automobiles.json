{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Easily excitable Neal Page (Steve Martin) is somewhat of a control freak. Trying to get home to Chicago to spend Thanksgiving with his wife (Laila Robins) and kids, his flight is rerouted to a distant city in Kansas because of a freak snowstorm, and his sanity begins to fray. Worse yet, he is forced to bunk up with talkative Del Griffith (John Candy), whom he finds extremely annoying. Together they must overcome the insanity of holiday travel to reach their intended destination.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "John Hughes", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "Nov 27, 1987", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$48.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A hilarious comedy from the 80s that holds up", "It is honestly one of the finest comedy performances of 1980s cinema.", "The movie falls into the trap of wimpy and bland sentimentality.

But Candy offers even more insinuating delights.", "Producer-director-writer Hughes infuses his film with an appealing sense of sentiment and humanity -- not to mention many hilarious scenes.", "Man versus technology has been one of the staples of screen comedy since the earliest silent days, and Hughes makes the most of the format here packing as many of the frustrations of modern life as he can into this calamitous travelog of roadside America."], "rating": ["", "8/10", "", "", "", "B", "8/10", "4/5", "4/4", "9/10", "8/10", "5/5", "6/10", "3.5/5", "4/5", "", "4.5/5", "", "3/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Rachel Wagner", "Grant Watson", "\u00c1ngel Luis Inurria", "Duane Byrge", "Danielle Solzman", "Dennis Schwartz", "Argun Ulgen", "Marc Lee", "David Nusair", "R.L.
