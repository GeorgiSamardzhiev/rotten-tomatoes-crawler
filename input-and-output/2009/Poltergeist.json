{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Strange and creepy happenings beset an average California family, the Freelings -- Steve (Craig T. Nelson), Diane (JoBeth Williams), teenaged Dana (Dominique Dunne), eight-year-old Robbie (Oliver Robins), and five-year-old Carol Ann (Heather O'Rourke) -- when ghosts commune with them through the television set. Initially friendly and playful, the spirits turn unexpectedly menacing, and, when Carol Ann goes missing, Steve and Diane turn to a parapsychologist and eventually an exorcist for help.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Horror", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "Tobe Hooper", "studio": "MetroGoldwynMayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 1, 2009", "box_office": "$121.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One of the most fun haunted house movies ever made.", "One of the all-time great haunted-house epics.", "Poltergeist doesn't deserve serious attention... It lacks minimal logic and a coherent objective. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The sweet, angelic face of Heather O'Rourke swirled together with viscous, ectoplasmic demons and food abominations make for an uncomfortable yet unforgettable movie watching experience", "A slick, entertaining ghost story and a stomach-turning gore-fest in equal measure, the balance of Spielberg and Hooper's creative impulses blending together.", "[It] raises interesting psychological issues in the context of a baroque ghost story. It's a devastating commentary on the tv-oriented suburban lifestyle. Finally, it demonstrates the power and efficacy of the story told from the child's point of view.", "Spielberg's intent may be satirical, but I find these stereotypes even more depressing than hobgoblins, and would not have minded if they'd all been dragged off into the fourth dimension.", "One of the 1980s' most distinctive and important horror movies.", "The buildup is slow and deliberate, creating a vivid sense of love and warmth within the family who share the harrowing adventure.", "Hooper's direction may lack its usual edgy personality -- apparently over-ruled by Spielberg's script suggestions -- but he puts on a dazzling show, and the intuitive performances are uniformly on the panic button.", "Hooper and Spielberg have worked long and hard to bring the ghost story to its fullest potential. They have succeeded.", "\"Poltergeist\" is a lot more dedicated to its cause than most viewers today are probably used to. It builds to something of value. That may not make it the most profound film of its genre by any stretch, but it does make it one of the most memorable.", "Spielberg, here credited as producer as co-writer, shows the other (darker) side of suburbia in this horror film, made in the same year as the superior E.T.", "Thanks to Poltergeist, more than a few of us still sleep with the lights on: the world has changed, but our closets haven't.", "A frightening, supernatural horror film that defined a generation.", "The film delivers honest special-effects shocks without forfeiting its good nature.", "One of the all-time great haunted house movies.", "...a compelling and consistently creepy piece of work...", "Spielberg clockwork: great suburbs, great special effects, great abuse of an expositive score, great overuse of the slow push-in, great hot mom, great irrelevant dad, great plucky little kids.", "Think of it more as a fun-ride than a horror movie."], "rating": ["B+", "9/10", "", "1", "", "", "", "7/10", "", "4/5", "", "3.5/4", "B-", "A-", "3.5/4", "", "5/5", "3/4", "3/4", "7/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Chris Stuckmann", "Mike Massie", "Diego Gal\u00e1n", "Tracy Allen", "Sean Fennessey", "Bruce McCabe", "Robert Hatch", "Tim Brayton", "David Sterritt", "Alan Jones", "Ralph Novak", "David Keyes", "Emanuel Levy", "Rob Vaux", "Wesley Lovell", "", "M.
