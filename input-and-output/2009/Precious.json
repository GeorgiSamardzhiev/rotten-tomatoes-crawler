But none had a more extreme transformation than Mo'Nique for Precious.", "For its portrait of a complex young woman caught in horrific circumstances, Lee Daniels' story - embellished by some incredible performances - is truly exceptional.", "Those moments are what push Precious in the TV movie of the week direction. But when Daniels steps back and lets the story and the performances speak for themselves, this is powerful stuff.", "When director Lee Daniels keeps his focus on that mother-daughter relationship, the film really soars. Unfortunately, Daniels adds a lot of busy work and secondary characters that for the most part don't bring anything to the film.", "A brutally believable story that could be happening to any girl right now, with an unknown actress who blows right off the screen and makes you feel everything she is.", "Precious is a hard but worthy journey.", "Unexpected and moving, Precious is a gem from the projects.", "This is either a good film with quite a few flaws, or a flawed film which is also quite good, but that's all right. None of us is perfect, after all.", "The performances of Sidibe and Mo'Nique are extraordinary and spellbinding.", "... Precious is a true story of survival and hope and not to be missed.", "If you are going to bring a victim of this magnitude to the screen, give her history the treatment it deserves, ie good direction or at the very least some proper editing to serve as an emotional sat-nav.", "It's amazing how the film turns out to be infinitely moving in spite of Mr. Daniels's stylistic self-destruct.", "Its flaws are more so of the executional than the conceptual kind, the whole more than the sum of its parts.", "The bottom line is that you've never seen anything quite like this -- in its highs, its lows, its gaffes, its embarrassments or its uplift.", "It's a deeply heart-busting story about finding self-realization.", "The remarkable Sidibe is one of several daring casting choices by director Lee Daniels."], "rating": ["1", "", "4.0/4", "3.5/5", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "A", "2/5", "", "B-", "4/5", "", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Jason Best", "Richard Propes", "Leigh Paatsch", "Jenna Marotta", "Felicia Feaster", "Matthew Lucas", "Micheal Compton", "Amie Simon", "Tara Thorne", "Kaleem Aftab", "Deborah Ross", "Ed Koch", "Candice Frederick", "Brigit Grant", "Martin Tsai", "Rob Humanick", "Ben Kenigsberg", "Patty Jones", "Rafer Guzman"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Talk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">indieWire", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Charleston City Paper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Three Imaginary Girls", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Coast (Halifax, Nova Scotia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The List", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Atlantic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Talk Online", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Express (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Critic&#39;s Notebook", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Projection Booth", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out Chicago", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Georgia Straight", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsday"], "date": ["November 29, 2020", "November 27, 2020", "September 20, 2020", "July 22, 2020", "March 31, 2020", "January 23, 2020", "June 6, 2019", "May 11, 2019", "March 9, 2019", "November 17, 2018", "November 4, 2018", "August 30, 2018", "January 17, 2018", "September 12, 2017", "August 23, 2017", "October 7, 2015", "February 3, 2013", "April 3, 2012", "April 4, 2011", "April 4, 2011"]}}
