{"metadata": {"synopsis": "On a magical night when they are in in their 20s, Jonathan (John Cusack) meets Sara (Kate Beckinsale). He finds it love at first sight, but Sara believes in destiny. After 10 years the two -- with 3,000 miles between them -- must decide if fate wants them to be together again. When love feels like magic, it is called destiny; when destiny has a sense of humor, it is serendipity.", "rating": "58", "genre": "Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Peter Chelsom", "studio": "TapestryFilms,SimonFieldsProductions", "theater_date": "Oct 5, 2001", "dvd_date": "Dec 20, 2015", "box_office": "$50.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...a somewhat absurd premise that's employed to pervasively affable and flat-out delightful effect...", "Despite its coincidental excesses, Serendipity is sweet fare, reminding us of the beauty and magic of life and love and of being in love in New York.", "Director Peter Chelsom's follow-up to the disastrous Town and Country is occasionally sickly sweet, but is saved from being just another dollop of seasonal pudding by Cusack's winning performance.", "Is it destiny that binds the leads together or the pesky script?
