{"metadata": {"synopsis": "John Shaft Jr. may be an FBI cyber security expert, but to uncover the truth behind his best friend's untimely death, he needs an education that only his dad can provide. Absent throughout his childhood, the legendary John Shaft agrees to help his son navigate the heroin-infested underbelly of Harlem, N.Y. Besides, the locked and loaded Shaft has his own score to settle -- both professional and personal.", "rating": "33", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Tim Story", "studio": "KhalaboInkSociety,NewLineCinema,DavisEntertainment,WarnerBros.Pictures", "theater_date": "Jun 14, 2019", "dvd_date": "Sep 10, 2019", "box_office": "$21.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["To dissect this film too deeply would give toxic masculinity and blatant homophobia their time in the sun.", "It's easy enough to laugh at the brazenness and the raunchiness.", "A frequently funny film that self-parodies without ever becoming a total joke.", "Some legends should be retired and admired for what they used to be. Shaft is one of them.", "Shaft is definitely everything we were hoping Jackson's first go-around in the role would be.", "At any rate, this oddball little film [is] just too much fun to do anything but groove with it.", "An appealing reboot.", "Whatever Shaft is saying about race, authority, age, gender or masculinity - which are interesting talking points no matter how badly fumbled they are - I keep going back to the rancid humour.", "There's not much else to this routine and sometimes retrograde actioner. Jackson deserves better material, but even so it's impressive how far he can carry it.", "Shaft feels rushed, as if two different scripts were mashed together.", "This is a very strange movie... They've taken one of the coolest, suavest characters in movie history and cast him in this multigenerational \"grumpy old dad\" sitcom.", "Add this to the pile of crap legacy sequels like \"A Good Day to Die Hard,\" and \"Blues Brothers 2000.\"", "Not having a stronger, more serious plot means the film will likely appeal more to Shaft newbies than to Shaft devotees.", "It's a new way to approach an old character and it tries harder to give its main characters something to do than a lot of its colleagues do, and there is something worthy in that.", "If you are of a younger generation you will relate to many of the pop culture references that Shaft (2019) provides.", "Although a bit out of place for its time, the fifth Shaft film packs enough gunfights, wisecracks, and thrills to make it a decent entry in the series. Samuel L. Jackson fans will not be disappointed, and neither will fans of Richard Roundtree.", "For those of us weaned on 1970s and '80s television, Shaft feels like dozing off on a shag rug - an unconscious nod into a long, open loop of nostalgia that conjures an entire, and unique, set of sounds and textures.", "The messages are bad and the movie is bad. It's plain and clear why the studio dumped this on Netflix internationally.", "The proceedings are still intermittently fun, especially because of Jackson who is clearly in his element here.", "The script feels like it's been in mothballs since the term \"metrosexual\" was still a big deal in the mid-2000s."], "rating": ["", "6/10", "2.5/4", "2/5", "", "", "", "D+", "", "", "", "", "2/4", "7/10", "3/5", "7/10", "3/5", "2/10", "2/5", "1/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Candice McMillan", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Nabila Hatimy", "Damond Fudge", "Dan Scully", "Andrea Gronvall", "Luke Whiston", "M.V.
