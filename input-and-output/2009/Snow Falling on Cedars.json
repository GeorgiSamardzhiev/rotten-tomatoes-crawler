{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Fog as thick and palpable as cotton hangs suspended over San Piedro Island. On the bay, a flickering lantern signals distress from a crippled fishing boat, while elsewhere a freighter lurches blindly through the chalky mist. By morning, sea and sky are clear, but the tranquil village of fisherman and berry farmers will forever be changed. For one man has lost his life, and another -a childhood friend- has been charged with taking it. An investigation is launched. The trial begins.", "rating": "39", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 6m", "director": "Scott Hicks", "studio": "UniversalPictures,Kennedy/Marshall", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$14.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One big chill.
