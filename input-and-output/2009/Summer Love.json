The core pleasures of genre still have to be respected.", "Summer Love is fraught with feverish moods, bold imagination and a devilishly complicated exploration of the genre's iconography. It is also maddeningly paced, often like watching paint dry, albeit paint that's the garish tones of buckets of blood.", "It's an odd, disjointed, but curiously appealing effort that could attain cult status if only for the fact that it's so incredibly strange.", "Uklanski distances himself from the material at every turn, until it's difficult to distinguish the ironist's wit from the cynic's smirk.", "Summer Love feels more like a haphazard assembly of loose-knit components, jumbled together with obvious affinity for all varieties of a distinctly American genre.", "By eschewing any attempt at storytelling or character development, a film with all of the Western's fecund imagery and putrid fumes still ends up feeling as flat and distant as a gallery wall.", "The debut feature of artist Piotr Uklanski alleges to be the first Polish western ... There's no doubt that Uklanski has an eye: the film is full of beautifully composed shots. But that's about the end of its virtues.", "Summer Love has been called the first Polish western and the first Polish spaghetti western, though the truer description might be the first deconstructed art western.", "A mock spaghetti western that manages to be both parody and homage, albeit less western than spaghetti.", "'Whatever' is likely to be auds' response to this occasionally engaging but often ineptly made exercise in postmodern irony.", "The first Pierogi Western, Summer Love is such an observant sendup of the Spaghetti variety that it falls into the trap of parody in becoming almost too serious for its own good.", "Though unevenly paced, the film is a lot of fun to watch as it tries to skew and at the same time re-create the typical archetypes of the western genre."], "rating": ["4/10", "2/4", "", "2.5/5", "2.5/4", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Brian Holcomb", "Sid Smith", "Wade Major", "", "Jeff Shannon", "Sam Sweet", "Andy Klein", "Manohla Dargis", "J.
