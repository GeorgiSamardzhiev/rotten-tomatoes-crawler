It's all the better for it, since it's one of the few movies from this overrated auteur that I can personally stand.", "'Swamp Thing' may be more of a rubber monster creature feature than a truly accurate comic book adaptation, but it's a treat for fans of the movie and the graphic novels.", "Swamp Thing has many dubious qualities, but it clearly isn't a piece of product tested and polished to a blinding gleam, and the world is duller for not letting oddball efforts like this slip into theaters once in a while.", "The film is too lazy to provide any actual jokes with its send-up of the genre.", "masterfully entertaining film on a limited budget", "Has a novelty value absent from the equally broken comic book adaptations of 20 years later.", "...a disappointingly thin endeavor that seems to have been designed to appeal solely to young boys...", "A muddled genre confused mess of a film...", "About as much fun as being lost in a swamp.", "It's awfully likeable and definitely has a so-bad-it's-good quality.", "", "Oh yes, Adrienne Barbeau.
