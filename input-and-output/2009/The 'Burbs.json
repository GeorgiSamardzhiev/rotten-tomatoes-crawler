{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Settling in for some time off in his suburban home, Ray Peterson's (Tom Hanks) vacation becomes a horror when the Klopeks, a suspiciously odd family, move in down the block. Enlisting the aid of his paranoid buddy, Art (Rick Ducommun), and his militia-man neighbor, Rumsfield (Bruce Dern), Ray sends his son and wife (Carrie Fisher) away on a trip while he investigates the Klopeks. When a neighbor disappears, Ray and his cohorts risk their lives to save their cul-de-sac from the clutches of evil.", "rating": "53", "genre": "Comedy/Mystery & Suspense/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Joe Dante", "studio": "ImagineEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 1, 2017", "box_office": "$34.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One of the greatest comedies ever made. A sharp satire of American life in the '80s, when people were becoming disillusioned all over again after the '70s.", "It fumbles at the last moment... but this is still mainly a pleasantly nasty delight that was strangely overlooked in the cinema.", "There are a few genuine laughs along the way, but the story eventually falls apart at the seams and the movie's ending is patently ridiculous.", "It's inconceivable that \"The 'burbs looked good on paper.", "...presents suburban expansion as a cheerier version of manifest destiny.", "Sure, Carrie Fisher deserved a better role, but let's be honest-Carrie Fisher deserved a better planet.", "Much more intellectually complicated than the average romance, Train to Zakopan may be heading to the expected destination but there's a lot to see along the way.", "When it comes to the movies that get replayed frequently in my house, Joe Dante's The 'Burbs is easily amongst the top five on that list.", "It benefits from Dante's inventive direction, but it's hampered by an insufferable character in Ducommun's Art as well as an unfortunate (if predictable) denouement that totally upends the sturdy theme and edgy moralizing that would have made this unique.", "Also starring Carrie Fisher, 'Burbs is a hilarious look at suburban mischief pre-Desperate Housewives. Check it out.", "A fairly disappointing flop...", "The 'Burbs doesnit quite go the distance, but for most of its length it is a superbly inventive, insightful and funny black comedy.", "Tom Hanks should forfeit his Academy Award nomination for Big, now that preview audiences have gotten a look at The `Burbs.", "One of the most consistently overlooked movies of the 80s.", "This movie was directed by Joe Dante, whose style has become increasingly broad and abrasive since he made the clever Gremlins back in 1984.", "The script would like to be a horror film, a comedy and a commentary on suburban living, but it doesn't hit any target.", "[Director Joe Dante] excels at this sort of thing and delivers an intriguing picture, even though it threatens to stray into David Lynch territory but ultimately cops out. Bruce Dern and Carrie Fisher offer fine support to the affable Hanks.", "This black comedy is often hilarious, but is betrayed by an ending forced on Dante by the film's producers.", "One of Dante's most enjoyable films.", "Dated slapstick comedy-horror mix is silly but stale."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "4/5", "2/5", "", "3.5/4", "", "3.5/5", "4.5/5", "2.5/4", "B", "2/4", "3.5/4", "", "", "1/5", "2/4", "4/5", "3.5/5", "3.5/4", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["C.H.
