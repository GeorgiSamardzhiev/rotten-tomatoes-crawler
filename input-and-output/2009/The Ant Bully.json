Uplifting and bright.", "Ten year old Lucas Nickle ( the voice of Zach Tyler Eisen) stomps an anthill after an encounter with neighborhood bullies. With the help of a magic potion, the ants shrink the boy down to their size. The insects are about to get even and Lucas will learn", "...this visually arresting story of a young geek's friendship with some enterprising ants isn't as compelling in the script department.", "The film acknowledges that faith is an important part of our social fabric, and if the film has any moral lessons to pass on, it implicitly roots them in a spiritual foundation.", "The new computer-animated movie, \"The Ant Bully,\" knows a few things about bullies, most of which we already know--all of which bear repeating.", "Even without too much sentimentality, and without any musical numbers, this is a fun-filled animated masterpiece that should only be seen in 3-D and on a 70-foot screen.", "Kiddie-friendly toilet humour, a whiff of suspense and familiar voice actors make it passably entertaining, but there's little warmth or emotional satisfaction to be had from its cynical characters.", "Writer-director John A Davis has one or two nice touches, but the film is disposable.", "Besides keeping us entertained and occasionally thrilled, there's a nice sense that the film is actually saying something."], "rating": ["2.5/5", "2.5/4", "2/4", "4/5", "3/5", "2/5", "3/5", "3/4", "2/4", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "3/4", "B+", "A-", "", "2/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Leigh Paatsch", "Richard Propes", "Namrata Joshi", "Jane Boursaw", "Roger Moore", "Brian Marder", "Jim Lane", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Michael Dequina", "Brian Tallerico", "Frank Lovece", "Urban Cinefile Critics", "Roger Tennis", "Todd Jorgenson", "Peter T.
