{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Astrologist Hilary Cummins (Peter Lorre) works as a personal assistant to the eccentric and mostly paralyzed pianist, Francis Ingram (Victor Francen). A nurse, Julie Holden (Andrea King) also lives at the Italian villa to help care for Ingram, who plays the piano with only his undamaged left hand. Following a visit from a scam artist (Robert Alda), Ingram crashes down the stairs to his death -- and a plague of bizarre events ensues that are attributed to the musician's disembodied left hand.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Classics/Horror", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Robert Florey", "studio": "WarnerBros.", "theater_date": "Feb 8, 1947", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This is one of those semi-classic horror films which contains unforgettably creepy sequences and one or two great performances along with a great deal of fudged plotting.", "Lorre literally steals the show with a masterfully bravura performance in a superior slice of psychological horror.", "A taut, genuinely scary psychodrama which gave vent to Lorre's weird mannerisms and produced some marvelous special effects created by director Florey.", "Given the tenuous state of horror in 1946, it acquits itself beautifully.", "As it torments Lorre, the hand becomes a manifestation of the metaphorical notion of a hand tugging us toward our destiny or reaching from the past to punish us; an alternate, utterly appropriate title might be 'The Hand of Fate.'", "This is fairly spooky despite its silly story and modest budget", "It gives more credit for intelligence than the average thriller.", "Peter Lorre is so good.", "Peter Lorre in one of his best, and one of director Robert Florey's visual and psychological best.", "Since it is not cricket to divulge too many details, suffice it to say that Curt Siodmak's script explains the macabre goings-on psychologically and otherwise.", "The animated hand, creepy piano music, and Lorre's eye-popping performance are all memorable.", "", "", "Wastes a captivating original premise and some fine performances with a stiff script and a cop-out ending.", "", "", "Above average special effects together with Lorre's creepy performance make The Beast with Five Fingers well worth watching.", "Really creepy showcase for Lorre with a botched ending."], "rating": ["3/5", "4/5", "3/5", "7/10", "3/4", "", "", "4/5", "5/5", "", "", "1/5", "3/5", "B", "3/5", "2/5", "", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Kim Newman", "Alan Jones", "", "Tim Brayton", "John Beifuss", "J.
