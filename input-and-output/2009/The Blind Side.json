{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Michael Oher (Quinton Aaron), a homeless black teen, has drifted in and out of the school system for years. Then Leigh Anne Tuohy (Sandra Bullock) and her husband, Sean (Tim McGraw), take him in. The Tuohys eventually become Michael's legal guardians, transforming both his life and theirs. Michael's tremendous size and protective instincts make him a formidable force on the gridiron, and with help from his new family and devoted tutor, he realizes his potential as a student and football player.", "rating": "66", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Sports & Fitness", "runtime": "2h 8m", "director": "John Lee Hancock", "studio": "GilNetter", "theater_date": "Nov 20, 2009", "dvd_date": "Oct 1, 2013", "box_office": "$256.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There's too much emotional manipulation and huge problems seem to get solved a little too easily for it to be 100 percent believable, but it is an entertaining movie anchored by two very good, but very different actors.", "The plot of uncommon human kindness and charity is a formula for box office success and reasonable entertainment, but the execution is incredibly conventional.", "The Blind Side is that rare formulaic flick that actually works.", "Issues of race and racism are not left on the side, though, and the onscreen chemistry that [Sandra] Bullock and [Quinton] Aaron score is a game winner from the get-go.", "It felt tired and clich\u00e9d and the frequent and obvious emotional button-pushing failed to ignite any real response from me.", "This is a horrid film, and I hated it, and while, I suppose, you can't argue with a true story, you can always argue with the way it is told.", "... I must say that I doubt I'd like the film as much had it not been Christmas and just a plain ole good family flick to see with my mom.", "[It] is all about the family's altruism and turns a blind eye to silent Michael, with father Sean offering up the excuse: \"Michael's gift is his ability to forget.\" I'm not convinced but that didn't stop me from enjoying the film and admiring Bullock.", "The movie is done with crispness, vigor, down-home humor, and an over-all tang of good feeling, but the pushing of buttons is the work of extraordinary calculation.", "The movie is very familiar -- you've seen it all before -- but it succeeds at achieving its modest goals.", "As a fable about the power of giving, it hits pretty hard.", "It's certainly a heartwarming tale and Bullock delivers a big, ballsy performance as the indomitable Tuohy - but Oscar-worthy? What were they thinking?", "Serves its purpose by making the audience tear up in some moments and cheer in others. It's a total button-pusher, but it does so in a very good way.", "Football may the thread that runs throughout, but the movie is much more interested in the tale of how Oher left behind a life of poverty, violence and foster-home despair to become a champ on the gridiron.", "A living tribute to fundamental Christian motivations, although the point is hammered home with an extraordinarily soft touch: Love thy neighbor.", "You're going to be crying by the end.", "The Blind Side, which has reportedly made close to 200 million dollars, is based on a true story (the operative word is \"based,\" of course).", "Sing it together with me my brothers, thank the Lawd for he created the white man that he might teach them po' negroes the value of good Christian chariddy.", "While The Blind Side constantly threatens to deteriorate into sentimental saccharine, it never does. Bullock's accent grates at first, but she bonds well with McGraw", "The Blind Side's heart is in the right place--how could it not be, it's got so much to go around--but that's about all that is. There's a good story in there, one that's probably worth experiencing, but load up on insulin before you go."], "rating": ["3.5/5", "6/10", "3.0/4", "3/4", "2.5/5", "", "B", "3/5", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "3/5", "3/5", "2.5/4", "4.5/5", "", "0.5/5", "", "6/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Tom Meek", "Kate Rodger", "Deborah Ross", "Candice Frederick", "Brigit Grant", "Richard Brody", "Perry Seibert", "J.
