{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Two days before his wedding, Doug (Justin Bartha) and three friends (Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis) drive to Las Vegas for a wild and memorable stag party. In fact, when the three groomsmen wake up the next morning, they can't remember a thing; nor can they find Doug. With little time to spare, the three hazy pals try to re-trace their steps and find Doug so they can get him back to Los Angeles in time to walk down the aisle.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "Todd Phillips", "studio": "GreenHatFilms", "theater_date": "Jun 5, 2009", "dvd_date": "Jan 7, 2014", "box_office": "$277.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It may not be the most groundbreaking comedy, but following the drunken leads' exploits in reverse is a formula for a great time.", "What happens in Vegas is very funny, indeed.", "The filmmakers throw in so many forced elements of farce, that it dissipates the sense that maybe, just maybe, this kind of thing could happen to any of us.", "Here's a comedy that understands how to be raunchy and smart -- and isn't afraid to get a laugh at any expense.", "Galifianakis went from being an alt-comedy idol to a mainstream pop culture figure. The Hangover still feels like a breath of fresh air.", "Maybe, just maybe, the movie drags like a half-detached muffler and for some reason nobody wants to mention it.", "Though it looks like just another men-will-be-guys-will-be-boys-will-be-idiots affair, this well-scripted affair still stands up as a refreshingly unpredictable laugh machine.", "The movie, in the end, feels as as shabby as the unfulfilled lives that, we assume, these men will resume once the fun and games are over.", "In the case of The Hangover, Phillips made a decent diversion, but no classic; like its heroes you'll have a good time, then forget most of it when you wake up the following morning. It's a movie, not a film.", "... I went in to The Hangover with low expectations but ended up laughing more times than I thought I would.", "This is lazy, condescending half-assed filmmaking. When in doubt, simply slap a piece of rap music overtop of the action.", "The galaxy Galifianakis is beaming in from is infinitely more fascinating than the one this film occupies, but his visits from Beserko World are more than worth it.", "The kind of brilliant comedy that will have you gasping, laughing so hard you'll have tears in your eyes and rocking back in your chair from laughter.", "Just when you think things can't get any more farcical, they do: The Hangover is the Crank of comedy.", "If the movie's gleeful rush into areas of questionable comedic taste occasionally raises an eyebrow here and there, the end sequence will sear them right off.", "A younger generation is finding new stupid things to do underneath the desert sun.", "", "Starting on Monday, Coogan and Bryden share meals . . . and what passes for conversation. When they're not insufferable, they're boring", "I highly recommend going into this film blind, just to keep some of the surprises from being ruined. Oh, and being a 21-year-old male will also really help you to enjoy this flick.", "The Hangover might not be top class indie pop art, but the film represents the best of what comedy can provide -- pure, unadulterated, slaphappy entertainment.
