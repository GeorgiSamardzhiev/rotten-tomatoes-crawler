Armed with nothing but an old drum set, Frankie tries to get honest work as a drummer. But when his former employer, small-time con man Schwiefka (Robert Strauss), and Frankie's old drug dealer, Louis (Darren McGavin), re-enter his life, Frankie finds it hard to stay clean and eventually finds himself succumbing to his old habits.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "Otto Preminger", "studio": "CarlyleProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 1, 2008", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The scene in which Sinatra writhes and screams in pain and delirium is one of the most shocking I have ever seen on the screen. But it is strong and effective, and, I believe, justifiable.", "Producer-director Premlnger is one of Holly wood's most intelligent film makers. It is to be regretted that his artistic gifts were not channeled into a more uplifting drama.", "This dramatization of Nelson Algren's novel provides a sometimes revolting, sometimes dreary excursion into the lives of a full set of American lower-depths characters.", "Forgetting for a moment the contempt Otto Preminger has shown for the spirit of Algren's novel, he has committed the commercial sin of producing and directing a dull movie.", "Saul Bass's credit titles are as brilliant as one might expect after Carmen Jones but this is an unattractive film: not because the subject is painful, but because [Preminger], with his thorough skill, shows himself so profoundly insensitive to its pain.", "Sinatra gives a perfect portrayal of a man pulled out of line by forces stronger than he. Torn between his dream of a new life and the insidious circumstances of the old, Frankie is caught like a rat in a maze.", "The core of The Man With the Golden Arm is its horrific and honest theme. And Frank Sinatra's performance makes it valid. This is a strong, lurid and gripping film.", "It's not a pretty picture, but it packs a lot of punch.", "Preminger gives you the feeling of claustrophobia, to be sure, but that's not the only reason you'd like to get out. Along with in there is a growing sense of monotony and, in my case at least, an increasing disassociation with the whole shabby affair.", "The man who thinks The Man With the Golden Arm is apt to encourage would-be addicts just hasn't seen the picture yet. A better idea would be to show the film at high school assemblies. It's enough to discourage that first joy pop we hear about so often.", "It is not a pretty sight and certainly not fit for the young. But, it is brilliantly acted by the principals.", "After a while, its unbroken grimness... becomes monotonous. The spectator finds his mind straying from the fervid activity taking place on the screen. He may even get a little bored.", "Sinatra sweats out his craving for a shot -- thirst, hysteria, spasms, cramps, near-madness the will to suicide, unconsciousness, chills, and a hangover craving for sugar. Frankie makes it all look very terrible and very real.", "It Is an interesting picture but neither so interesting nor effective as it might have been had Producer-Director Otto Preminger subjected himself to a few restraints.", "It's a strong picture and not a pretty one, but it focuses a spotlight on a problem and uses no pink filter to soften the exposure.", "The main fact of the matter is that the Golden Arm film isn't by any means the sort of thing that has to depend on widespread sensationalism to get on record as both an unusual and a noteworthy picture.", "Honest, sympathetic, and highly emotional.", "Mr. Preminger's examination of a junkie is conventional, unimaginative and without any of the literary quality of the Nelson Algren novel from which it was lifted.", "Though the story is heavy and in some respects even harrowing, it depicts drug addiction as being so unattractive that it may well be considered a most effective weapon in the effort to combat the use of narcotics.", "[The Man with the Golden Arm] is a slice of life in the raw, garnished with excellent production and directorial values and spiced with arresting performances by Kim Novak, Frank Sinatra, Arnold Slang, Eleanor Parker, Darren McGavln and Robert Strauss."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Marjory Adams", "Hortense Morton (Screen Scout)", "Mildred Martin", "Robert Hatch", "James Morgan", "Helen Bower", "Frank Morriss", "Mae Tinee", "Philip K.
