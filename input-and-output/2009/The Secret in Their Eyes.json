Sometimes it makes a movie downright shallow.", "Its a fine story, but you already saw the better, tauter version half a decade ago.", "In this rendering, the story seems like little more than a made-for-TV kitchen-sink job about obsession... If there's a political message... it is hackneyed as well as crudely and artlessly delivered.", "All the glamour and intrigue of that original film is gone, and Secret in their Eyes proves that throwing movie stars at a story is not always the best way to tell it.", "This remake was a welcome punch to the gut I couldn't help but be moderately impressed by", "Sometimes a metaphor can be a prison too, shackling creativity to an under-considered thought.", "You just keep waiting for it to take flight, for some clue as to why these talented people are spinning their wheels with such subpar material.", "Judged on its own terms, it's a cut above routine - and the ending's reveal is heart-stopping - but those who enjoyed the original may find it comes up short.", "\"It's as interesting as watching the grass grow\".
