I'm not crying, you're crying.", "Cinematic alchemy of a kind that's all too rare, propelled by a supremely talented cast, a sumptuous score by Thomas Newman and a first-rate script and direction from first-timer Frank Darabont.", "A tough, complex story [told] with clarity, compassion and considerable dramatic force.", "The problem with the film's fablistic flooziness is that it also asks for investment in the harsh realities of its prison arena to buy the later Andy and Red push for freedom.", "One of the best out of the 1990s, and a towering force of dramatic power amongst films of its kind.", "It has the novelty to use plot development rather than unnecessary shock treatments to move forward.", "In the lead roles, both Robbins and Freeman are outstanding, layering their performances with snippets of individuality: Their small, daily sustenances and minor triumphs are wonderfully inspiring.", "This is an engagingly simple, good-hearted film, with just enough darkness around the edges to give contrast and relief to its glowingly benign view of human nature.", "Top-notch performances, exceptional cinematography, and masterful direction combine to make this film something special indeed.", "Simply marvelous entertainment.", "Freeman, who is simply a great actor, a man who has never struck a false note in his career, both narrates this tale and anchors it with his authoritative playing.", "Powerful, poignant, thought-provoking and finally irresistibly uplifting.", "If you don't love Shawshank, chances are you're beyond redemption.", "Spiritually moving old-fashioned prison pic.", "Gritty but comforting story of friendship.", "I love this film.
