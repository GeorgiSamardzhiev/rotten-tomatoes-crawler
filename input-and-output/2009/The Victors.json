{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A group of American soldiers manages to survive over the course of World War II, from the Battle of Britain to the fall of the Third Reich. Along the way, a number of unfortunate incidents occur. White soldiers violently abuse fellow black soldiers, a deserter is summarily executed on New Year's Eve and a sergeant takes advantage of a shell-shocked French woman. War is hell for the winners and the losers in this episodic meditation on the horrors that exist on and off the field of battle.", "rating": "20", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 36m", "director": "Carl Foreman", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Mr. Foreman's direction is generally artless, highly romanticized, and there really is not one good performance -- one strong characterization -- in the whole film.
