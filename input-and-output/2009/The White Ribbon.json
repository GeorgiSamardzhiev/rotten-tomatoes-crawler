{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Using their social status and harsh punishments, a baron (Ulrich Tukur), a doctor (Rainer Bock) and a pastor (Burghart Klaussner) rule over a small German village. One day, the doctor falls off his horse after it trips over a wire strung between two trees. More pranks follow, seemingly without reason, all directed at the village's upper class and growing increasingly more brutal with time. There are no suspects, but a local schoolteacher (Christian Friedel) has his suspicions.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "2h 24m", "director": "Michael Haneke", "studio": "LuckyRed,X-FilmeCreativePool,LesFilmsduLosange,WegaFilm", "theater_date": "Dec 30, 2009", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$2.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Haneke is typically elusive, but he does create an indelible portrait of a repressed, authoritarian society in which the sins of the fathers are being laid upon the children.", "An engrossing, mesmerizing and involving cinematic journey that is unforgettable as a journey that is both intimate and universal.", "The White Ribbon is one of the most gorgeous films in recent memory, with one of the blackest condemnations of human nature.", "The White Ribbon may present difficult themes and have spiky edges and perhaps could not be described as entertainment but, as a piece of cinema, it is undoubtedly stunning.", "Haneke both enthralls and repells us, luring us into a world where all feelings are buried deep beneath the quaint and idyllic surface.", "Haneke's rigorous control of his material is so unerring, and the acting so eerily and chillingly perfect, it works simply as a portrait of this community at this particular time.", "The themes, though sometimes applied heavy-handedly, have timeless meaning.", "Suffice it to say that I don't understand the rave reviews that this picture received, and I was not a happy camper when I left the theater.", "But along with a finely crafted screenplay, the film's truly brilliant touch, and what makes this nightmarish fable all the more effective and original, is its stunning black and white photography.", "The White Ribbon breathes an unholy life into the generation of children who would grow up to become the obedient soldiers and members of the Nazi party.", "It magnetizes us through profound degrees of mystery, psychology, dramatic intensity and perceptive dialogue, and then still retains enough power after the closing credits to leave us in thoughtful contemplation of its more cerebral perspectives.", "After reflecting on the film awhile, I found that I had been drawn into its beauty and its mystery too much not to give it at least a slight recommendation.", "As for Haneke's handling of the material, his directing is immaculate. Every moment is the product of a penetrating mind and a steady talent.", "This film is a total drag to watch. It is slow. It is dark. It is depressing, and it seems as though it is never going to end. It is torture to sit through this film. It runs 144 minutes and seems twice that long.", "The White Ribbon is Michael Haneke's masterpiece. It is not a movie about abstract concepts or a director's power over his characters - well, at least it's not just about those things.", "Un inquietante cuadro social, filmado en riguroso blanco y negro, y una reflexin sombra y perturbadora sobre el origen del mal, o al menos de cierto tipo de males.", "The White Ribbon is a striking, in many ways indelible work, and it's tempting to be carried away by Haneke's craft and assurance as a filmmaker.", "Up close, it's a blur of meticulous details that don't quite make sense; but step back and its towering ambitions become indelibly apparent.", "A direct and simple human lesson -- that negative reinforcement creates negative consequences.", "Haneke knows how violence seeps into every recess of our lives, and he evokes it not to titillate, but to engage and challenge"], "rating": ["", "4.0/4", "", "5/5", "3.5/4", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "4/4", "3/4", "", "F", "5/5", "5/5", "", "4/5", "9/10", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jason Best", "Richard Propes", "Felicia Feaster", "Nikki Baughan", "Matthew Lucas", "Deborah Ross", "Brandy McDonnell", "Ed Koch", "Pamela Jahn", "Jeffrey Edalatpour", "David Keyes", "Jeff Beck", "Stanley Kauffmann", "Robert Roten", "Simon Miraudo", "Enrique Buchichio", "Jon Frosch", "Matt Glasby", "Jeffrey Chen", "James Kendrick"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Talk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Charleston City Paper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Roll Credits", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">From the Front Row", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Oklahoman", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Atlantic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Electric Sheep", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Rumpus", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaphile.org", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Examiner.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New Republic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Laramie Movie Scope", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Quickflix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Uruguay Total", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Stranger (Seattle, WA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flicks.co.nz", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Window to the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Q Network Film Desk"], "date": ["November 25, 2020", "September 27, 2020", "January 23, 2020", "October 25, 2019", "June 6, 2019", "August 30, 2018", "August 14, 2018", "January 13, 2018", "September 27, 2017", "September 18, 2017", "May 27, 2015", "September 24, 2012", "September 20, 2012", "January 19, 2011", "October 21, 2010", "October 7, 2010", "September 10, 2010", "August 26, 2010", "July 17, 2010", "July 6, 2010"]}}
