{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When straight-arrow agent Roy Clayton (Guy Pearce) assumes command of a special FBI task force, he becomes entangled in a web of covert operations. All the clues in Clayton's investigation point to Samir Horn (Don Cheadle), a former Special Ops soldier who now aids terrorists. But as Clayton digs deeper and contradictory evidence begins to emerge, he begins to question Horn's motives.", "rating": "65", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Jeffrey Nachmanoff", "studio": "MandevilleFilms,Crescendo,HydeParkEntertainment", "theater_date": "Aug 27, 2008", "dvd_date": "Mar 10, 2017", "box_office": "$23.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Writer-director Jeffrey Nachmanoff bends over backwards to be even-handed, but his attempts at balance come over as earnestly unsubtle.", "[Traitor] is, however, a solid thriller, exhilarating when it needs to be and entertaining throughout, with another exemplary performance from Cheadle at its heart.", "The more I think about this movie, the better it gets.", "Traitor succeeds in painting a multihued, nuanced picture that is much more satisfying than paint-by-numbers conclusions.", "...one can't help but embrace the slow-moving narrative to an increasingly palpable degree.", "", "Simmers down into a reasonably smart little thriller with a moral conscience, yet.", "If it doesn't succeed in challenging you perception of the war on terror, it might challenge your view on Steve Martin.", "Surprisingly, Steve Martin created this story. In a decade of wild and crazy fictional terrorism, his was the most horrifyingly plausible - one that spun terrorism as drama into uncomfortable community theater, striking the country's friendliest corners.", "We watch for the sake of the chase, and while it's a chase that certainly proves better than most, it's also one that is good enough to have been even better than that.", "As a thriller, Traitor excels and feels especially relevant, considering the subject matter.", "The action scenes will grab you, but there's an actual story here, too.", "Much harder to see coming is the film's denouement, but that's only because of its extreme silliness.", "A certain interest resides in the film's even-handedness.", "As the eponymous terrorist, Cheadle makes a big impact without too much noise.", "Traitor is undeniably an intelligent, watchable thriller that wisely steers clear of racial stereotyping, yet manages to fall short of delivering a wholly satisfying cerebral or visceral experience.", "The result is an absorbing, old-fashioned drama without the gung-ho rhetoric you might have expected.", "A globe-trotting conspiracy thriller that is a little too complicated for its own good.", "Traitor has its faults. It's overlong, contrived in parts and ultimately resorts to some predictable tactics. The irresistible question is whether the US would be making films like this if 9/11 hadn't happened.", "Strong turns from Cheadle and Pearce elevate an ambitious suspenser with a keen eye for the duplicities that propel the War On Terror.
