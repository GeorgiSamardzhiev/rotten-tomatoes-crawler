{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Along the Welsh coast lies a village called Llareggub -- or \"bugger all\" backwards -- which is peopled with eccentrics like Captain Cat (Peter O'Toole), a seafaring man who is losing his sight; the sexy Rosie Probert (Elizabeth Taylor) ; and Mr. Waldo, a jack-of-all-trades who is full of regret. Adapted from Dylan Thomas' 1954 radio play, this drama welcomes audiences into secret dreams of these curious residents over the course of a typical day in this atypical town.", "rating": "64", "genre": "Art House & International/Classics/Comedy/Drama/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Andrew Sinclair", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 9, 2005", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The winning film of the moment is Under Milk Wood, Andrew Sinclair's beautiful screen adaptation of the Dylan Thomas play, a triumph of visualization of the verbal visions and vignettes the poet created.", "Intended solely for the fans of Thomas and for those of intelligent character studies.", "Unwise physical materialisation of a play for voices.", "The images that Director Andrew Sinclair has added to his film adaptation do not complement Thomas' language; they detract from it.", "All things considered, this is a fairly good adaptation of an impossible play to adapt.", "Writer-director Andrew Sinclair has a wonderful feel for his material, and a happy hand in matching it to its setting.", "Too many words, I'm convinced, for the screen. It's not simply the quantity of words, though. It's also their ornateness. They overflow the ears and get into the eyes.", "Fairly creaky.", "The film, faithful to the poem, offers an endearing, often humorous, examination of Welsh life.", "A loving adaptation and...a fine introduction to Thomas's poetry", "Marvelous adaptation of the Dylan Thomas radio play.
