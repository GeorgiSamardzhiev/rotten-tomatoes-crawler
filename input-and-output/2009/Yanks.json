Yet little that's exciting ever happens in the picture.", "Yanks is so much better than I expected that I hope I don't overrate it.", "Yanks has a richness to it in both its technical and its human elements. Many of the episodes shine with emotional clarity and understanding, and they all reflect the sheen of Schlesinger's craft.", "In every decade, a truly memorable motion picture comes along that, sometimes, if we're lucky, can enrich our lives. Yanks will be the one from the 1970s that future audiences and historians will remember, and cherish.", "Though some of the photography is stunning and the mood of wartime Europe is warmly rendered, this is not a movie to write home about.", "This pleasing effort from director John Schlesinger glows with a homely period charm, but never descends into sentimentality.", "The mise-en-sc\u00e8ne is good, as well as the actors, gags, and landscapes.
