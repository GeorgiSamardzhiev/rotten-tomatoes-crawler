{"metadata": {"synopsis": "While exploring a remote canyon in Utah, mountaineer and adventurer Aron Ralston (James Franco) becomes trapped when a boulder falls on his arm. Over the next five days, Ralston examines his life and considers his options, leading him to an agonizing choice: to amputate his arm so that he can extricate himself and try to make his way back to civilization or remain pinned to the canyon wall and likely die.

[Full review in Spanish]", "Boyle, in his always rather excessive way, throws an arsenal of visual resources so as not to turn the story of Aron into that of a guy locked in a square meter. [Full review in Spanish]", "Where the movie succeeds... it succeeds so well it's amazing.", "Franco... delivers a solid performance as the strapping climber who shows his vulnerability when he reflects back on his life--the mistakes he's made and the moments he may miss.", "Though I knew how the film was going to end, it made no difference. It had me from the beginning. It never lags. James Franco as Ralston is brilliant.", "Mr. Boyle does succeed smashingly in holding your attention, peppering in healthy doses of flashbacks and fantasies between Mr. Ralston's monologues and his attempts to free himself."], "rating": ["5/10", "3.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "3.2/5", "A-", "2/5", "B+", "A-", "4/5", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "", "B", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Leigh Paatsch", "Felicia Feaster", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "David Harris", "Micheal Compton", "PJ Nabarro", "Abbie Bernstein", "Kiko Martinez", "Daniel Green", "Deborah Ross", "Kaleem Aftab", "A.S.
