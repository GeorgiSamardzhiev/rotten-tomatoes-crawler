{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this 1980s sci-fi classic, small-town California teen Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) is thrown back into the '50s when an experiment by his eccentric scientist friend Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) goes awry. Traveling through time in a modified DeLorean car, Marty encounters young versions of his parents (Crispin Glover, Lea Thompson), and must make sure that they fall in love or he'll cease to exist. Even more dauntingly, Marty has to return to his own time and save the life of Doc Brown.", "rating": "96", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "Robert Zemeckis", "studio": "UniversalPictures,AmblinEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 8, 2013", "box_office": "$247.0K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Fox, who was doing double duty while making the first film (he was still working on his sitcom, Family Ties at the same time) was the perfect Marty.", "By far one of the most competent time travel movies ever made, addressing even the most common loopholes and pitfalls.", "It is the perfect package of entertainment, drama, comedy, excitement, and heart, wrapped up in special effects that still look convincing.", "\"Back to the Future\" is the best comic-strip movie I've seen this year. It's well-made, lighthearted and is exactly the right length to give you excitement and laughs and a few surprises, and then it's over, leaving you feeling good.", "The play on culture swaps is neatly done, and director Robert Zemeckis keeps it all fairytale-like and family friendly.", "One of the few perfect films that truly deserves to sit on the pedestal it rests on. [Full review in Spanish]", "There isn't a wasted scene.", "The 1985 original, in which Marty and Doc zoom 30 years back to 1955, remains the best.", "A great mix of fantasy, humor and drama, with a light tone but not in a ridiculous way and with well built characters you can identify with. [Full review in Spanish]", "Zemeckis and Gale have cannily chosen the time periods, which are funny as much for their similarities (political and materalistic) as their contrasts (music, fashions, language).", "Though it is hardly one of the greater flights of cinematic imagination to be seen since science fantasy reared its head as mass appeal material again, it would be virtually impossible not to enjoy it in some way or another.", "Every bit as classy, clever and cockle-warming as it was 30 years ago.", "Kids and parents alike are gonna dig this wonderful fantasy.", "Zemeckis and Gale have given the movie a core of feeling that makes real claims on us. For all its comedy, Back to the Future is about a kid coming to terms with his parents' inadequacies, a moment familiar to everyone, and the fulcrum in growing up.", "This fusion of sci-fi, action, romance and comedy could have been a dreadful mess, were it not for writer-director Robert Zemeckis and co-writer Bob Gale's refusal to let a loose line or idea escape their pens.", "The humour, the pathos, the tension - even the blooming soundtrack - all conspire to ensure that the tale of a teenager traveling back 30 years to ensure his parents meet and ultimately mate can, given its vintage, now be fairly described as a classic.", "Under the splendid direction of Robert Zemeckis, who also co-authored the screenplay with Bob Gale, Back to the Future is a joyous flight into the domain of a teen-ager`s fantasy.", "Just sign on for the trip. Back to the Future offers the summer's most dazzling joyride.", "It isn't often that extremely clever moviemakers use their brains in the service of pure fun. But that's just what the people who made Back to the Future have done. This brilliant contraption of a film could become the hit of the summer.", "It's big, cartoonish and empty, with an interesting premise that is underdeveloped and overproduced."], "rating": ["5/5", "1", "", "4/4", "3/4", "5/5", "A+", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "4/4", "", "5/5", "3.5/4", "", "5/5", "5/5", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Allison Rose", "Mike Massie", "Allen Almachar", "Joseph Gelmis", "Tom Meek", "Fico Cangiano", "Rachel Wagner", "Matt Brunson", "Sebastian Zavala Kahn", "Lou Lumenick", "Derek Malcolm", "Tom Huddleston", "Kathleen Carroll", "Paul Attanasio", "Mark Monahan", "James O&#39;Brien", "Roger Hurlburt", "Peter Travers", "Jay Boyar", "Sheila Benson"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">FlickDirect", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cambridge Day", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineXpress Podcast", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinencuentro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Mail (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times"], "date": ["October 19, 2020", "August 31, 2020", "August 4, 2020", "June 26, 2020", "May 4, 2020", "April 13, 2020", "April 18, 2019", "October 24, 2015", "October 21, 2015", "October 21, 2015", "October 21, 2015", "October 20, 2015", "July 7, 2015", "June 23, 2015", "June 23, 2015", "June 26, 2013", "June 26, 2013", "June 26, 2013", "June 26, 2013", "June 26, 2013"]}}
