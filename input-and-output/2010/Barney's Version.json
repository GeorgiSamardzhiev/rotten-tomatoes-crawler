{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Toward the end of his life, Barney Panofsky (Paul Giamatti) looks back on his triumphs and tragedies, beginning with an ill-fated relationship with Clara (Rachelle Lefevre), whom he marries when she becomes pregnant. When that falls apart, he moves back home to Montreal and gets married twice more, finally finding contentment with Miriam (Rosamund Pike), his third wife. Through it all, Barney is sustained by his work in television, raising children and the advice of his father (Dustin Hoffman).", "rating": "78", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 12m", "director": "Richard J.

Without any peaks of laugh-out-loud hilarity, you end up counting the seconds until the next quiet, serious conversation.", "Watching Barney search for happiness in the most graceless ways is uncomfortable at times, but his sincere personality peers through enough from behind his callous exterior to inspire sympathy for him without dismissing his countless flaws.", "Messy, melodramatic and meandering, just like life.", "Giamatti and Hoffman are so much fun, and they are tied to a narrative that, while slightly overambitious, never flags", "It's Giamatti's performance that makes the film work because Barney is not an easy man to like.", "Director Richard J. Lewis never quite gets a handle on the sprawling storyline and stumbles over the tonal shifts... but Giamatti holds the center together.", "A minor improvement over Mordecai Richler's nigh unreadable book...", "Paul Giamatti is one of those actors whose presence in a movie generally validates it, and Barney's Version is no exception. He manages to make a central character with few-if any-admirable traits not only bearable but downright compelling. And...", "An initially engrossing but progressively rambling and schmaltzy film that's mostly saved by a set of fine, if not exceptional performances.", "Barney's Version starts fumblingly in picaresque mode, and only really hits its narrative and emotional stride in its second half.", "Giammatti is on the top of his game in this Pitch black comedy.", "If there's such a thing as a filmmaker treating its subject matter too affectionately, then this is that, and it makes you wonder why you should even keep watching.", "The ever-impressive Paul Giamatti (American Splendour, John Adams) shines in this rambling Canadian character study.", "Mordecai Richler's 1997 acclaimed best seller novel is never fleshed out.", "It takes a little while to warm up but Barney's Version is a charming film that will leave you reflecting on your own life.", "True love and fine cigars feature in the charming Barney's Version, a blend of intelligent comedy and stirring drama headlined by a career best Paul Giamatti."], "rating": ["3.5/5", "C+", "1.8/5", "4/5", "2/5", "B+", "2.5/4", "7", "", "", "2/4", "", "3/5", "", "4/5", "2.5/5", "3/5", "C", "B+", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Brent McKnight", "David Harris", "Nikki Baughan", "Ivan Radford", "Kiko Martinez", "Roger Moore", "Dan Jardine", "Daniel M.
