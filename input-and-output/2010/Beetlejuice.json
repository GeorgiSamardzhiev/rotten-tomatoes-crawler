When the unbearable Deetzes (Catherine O'Hara, Jeffrey Jones) and teen daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) buy the home, the Maitlands attempt to scare them away without success. Their efforts attract Beetlejuice (Michael Keaton), a rambunctious spirit whose \"help\" quickly becomes dangerous for the Maitlands and innocent Lydia.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Comedy/Horror/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Tim Burton", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,GeffenPictures", "theater_date": "Mar 30, 1988", "dvd_date": "Aug 15, 2008", "box_office": "$73.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["\"Beetlejuice\" is so exuberantly batty, so outrageously zany, it makes \"Pee-Wee's Big Adventure\" seem as somber as \"Ironweed.\"", "Keaton shines in this role, breathing life (pun intended) into an immature and manipulative ghost.", "Beetlejuice only manages to entertain from time to time, but it keeps us interested in the future projects of such a peculiar filmmaker. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The story almost comes off the rails, but Beetlejuice's charm lies more in the execution. The movie is crammed with visual invention and snappy comedy.", "Beetlejuice seems above all categorization, a fearlessly original piece of work.", "For sheer off-the-wall audacity, Tim Burton's demented Beetlejuice certainly demands respect, even if it's more enjoyable in concept than in execution.", "Beetlejuice is so memorable and iconic because Burton took chances and dared to be different.", "The movie's such a riot of invention we let him take it more or less anywhere.", "Betelgeuse doesn't fully emerge until the film is half over, but Michael Keaton makes a strong enough impression in the role to explain why the picture is named after his character.", "[Tim] Burton's marvellously imaginative view of the afterlife as a ghoulish extension of mundane earthbound problems is a visionary masterstroke crammed with wit and invention.", "An overly ambitious special-effects comedy obviously influenced by the success of Ghostbusters.", "Starting with the title, not much about this movie makes sense. That's what's fun about it.", "Amazingly, it all still feels fresh, even though Burton has since become something of his own franchise since.", "The film is a dazzling display of director Tim Burton's unique pop culture sensibility.", "Much as Joe Dante did in ``Gremlins`` and ``Innerspace,`` Burton delights in creating in live-action format the impossible effects of cartoons and comic strips.", "It's an experience, rather than another helping of the same old thing.", "Early Tim Burton is creepy, dark fun for tweens and teens.", "With its sophisticated yet accessible blend of comedy and the macabre, I knew Beetlejuice was likely to be one of those films I would never tire of. But a classic? It's been 20 years. I'm willing to throw that blue ribbon on it.", "Quite possibly the most bizarre and flat-out surreal effort of Tim Burton's career...", "Tim Burton's imagination jumped into the saddle and held onto the bridle with Beetlejuice."], "rating": ["", "4.5/5", "", "5/5", "", "", "1", "", "", "4/5", "2/4", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "3/4", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Joe Leydon", "Allison Rose", "\u00c1ngel Luis Inurria", "Steve Rose", "Dom Nero", "David Ansen", "Scott Menzel", "Tim Robey", "Jay Boyar", "Alan Jones", "Gene Siskel", "People Staff", "Ian Freer", "Kevin Thomas", "Dave Kehr", "Kyle Counts", "Scott G.
