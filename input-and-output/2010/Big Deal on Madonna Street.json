{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Best friends Peppe (Vittorio Gassman) and Mario (Marcello Mastroianni) are thieves, but they're not very good at it. Still, Peppe thinks that he's finally devised a master heist that will make them rich. With the help of some fellow criminals, he plans to dig a tunnel from a rented apartment to the pawnshop next door, where they can rob the safe. But his plan is far from foolproof, and the fact that no one in the group has any experience digging tunnels proves to be the least of their problems.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Art House & International/Classics/Comedy/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 31m", "director": "Mario Monicelli", "studio": "Cinecitt\u00e0,VidesCinematografica,LuxFilm", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 24, 2019", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One of the cases where the first of its kind got everything just about perfect, right out of the gate.", "Monicelli's seminal Italian comedy, a spoof of heist movies with great performances by Gassman, Mastroianni, Toto, and Cardinale, had major impact on many American satires, past and present.", "The only really outstanding element is Piero Umiliani's cool jazz score.", "A devilish black comedy about an inept gang of thieves in Rome that turned out to be a big influence in spoof heist films.", "", "...because the characters are so likable and their plan for breaking into the safe is genuinely interesting, it's easy enough to overlook the few dull spots.", "", "", "a non-too-subtle satire on ... the crime genre, with especially good pokes at Jules Dassin's heist masterpiece Rififi"], "rating": ["9/10", "A-", "", "B", "5/5", "3/4", "3/5", "3/4", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tim Brayton", "Emanuel Levy", "Michael Dequina", "Dennis Schwartz", "Jules Brenner", "David Nusair", "John J.
