{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Ali (Christina Aguilera), a small-town gal with a great voice, leaves a troubled life behind and follows her dreams to Los Angeles. She lands a job as a cocktail waitress at the Burlesque Lounge, a once-majestic theater that houses an inspired musical revue led by Tess (Cher), the proprietor. Ali vows to perform there and, with the help of a savvy stage manager and a gender-bending host, she makes the leap from bar to stage, helping restore the club's former glory.", "rating": "36", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts/Romance", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "Steve Antin", "studio": "DeLinePictures", "theater_date": "Nov 24, 2010", "dvd_date": "May 1, 2012", "box_office": "$39.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It has no story arc, no dramatic tension, just a lot of bump-and-grind. That'll be enough for people with a taste for camp but like the art form it is named after the movie is all tease and no follow through.", "You'll be hard-pressed to find a more vibrant, energetic and musically inclined film this year.", "Somewhere in this two-hour campy homage to the Golden Age of musicals, I found the film won me over with its old-fashioned and rather cornball simplicity", "Burlesque cribs from any number of trashy pictures about showbiz, but it's not nearly as much fun as Showgirls.", "Burlesque is so old-fashioned in its storytelling that it feels like what's happening inside the club is a time-warp from 50 years ago, while everything outside the Burlesque Lounge feels like \"Dancing With the Stars\" present-day in tone.", "In the end, Burlesque falls short in the originality and depth department but if you're in search of music videos masquerading as a movie, it just might be your ticket. Or soundtrack.", "Sure, the whole thing is obvious and silly and ridiculous, but Burlesque is really comfortable in its own skin.", "Awful.", "Reminds one too much of Coyote Ugly. [Full review in Spanish]", "The movie still has enough plucky \"you-go-girl\" spirit that you will leave the theater entertained.", "Magnificently awful.", "It hits all its marks splendidly: it's kitsch that never turns Quatsch.", "It's impossible to know if [Christina Aguilera's] actually acting, since the music-video cutting rhythms don't give her time to sustain so much as a compound sentence, not that the script provides any.", "Christina Aguilera manages to bring an unforced charm to her first starring role, making Burlesque a surprisingly enjoyable experience.", "Still, this isn't a movie about plot, or subtlety. I found simple pleasure sitting in the theater watching it.", "As Burlesque ground along its obvious and well-worn path, my inner voice indeed shouted, \"Take it off,\" though my request was directed toward the projection booth rather than the dancers onstage.", "And it's this tension that rescues Burlesque - a film cursed with being too competent to be a Showgirls-style guilty pleasure, and too ropey to be really recommendable.", "If Burlesque was just an Aguilera stage show, it would be completely satisfying. Unfortunately, movies require actual plot and dialogue and when it comes to both, the film leaves much to be desired.", "Burlesque is so bad that it's good: over-the-top, ridiculous fun.", "The only relevant choreography would have shown Bob Fosse spinning out of his grave."], "rating": ["2.5/5", "3.0/4", "B-", "2/5", "", "2/4", "2.5/5", "", "", "C+", "", "", "", "3/5", "3/5", "1.5/5", "3/5", "2/5", "", "1/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Richard Propes", "Micheal Compton", "Glenn Sumi", "Michael Smith", "Barbara Vancheri", "Perry Seibert", "Anthony Quinn", "Javier Oca\u00f1a", "Drew Taylor", "Luke Buckmaster", "Ray Pride", "Joe Morgenstern", "Sarah Carty", "Meg Grant", "Marjorie Baumgarten", "Catherine Shoard", "Lauren Bradshaw", "Ramin Setoodeh", "Peter Bradshaw"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">NOW Toronto", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Playlist", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Daily Review/Crikey", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newcity", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">RT\u00c9 (Ireland)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AARP Movies for Grownups", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Austin Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">PopSugar", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian"], "date": ["January 31, 2021", "September 4, 2020", "May 8, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 28, 2019", "March 28, 2019", "March 28, 2019", "March 28, 2019", "March 28, 2019", "March 28, 2019", "March 28, 2019", "March 28, 2019", "March 28, 2019", "March 28, 2019", "March 28, 2019", "March 28, 2019"]}}
