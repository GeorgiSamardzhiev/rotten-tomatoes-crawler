{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Jack Hartounian (Jackie Mason), a boorish but good-hearted real estate tycoon, applies for membership at a snooty country club, but is blackballed by the old-money WASPs, led by Chandler Young (Robert Stack). As revenge, he simply buys the club outright and turns it into a garish amusement park. Chandler wants to win the property back by challenging Jack to a golf match, but he hedges his bets by hiring deranged mercenary Tom Everett (Dan Aykroyd) to eliminate his competition.", "rating": "4", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Allan Arkush", "studio": "WarnerBrothers/SevenArts", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 24, 2014", "box_office": "$11.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Raunchy, over-the-top '80s sequel has cursing.", "Chevy Chase, as a socialite who sells the club to Mason, and Dan Aykroyd, as a psycho ex-Marine hired by Stack to dispatch his enemy, are pitifully awful.", "The result is a disaster.
