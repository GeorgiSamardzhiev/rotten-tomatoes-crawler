{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When Los Angeles private eye J.J. \"Jake\" Gittes (Jack Nicholson) is hired by Evelyn Mulwray to investigate her husband's activities, he believes it's a routine infidelity case. Jake's investigation soon becomes anything but routine when he meets the real Mrs. Mulwray (Faye Dunaway) and realizes he was hired by an imposter. Mr. Mulwray's sudden death sets Gittes on a tangled trail of corruption, deceit and sinister family secrets as Evelyn's father (John Huston) becomes a suspect in the case.", "rating": "99", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 11m", "director": "Roman Polanski", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One of the best screenplays of all time, even in spite of its Oscar-winning screenwriter Robert Towne.", "The epitome of contemporary film noir.", "It was with Chinatown that Nicholson made the world sit up and notice: he's in every scene of this film and he fills the frame with that heady mixture of knowing charm and explosive energy.", "[Polanski] handles the mechanics of the plot with a ruthless brilliance that is immediately involving.", "Chinatown is one of the great films. Period.", "Nicholson is terrific as Gittes, and Dunaway, as a troubled widow, gives the performance of her career.", "Lauded for its brilliant structure and build-up to a - you guessed it - shocking finale that still leaves me jaw-dropped after countless repeat viewings.", "In its total recapturing of a past, in its plot, its vivid characterizations, its carefully calculated and accelerating pace, its whole demonstration of a medium mastered, Chinatown reminds you again that motion pictures are larger, not smaller than life.", "Once you've seen it, Chinatown never leaves you. Like Jake, you can't forget it.", "The picture is a kind of pop masterpiece, bursting with vigor, ingenious as the devil, handsome, efficient, engrossing-and quite deliberately divorced from any reality outside a dark theatre.", "Chinatown is not just another Maltese Falcon or Big Sleep, to be dismissed as a contemporary painting that apes, however skillfully, an old master. It is, rather, a subtly updated version: an equivalent with significant albeit subcutaneous differences.", "An enduring masterpiece, with Jack Nicholson giving what ranks as one of his four or five greatest performances (and that's saying something).", "As private investigator Jake Gittes, hired to dig up some dirt on Hollis Mulwray, chief engineer of Los Angeles's water department, Nicholson saunters round the city delivering one-liners with offhand brilliance.", "Chinatown is deliciously, intolerably cruel as it toys with us.", "As much as I admire the work of both Polanski and Nicholson, I found Chinatown tedious from beginning to just before the end.", "This film is flawless.", "Polanski's telling of his tale of corruption in LA is masterly - thrilling, humorous and disturbing at the same time - and brilliantly played by John Huston and Faye Dunaway as well as Nicholson.", "See this film as many times as you can. Please.", "Unmissable.", "Trust Polanski to make disillusionment seductive - rather more luxuriantly so than Billy Wilder ever managed."], "rating": ["5/5", "1", "5/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "4/4", "5/5", "A+", "2.5/4", "", "4/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Matt Neal", "Mike Massie", "Simon Weaving", "Tom Milne", "Ed Travis", "Dick Lochte", "C.J.
