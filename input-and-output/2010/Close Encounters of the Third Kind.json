{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Science fiction adventure about a group of people who attempt to contact alien intelligence.

This means something,\" is everyman's declaration, a reassuring cry to the cosmos that your life matters, you matter. But it's also the artist's creed...", "Despite these flaws, it's a gripping film that touches a nerve because who's to say it couldn't all actually happen tomorrow.", "The person or persons responsible for the landing of the craft -- it is considerably more than a flying saucer -- on the Earth, the slow descent upon us of a city of gold, has made one of the most stunning shots in the history of movies.", "A pseudo-mystical story that turns out to be boring, poorly constructed, and too long. [Full Review in Spanish]", "I think what really struck me this time around was its commentary on media and communication.", "Alas, beneath the visual hanky-panky stretches a thin, hackneyed plot that was done to death in the SF magazines and third-rate films of the Fifties.", "What the film is 'about', in a way, is its own illusionism, the process by which it creates a world we are invited to share.", "40 years after the film's release, the only thing that's aged is me.", "Spielberg's wondrous movie has remained its own thing, which is something of a miracle.", "\"Close Encounters\" proves to be a magic act with dramatic interludes.", "A film of incredible power and intensity. It is also, and ultimately, reassuring.", "Time for another encounter.", "It's a big ol' mess of a movie, but an extremely lovable one.", "Spielberg's greatest work.", "Obviously [Spielberg] had a ball with Close Encounters, and his pleasure in tinkertoying it together makes it enjoyable, mildly funny and -- in one sequence -- even credible.", "[Spielberg's] new movie is richer and more ambitious than Jaws, and it reaches the viewer at a far more profound level than Star Wars."], "rating": ["5/5", "3.5/4", "5/10", "5/5", "4.5/5", "", "", "", "A", "", "", "", "4/4", "", "", "5/5", "4/5", "5/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Danielle Solzman", "Richard Propes", "Mike Massie", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Adam Kempenaar", "Donald McLean", "Bernard Drew", "Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos", "Rachel Wagner", "Martin Gardner", "Richard Combs", "Kirk Baird", "Sean P.
