{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When hedonistic but charming con man Elmer Gantry (Burt Lancaster) meets the beautiful Sister Sharon Falconer (Jean Simmons), a roadside revivalist, he feigns piousness to join her act as a passionate preacher.

Both the show and their relationship are threatened, however, when one of Gantry's ex-lovers (Shirley Jones) decides that she has a score to settle with the charismatic performer.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h 25m", "director": "Richard Brooks", "studio": "UnitedArtists", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 22, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The title-role character, a preacher with a weakness for wild women and whisky, is more believable in scriptwriter-director Richard Brooks' film than he was in the Sinclair Lewis novel; the part is played with skill and gusto by Burt Lancaster.", "Alas!

He also has written dialog that is frank and biting.", "This gets progressively nastier and winds up with an impressive hellfire finish.", "Brooks was the ultimate vulgarizer of serious literature.", "Burt Lancaster gives one of his most memorable and zestiest performances as the lustful, charismatic evangelist charlatan in Richard Brooks' loose adaptation of Sinclair Lewis 1927 powerful novel.", "With a host of fine performances, and a strong sense of period and place conveyed by John Alton's lush camerawork, there's still plenty to enjoy.", "", "", "Hypocrisy and religion exploited!
