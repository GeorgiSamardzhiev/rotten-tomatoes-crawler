A modern classic. [Full review in Spanish].", "[Jim Carrey's] vulnerability is stunning, and he has channeled his comedic physicality into a tightly controlled performance that makes the absurd completely believable.", "Without a doubt, one of the best films of all-time regarding love, heartbreak and hope. [Full review in Spanish]", "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is a whirlwind of emotions, and it is the kind of romance that is just grounded enough, in reality, to inspire and incite, but whimsical enough to deserve its own special place in the genre's history.", "With a tagline of 'Would you erase me?', I can only beg someone to erase Eternal Sunshine from theaters -- quickly.", "From the opening frame to the closing credits, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind  is unmistakably the work of a true creative genius.", "It's a surprising, clever sci-fi twist, even as the relationship drama it dredges up doesn't feel at all like science fiction.", "For all its high-falutin' references this is just another rom com with a bit of angst and ontological confusion thrown into the mix.", "...genius, or at least fascinating. [Full review in Spanish]", "The wacky sight gags and psycho-drama slapstick is tinged with melancholy and regret ...", "One of the most insightfully sad explorations of the human drive for love since Annie Hall concluded that we need the eggs.", "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind goes by like a fevered dream of love, but one you remember vividly, with profound pleasure.", "At its core, Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind could have been just another love story. Refracted through Kaufman's wonderfully weird prism, it's something truly memorable.", "The result is a cinematic vagueness that makes the film less aesthetic yet more persuasive. This is how dreams really look: like reality, only less so.", "Pretty fancy stuff, for a sci-fi romantic comedy.", "It's a very Kaufmanesque narrative experiment, technically ingenious and sophisticated. It also looks like some lost comedy idea by Philip K Dick; you could call this film We Can Forget It for You Retail.", "The latest and loveliest alternative universe created by Charlie Kaufman, America's most -- we should probably say only -- intellectually provocative screenwriter.", "This outing from Kaufman's oddball imagination is wonderfully intriguing, often touching and typically convoluted."], "rating": ["9/10", "", "4/4", "5/5", "5/5", "", "", "4/4", "", "", "", "", "1", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Allen Almachar", "Federico Furzan", "Sez\u00edn Koehler", "Fico Cangiano", "Kristy Strouse", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Matthew Lucas", "K.
