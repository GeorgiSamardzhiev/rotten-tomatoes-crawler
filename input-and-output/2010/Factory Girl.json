{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the mid-1960s, wealthy debutant Edie Sedgwick (Sienna Miller) meets artist Andy Warhol (Guy Pearce). She joins Warhol's famous Factory and becomes his muse. Although she seems to have it all, Edie cannot have the love she craves from Andy, and she has an affair with a charismatic musician (Hayden Christensen), who pushes her to seek independence from the artist and the milieu.", "rating": "20", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "George Hickenlooper", "studio": "LIFTProductions", "theater_date": "Dec 29, 2006", "dvd_date": "Dec 6, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Captain Mauzner's screenplay never really gives much insight into Sedgwick as a person, leaving more questions about the person than answers. Still, Factory Girl is worth a look if only to see Miller and Pearce.", "Never gets past the superficial.", "Far less insight than the flattest of E! True Hollywood Story segments", "In Factory Girl, a jumbled account of the short life and photogenic hard times of the first Andy Warhol superstar, Edie Sedgwick, Sienna Miller makes Sedgwick into an archetypal over-confident blond with a mannered young Kathleen Turner croak.", "Summing up a complex human being in two hours is like an MTV spot about Nelson Mandela cut to a Kanye West track. We don't really get to know Sedgwick at all.", "True story of drugs and sex is for adults only.", "As a bio-pic, Factory Girl is limited, but as a snapshot of Sedgwick and Warhol's fiery relationship, there is much to fascinate us.", "Factory Girl is an effective evocation of a particular slice of recent history. The film benefits from Miller's turn as Edie, an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink performance that takes the poor girl from the heights and highs of fame to the depths and doom", "As a biography of Edie Sedgwick, it's pretty near worthless, but as an evocation of both the glamour and the horror of the Factory, it's as seductive as Andy himself.", "les \u00e9crits de Mauzner n'arrivent malheureusement pas \u00e0 rendre justice, voire m\u00eame \u00e0 ajouter le moindre commentaire critique, \u00e0 leur source d'inspiration", "Spoilt, rich, posh, vacuous and fame-obsessed - who better to play Edie Sedgwick? If she's acting or not, Miller is brilliant. Just a shame the film is so shallow too.", "Edie Sedgwick's story is sad, but never appears important or interesting.", "It's Sienna Miller's star that shines brightest in this heartbreaking cautionary tale.", "Miller is a genuine surprise as the damaged star. But the film leaves her very much as it finds her: a clueless naive.", "Sienna Miller brings bright eyes and shapeshifting commitment to a script that doesn't always deserve it.", "Sienna Miller guarantees herself a bit more than 15 minutes with a strong performance in an otherwise dazed and confused film.", "Kudos to Miller for her touching portrayal of a doomed icon. A shame the film's as substantial as one of Warhol's silver flotations.", "There's no real need for Factory Girl; just go pick up that copy of Heat.", "In all it's an unconvincing portrait, and as the Dylan clone says, \"Empty, like one of those cans of soup...\"", "Sienna Miller is perfectly cast but the script barely scratches the surface and you never really get inside any of the characters."], "rating": ["B-", "B-", "", "", "2.5/5", "2/5", "", "3/5", "", "5/10", "3/5", "", "4/4", "2/5", "2/5", "3/5", "3/5", "2/5", "2/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Micheal Compton", "Dennis Schwartz", "Fernando F.
