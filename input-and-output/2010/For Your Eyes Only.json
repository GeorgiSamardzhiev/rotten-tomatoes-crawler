A great song, a charming ally, a creepy henchman, a terrific Bond Girl, and a genuine espionage mission - what's not to love?", "One of the more unspectacular entries in the series.", "This is definitely one of Roger Moore's best outings as Bond. Whilst Moore is naturally a charmer, in For Your Eyes Only, he presents Bond with a tougher edge.", "The picture can't quite shake off the increasingly silly legacy which had mired the franchise in the Roger Moore era.", "Some really good set pieces and some fun new characters round out a good entry into the Bond series, even if it does suffer from a bit of an identity crisis.", "For Your Eyes Only, however, looks like the work of people too smug in the belief they've got a good thing going to bother to make it interesting. It oozes unwarranted condescension.", "Most of the time, though, For Your Eyes Only is a slick entertainment.", "No. 12 in the phenomenally durable James Bond series. For Your Eyes Only is undeniably easy on the eyes. Maybe too easy to prevent the mind from wandering and the lids from drooping.", "This 12th entry in the 007 series provides no real surprises, with the exception perhaps of Roger Moore, who gets the chance to show a little more grit than usual.", "After 20 years, though, it's comforting to have 007 still stylishly triumphant and making the theaters safe for entertainment.", "This is the one of the better stripped down Bond films. It's not flashy, the villains are grounded and Moore dials his take on 007 down significantly.", "Gone are the big gadgets and huge set pieces. What we get instead are some decent car chases, fist fights, and practical stunts. The result is a pretty satisfying Bond entry.", "The grittiest Roger Moore Bond, it's an under-rated, gadget-light and stunt-heavy return to Cold War action.", "There are quite a few individual pieces of \"For Your Eyes Only\" that don't quite fit. But to borrow from its Olympic theme, its gymnastic flexibility sure lets it excel in the all-around.", "[Finds] a way to make even Moore's breezy quipping work in a more sober vein. It's serious without sacrificing escapist fun.", "Sea and ski with 1981's Bond in an average outing.", "It's the only Bond film where M didn't appear.", "First-time director John Glen knows what's needed to create suspense...put the series' trademark wit, women, and song alongside the high-stakes adventure of a more brutal 007. [Blu-ray]", "...suffers from a disastrously plodding midsection that ultimately casts a pall over the remainder of the proceedings...", "Roger Moore has crumpled his comic-strip good looks into something approaching world-weariness, and the newfound maturity in his expression is reflected in director John Glen's style, which goes for the measured and elegant over the flashy and excessive."], "rating": ["", "5/10", "3/5", "2/5", "4/5", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "8/10", "3/4", "3/5", "4/5", "8/10", "2/5", "C+", "3/4", "2.5/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jake Tropila", "Mike Massie", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "PJ Nabarro", "David Hogan", "Bruce McCabe", "Vincent Canby", "Gary Arnold", "John Ferguson", "", "Jeffrey Lyles", "Austin Kennedy", "", "Nick Rogers", "Tim Brayton", "Charles Cassady", "Dennis Schwartz", "Peter Canavese", "David Nusair", "Dave Kehr"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Inquiry", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Confessions From A Geek Mind", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">hoganreviews.co.uk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Globe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lyles&#39; Movie Files", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Geek Central", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Yap", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Groucho Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader"], "date": ["October 8, 2020", "September 6, 2020", "July 16, 2020", "October 29, 2019", "January 27, 2019", "April 27, 2018", "October 30, 2015", "October 30, 2015", "October 30, 2015", "October 30, 2015", "October 29, 2015", "October 27, 2012", "October 23, 2012", "October 13, 2012", "August 21, 2012", "December 15, 2010", "February 17, 2009", "October 25, 2008", "October 16, 2008", "October 13, 2008"]}}
