{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Harry Potter's (Daniel Radcliffe) third year at Hogwarts starts off badly when he learns deranged killer Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from Azkaban prison and is bent on murdering the teenage wizard. While Hermione's (Emma Watson) cat torments Ron's (Rupert Grint) sickly rat, causing a rift among the trio, a swarm of nasty Dementors is sent to protect the school from Black. A mysterious new teacher helps Harry learn to defend himself, but what is his secret tie to Sirius Black?", "rating": "90", "genre": "Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 21m", "director": "Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n", "studio": "HeydayFilms,WarnerBrothers,1492Pictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 1, 2013", "box_office": "$249.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Definitely not foolproof, like almost every time travel explanation, but this film nevertheless presents a new, creative angle.", "Hogwarts is back in session! And not a moment too soon. And although I've said it before, I've got to say it again, a technical and visual masterpiece.", "Good film directed for a teenage audience in which not only is magic taught but also how stereotypes affect it while the film itself recreates some British stereotypes. [Review in Spanish]", "It is without a doubt the best made film of the series.", "Prisoner of Azkaban baffled me and completely floored me...it shows that Harry Potter ages with people.", "Cuarn's Prisoner of Azkaban, while a touch less faithful to the details of Rowling's oeuvre, captures far better its mood, the constant sense of wondrous discovery and lurking danger.", "This Potter is terse, swift, sad -- and welcome.", "demonstrates how wishy-washy Columbus was in many of his decisions", "Cuarn brought to the Potter franchise a quality curiously missing from the two previous films: magic.", "OK, so the narrative may be a tad shaky, but what lends Azkaban its edge is the unabashedly creepy tone that Cuaron conjures.", "Turning 13 suits our intrepid Hogwarts students just fine in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban.", "It's the most moving and inventive live action children's film in years (and therefore, just as magical for adults, if not more).", "You could call this one Harry Potter Grows Up. At the very least, the transition from Chris Columbus to Alfonso Cuaron has helped propel J.K. Rowling's hero from childhood into the difficult teen years.", "It's arguably the most fun Harry Potter film to watch: inventive, quick-moving, playful, beautiful.", "What makes Prisoner of Azkaban so successful is that, like the earlier films in the franchise, it actually adapts the book from which it takes its name.", "Prisoner of Azkaban lacks the depth that those of us old enough to drive may have enjoyed in the earlier Potter installments.", "The right word for Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban is wondersful -- as in full of wonders, great and small.", "Cuaron delivers a genuinely spooky and emotionally involving adventure which gives the world of Potter much-needed character and atmosphere.", "Alfonso Cuarn brings a darker, edgier, scarier feel to this installment.", "Given arguably the best book of the series to work from, new director Alfonso Cuarn has turned out the best film to date, too."], "rating": ["7/10", "", "4/5", "A", "", "", "", "4.5/5", "", "", "3.5/4", "4/5", "3.5/4", "7/10", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Guillem Martinez Oya", "Rachel Wagner", "Jeremy Jahns", "Christopher Orr", "Antonia Quirke", "Kevin Carr", "Christopher Orr", "Mark Kermode", "Matt Soergel", "Christopher Borrelli", "Dan Webster", "Tim Brayton", "David Walker", "James Keith La Croix", "Joe Morgenstern", "Mike Goodridge", "David Aldridge", ""], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinematismo", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">JeremyJahns.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New Republic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fat Guys at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Atlantic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Statesman", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Florida Times-Union", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Toledo Blade", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spokesman-Review (Washington)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Willamette Week", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro Times (Detroit, MI)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film"], "date": ["September 29, 2020", "November 13, 2019", "July 11, 2019", "April 4, 2019", "January 26, 2018", "January 5, 2018", "December 14, 2017", "January 17, 2016", "November 16, 2014", "November 16, 2014", "November 16, 2014", "November 16, 2014", "November 16, 2014", "September 28, 2013", "August 3, 2013", "August 3, 2013", "August 3, 2013", "August 3, 2013", "August 3, 2013", "August 3, 2013"]}}
