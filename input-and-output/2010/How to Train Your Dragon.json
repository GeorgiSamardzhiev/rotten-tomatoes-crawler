{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Hiccup (Jay Baruchel) is a Norse teenager from the island of Berk, where fighting dragons is a way of life. His progressive views and weird sense of humor make him a misfit, despite the fact that his father (Gerard Butler) is chief of the clan. Tossed into dragon-fighting school, he endeavors to prove himself as a true Viking, but when he befriends an injured dragon he names Toothless, he has the chance to plot a new course for his people's future.", "rating": "99", "genre": "Animation/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Christopher Sanders, Dean DeBlois", "studio": "DreamWorksAnimation,VertigoEntertainment", "theater_date": "Mar 26, 2010", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$217.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Has all the ingredients of a blockbuster action film - yet it's a family-friendly computer-animated movie.", "The vocal work in How to Train Your Dragon is stellar across the board, most notably Jay Baruchel's delightful mix of vulnerability and hidden strength.", "A very good show about friendship and humanity in a great fictitious world.
