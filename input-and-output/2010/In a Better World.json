{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Anton (Mikael Persbrandt) is a doctor who travels frequently between his home in Denmark and a refugee camp in Africa.

When a new boy, whose mother recently died, moves to town and befriends Elias, it provides solace for both father and son.

A truly complex work of art.", "Un estupendo drama contemporneo sobre algunos de los conflictos ms bsicos que acechan a hombres y mujeres de bien en cualquier rincn del mundo.", "It would have worked better if it weren't so obvious and manipulative. About halfway through, it plays more like a diagram of lessons learned than a movie about real people dealing with complicated problems.", "The microcosm of the children's world is exceptionally well drawn.", "In addition to being safe and non-threatening, Bier's film finds time to throw in mentions of cancer and divorce, and images of poor children starving in Africa. It's pretty much a recipe for an Oscar.", "Essentially an essay about bullying ( ... ) and the abuse of power, it will probably be appreciated most by people who want to keep up with [Susanne] Bier's maturing catalogue.", "It's well made but too flawed to be a satisfying cinematic experience.", "The superb acting - the youngsters are particularly good - and Bier's sympathetic direction help overcome the occasional lapse into melodrama.", "Though the performances are excellent, it aint no Dogtooth.", "The film is built on strong performances and some powerful moments, though its subtleties risk being eclipsed by contrived emotional pyrotechnics."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "3/4", "4/5", "", "", "B", "3.5/4", "", "B", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "2/4", "4/5", "2/4", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Matthew Lucas", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Lisa Mullen", "Kaleem Aftab", "Kiko Martinez", "Josh Larsen", "Martin Tsai", "Kimber Myers", "Roger Moore", "Louis Proyect", "Enrique Buchichio", "Eric Melin", "Amber Wilkinson", "Jeffrey M.
