{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Unemployed young Irishman Gerry Conlon (Daniel Day-Lewis) gets by as a petty thief in 1970s Belfast. When local IRA leaders get fed up with him, he flees to England and meets up with his friend Paul Hill (John Lynch). On the same night that the IRA bombs a nearby pub, the friends get kicked out of their communal digs and are forced to sleep in a park. He returns to Belfast, but is arrested as the prime suspect in the bombing and imprisoned, where he spends 15 years trying to clear his name.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 12m", "director": "Jim Sheridan", "studio": "UniversalPictures,Hell&#39;sKitchenFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 10, 2015", "box_office": "$24.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Jim Sheridan tells his gripping tale with a fury that stokes up an audience the way early Costa Gavras movies used to do.", "Daniel Day-Lewis is remarkable.", "In the Name of the Father is a model of this kind of engaged, enraged filmmaking, a politically charged Fugitive that uses one of the most celebrated cases of recent British history to steamroller an audience with the power of rousing, polemical cinema.", "At every point, Day-Lewis is at the center of the story, and he carries the film with an impassioned performance. It helps that it's a great part.", "The picture turns into a kind of stylized morality play about the right and the wrong ways for Irishmen to respond to distorted portraits of their character, and it's terrifically effective.", "In the Name of the Father is a deeply stirring film that lessens the moral authority of the I.R.A., English soldiers in Ireland, the British police and the British government.", "Day-Lewis, so intricately repressed in The Age of Innocence, here offers a role reversal in an unreserved and emotional performance that throws caution and inhibition to the winds.", "If Sheridan didn't feel the need to pile on the pedantic subtexts, this would be an absorbing personal drama, rather than a vituperative, question-begging broadside.", "The complicated relationship between the rebellious Gerry and the quietly tormented Giuseppe is one focus of the film. The obvious political implications of the dreadful situation are another.", "This is a stirring and exceptionally well acted, though controversial, dramatisation of Gerry Conlon's book about the grave miscarriage of justice suffered by the Guildford Four.", "Day-Lewis outdoes his acclaimed performance in My Left Foot, making Gerry a character of palpable realness and complexity.", "In this powerful, Oscar-nominated movie, Jim Sheridan infuses a fact-based social injustice drama with a more intimate family tale of estranged father and son, splendidly played by Daniel Day-Lewis and Peter Postlethwaite.", "By the end of the movie, whether or not you're a member of Sinn Fein, the Brits' brutality toward the Conlons will get your Irish up.", "[Sheridan] works with such piercing fervor and intelligence that In the Name of the Father just about transcends its tidy moral design.", "Sheridan takes a controversial subject and gives it wider appeal by focusing on the family drama of two men who are also political prisoners.", "Miscarried justice often provides the vehicle for emotionally wrenching drama and histrionic fireworks, and such is the case in spades with In the Name of the Father.", "Letter-perfect performances from Day-Lewis and Postlethwaite do a lot more than a dozen editorials to make an unforgettable point about the miscarriage of justice.", "Director Sheridan chronicles the father-son relationship perfectly and also handles the courtroom confrontations skilfully without ever falling into movie melodramatics.", "The acting's so good it frequently transcends the simplicities of the script, and whenever Day-Lewis or Postlethwaite is on-screen the movie crackles.", ""], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "4/4", "", "4/5", "4/5", "", "A-", "", "A-", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "", "", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Ansen", "Gene Siskel", "Kenneth Turan", "John Hartl", "Terrence Rafferty", "Candice Russell", "Desmond Ryan", "", "Jay Boyar", "Sue Heal", "David Sterritt", "Emanuel Levy", "Richard Corliss", "Owen Gleiberman", "", "Todd McCarthy", "Kim Newman", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Cole Smithey"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com"], "date": ["February 15, 2018", "February 28, 2014", "February 28, 2014", "February 28, 2014", "February 28, 2014", "February 28, 2014", "February 28, 2014", "February 28, 2014", "February 28, 2014", "February 28, 2014", "February 28, 2014", "March 25, 2009", "March 11, 2008", "March 11, 2008", "March 11, 2008", "March 11, 2008", "March 11, 2008", "March 11, 2008", "March 11, 2008", "March 4, 2008"]}}
