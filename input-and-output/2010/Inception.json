The superior musical score that accompanies the film heightens the suspense and adds to the mystery sequences.", "Nolan masterfully weaves all these elements together, creating a second act that is breathtaking, suspenseful and thought-provoking...unfortunately, it takes us a good hour for us to get there.", "Lose yourself in Chris Nolan's dream-world. You may never want to wake up.", "A smart summer thriller filled with visionary set pieces, grand imagery and exciting twists, but its lack of an emotional center keeps it just short of greatness.", "A mind-bending thriller that is a complete original, cementing Nolan's status as one of this generation's brightest filmmakers.", "Imagine watching a bank heist in someone's brain, with layers upon layers upon layers (repeat) of deep meaning, suspense, action, mystery and ohmyf*ckinggod-what-the-HELL-is-happening moments, and you can imagine what it's like to watch Inception.", "...there are few directors operating on Nolan's level within modern-day Hollywood.", "It's the kind of conception that can only come from a mastermind such as Christopher Nolan.", "Inception is the apotheosis of Nolan's directorial signature whereby he seeks to merge ingenious narratives containing weighty psychological themes with genre-inflected cinema", "Nolan's Inception triumphs in the manner of the best summer blockbusters: it's awesomely original, hugely intelligent and, above all, enormously enjoyable.", "While elaborate, it's never indulgent. While involved, it's never impenetrable. Inception is a feast for the mind and the senses -- the kind of movie experience we dream of.", "It is the subplot involving Dom's wife, Mal (Marion Cotillard), that does the intellectual heavy lifting.", "No matter how you look at it - as a new take on the heist film, as a narrative mind game, or as a metaphor for filmmaking itself - Inception will thrill you into thinking about weird new ideas."], "rating": ["", "1", "3.5/4", "", "A", "5/5", "", "4/4", "3/5", "5/5", "3/4", "A", "", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "4/5", "A", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Ange Anderson", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Siddhant Adlakha", "Allen Almachar", "Danielle Solzman", "Drew Dietsch", "Sarah Knight Adamson", "David Harris", "Kate Rodger", "Matthew Lucas", "Micheal Compton", "Amie Simon", "David Nusair", "Nathalia Aryani", "PJ Nabarro", "David Sugarman", "Zaki Hasan", "Megan Basham", "Annalee Newitz"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bitch Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IGN Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Solzy at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Giant Freakin Robot", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sarah&#39;s Backstage Pass", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newshub (NZ)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Three Imaginary Girls", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Diego Entertainer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Zaki&#39;s Corner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WORLD", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">io9.com"], "date": ["December 30, 2020", "November 29, 2020", "September 12, 2020", "September 2, 2020", "August 14, 2020", "July 16, 2020", "June 19, 2020", "January 14, 2020", "October 24, 2019", "September 17, 2019", "June 7, 2019", "May 9, 2019", "March 8, 2019", "February 11, 2019", "January 19, 2019", "November 20, 2018", "November 5, 2018", "November 2, 2018", "October 3, 2018", "May 23, 2018"]}}
