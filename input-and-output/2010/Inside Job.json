Director Charles Ferguson conducts a wide range of interviews and traces the story from the United States to China to Iceland to several other global financial hot spots.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Documentary/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Charles Ferguson", "studio": "SonyPicturesClassics", "theater_date": "Oct 8, 2010", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$4.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Pragmatic and infuriating, Inside Job shows how our financial system falls apart when the ruling class is allowed to steamroll over the little guy in the name of wealth and capital.", "Inside Job dutifully details the weight of these crimes with an intelligent reserve.", "The end of the film is quite openly dedicated to the 'American Dream,' but Ferguson seems to have proved that this dream is a myth.", "Documentary filmmaking is where some of the best investigative journalism is being done today and this is a superb example of the genre.", "Inside job is riveting.", "Ferguson is so mad he's punching at whatever's in front of him. It's understandable, but this is more polemic than documentary.", "This eye-opening documentary is critical of both parties in its search for answers about the causes of the 2008 economic collapse.", "Who whacked the economy?", "As a documentary, this is a clear-eyed, steadily building prosecution against Wall Street. But, in the end, Ferguson's film is just a moot trial in which the defendants have already escaped scot-free.", "This is a powerful and coherent work that will explain where the money has gone. It just can't help get restitution against those who did it.", "More entertaining than Wall Street 2 while saying infinitely more about the iniquities of those that claim to work for us.", "This is a compelling documentary that will have you leaving the cinema absolutely seething.", "Ultimately, Inside Job will not have much to offer those who follow financial news reports.", "Inside Job offers a concise history in a documentary that speaks to everyone and knows exactly who's to blame.", "Muchos aspectos t\u00e9cnicos probablemente se le escapen a quienes no tengan al menos un conocimiento b\u00e1sico sobre temas econ\u00f3micos y financieros, pero cualquiera podr\u00e1 entender y compartir las conclusiones a las que llega este contundente documental.", "A forceful argument about the dangers of unchecked greed and brazen lack of accountability.", "Throughout, the interviewer goes beyond standard bland. From off-screen, his barbed questions are relentless in forcing heads to follow dotted lines and confront inconsistencies.", "We want them to go to jail and realize the horror of what they've done? Is that too much to hope for? The answer may be too hard to face.", "An insightful and very sorry tale of the worst kind of greed, this Oscar-winning documentary exposes the people behind the global financial crisis, men & woman who are still wealthy and still running the banking industry.", "Inside Job is far more watchable than it should be."], "rating": ["", "4/5", "", "", "", "B-", "4.0/5", "", "2.5/4", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4", "9/10", "3/5", "", "", "1", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Rocco Thompson", "Matthew Migliorini", "Shelagh Rowan-Legg", "Sean Axmaker", "Sr. Rose Pacatte", "Will Leitch", "John Hanlon", "Robert Denerstein", "Jay Antani", "Laurence Boyce", "Andrew Simpson", "Simon Reynolds", "Jeremy Heilman", "Mike Barnard", "Enrique Buchichio", "Jon Frosch", "Donald J.
