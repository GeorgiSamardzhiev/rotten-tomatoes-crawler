Anyone who thinks differently just doesn't have a sense of humor and needs to lighten up a bit.", "JACKASS 3D isn't just about the pranks and crude humor - it's a celebration that connected all of them and changed their lives ten years ago, when Jackass first aired on MTV.", "Ultimately, they just want to have a good time and take their fans along for the ride. On that front they're completely successful.", "I think it's because we've watched these guys get older without growing up one little bit, and since we can't all get away with that, there is a freedom and, yes, a beauty to watching someone else pull it off.", "All of this happens in 3-D and that's fantastic.", "", "The filmmakers never fail to take the low road every chance they can, but they must have laughed all the way to the bank.", "If you can't do something smart, do something right.
