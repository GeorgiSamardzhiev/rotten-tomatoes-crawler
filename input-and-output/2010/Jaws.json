{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When a young woman is killed by a shark while skinny-dipping near the New England tourist town of Amity Island, police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) wants to close the beaches, but mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) overrules him, fearing that the loss of tourist revenue will cripple the town. Ichthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and grizzled ship captain Quint (Robert Shaw) offer to help Brody capture the killer beast, and the trio engage in an epic battle of man vs. nature.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 4m", "director": "Steven Spielberg", "studio": "UniversalPictures,Zanuck/BrownProductions", "theater_date": "Jun 20, 1975", "dvd_date": "Jul 22, 2015", "box_office": "$260.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The father of all blockbusters, Steven Spielberg's film is a masterpiece under and above water. To this date, still makes me scared of swimming in the sea. [Full review in Spanish]", "Jaws remains a classic not just for how it changed the film industry, but because it is an exquisitely made monster movie that tapped into universal human fears and did so with iconic style.", "It can be appreciated entirely for its extraordinary entertainment value, nail-biting suspense, sense of adventure, and old-fashioned Hitchcockian scare-tactics.", "Even decades after its blockbuster release, Jaws is still horrifying, as well as terrifyingly prescient about the current public health and safety crisis.", "Here is the moment that would forever change how movies are made, marketed, and watched.", "The beauty of Steven Spielberg's 1975 classic is that you can choose how to watch it: as a summery, shark-bitten thriller or as an allegory about the failed leadership of institutions...", "...more interesting is where the political and personal intersect... which fits nicely with what the movie as a whole does so well, mixing the horror and adventure with the personal.", "Jaws was just the beginning of an ever-amazing career for Spielberg and has left audiences with a number of quotable lines including the very popular, \"You're going to need a bigger boat\".", "Master filmmaker Steven Spielberg doesn't show much of the most famous shark of all time, but you can always sense he's never far away.", "It is not only the most realistically terrifying film I've ever gasped through, it is extraordinarily well made.", "Sure, the shark looks a tad mechanical. But the film's still a masterpiece of suspenseful story-telling, aided by John Williams' brilliant score, ground out on a tuba.", "A perfect movie in nearly every way.", "With compelling characters, high-tension storyline, and top-drawer direction, it's as perfect today as when it was released.", "Jaws is a quintessential American movie.", "Jaws is what The French Connection and The Exorcist only posed as -- a horrific action story redeemed by inspired filmmaking. Jaws aims for the gut, but it doesn't insult the intelligence on the few occasions when it is required.", "This pop-culture masterpiece is more than simply a well-tooled thriller. Spielberg brings a sense of community, family, and humanity to the supermarket thriller from Peter Benchley, a book more designed than written.", "Jaws is a grisly film, often ugly as sin, which achieves precisely what it set out to accomplish-scare the hell out of you.", "Jaws is a splendidly shrewd cinematic equation which not only gives you one or two very nasty turns when you least expect them but, possibly more important, knows when to make you think another's coming without actually providing it.", "Relentless and intense, with characters that are the accurate realizations of their behaviors and special effects that dwarf the limits of the time.", "I don't think there's a more exciting talent at work right now than Spielberg, an authentic moviemaking prodigy, and perhaps his worst problem from June 20, 1975, on will be preventing success from making a nervous or artistic wreck of him."], "rating": ["5/5", "", "1", "", "", "", "5/5", "4.5/5", "4.5/5", "", "5/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "4/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Fico Cangiano", "Jordan M.
