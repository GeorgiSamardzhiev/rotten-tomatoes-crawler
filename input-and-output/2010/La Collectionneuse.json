Apparently. Eric Rohmer never will... he has produced one of the most tedious films that I have seen in a long time.", "The natural splendors of blue water, rocky shore, bright sky, and hilly terrain provide a serene setting for the eternal struggles of man versus man, man versus woman, and man versus his own worst instincts.", "To watch a film like this, or any Rohmer film, creates a sense of peaceful regard in me. He isn't afraid of losing my attention with too much dialogue, or too little action. He invites me to arrive at my own moral judgments.", "A translucent comedy of procrastination", "Almendros captures the beauty of Politoff and the scenery with an acute sense of detail.", "Wryly and delightfully witty.", "", "It's as if the film were a kind of living notebook for what Rohmer was to do later, with greater ease and refinement.", "", "Rohmer delivers a study of self-rationalization at its finest.", "", "Rohmer's impossibly light, graceful way of posing profound moral questions hasn't yet wholly coalesced, though this 1966 film does have his soft, slow rhythm.", "The film radiates with the charms derived from so-called sophisticated pleasures and a sneaky sense of perversion."], "rating": ["2.5/4", "", "", "", "4/4", "", "3/4", "", "3/5", "2.5/5", "7/10", "", "4/5", "", "B"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Matt Brunson", "Jan Dawson", "Arthur Ross", "Richard Brody", "Roger Ebert", "Fernando F.
