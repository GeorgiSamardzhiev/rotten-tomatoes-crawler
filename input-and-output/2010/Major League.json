{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The new owner of the Cleveland Indians, former showgirl Rachel Phelps (Margaret Whitton), has a sweetheart deal to move the team to Miami. But to break the lease with the city of Cleveland, ticket sales have to plummet. So Phelps hires the most incompetent players available, including near-blind pitcher Rick Vaughn (Charlie Sheen) and injury-prone catcher Jake Taylor (Tom Berenger). But her villainous tactics accidentally foster a can-do team spirit, turning the Indians into potential winners.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Comedy/Sports & Fitness", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "David S.

That's fine for baseball, but it's not the way movies are supposed to work.", "Somebody should tell Ward that winning isn't everything. Character is. And this is what his movie lacks.", "If you're looking for sophisticated wit keep going, but Major League is pleasant, undemanding fun.", "Major League doesn't try too hard or aim too high, but it is pretty funny.", "The absurdity of the Indians winning the pennant in 1989 helped make the film a lot of fun, and it was a great little fantasy for Tribe fans back in the day.", "A meat and potatoes '80s movie, that maybe doesn't 'taste great,' but at least is 'less filling.'
