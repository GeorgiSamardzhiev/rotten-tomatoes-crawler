{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Aaron Boone (Craig Sheffer) is haunted by terrifying nightmares of a city of monsters. He goes to see a psychiatrist, Dr. Decker (David Cronenberg), for help. But what Boone doesn't know is that Decker is really a serial killer. Decker frames Boone to take the fall for his murders, and Boone is killed by the police. But Boone is brought back to life by the monsters of his dreams, the Nightbreed, who in turn join Boone in his quest to stop Decker from killing again.", "rating": "39", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Horror/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "Clive Barker", "studio": "MorganCreekEntertainment,SeraphimFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 25, 2017", "box_office": "$8.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Unfortunately, the story moves a bit too fast to take in the mythos, underdeveloped religious aspects, impressive subterraneous sets, and slimy behemoth details.", "One of those situations where the monsters are more human than the actual humans.", "Nightbreed reads pretty firmly as a queer allegory, not just because of its very publicly \"out\" creator...There isn't a great deal of subtext, here; this is full-on text. Unfortunately, there's not a great deal more to it than that", "Midian becomes a place where people are cast off, a decision determined by those in power and forced upon those without any.", "A complete mess of a movie. This should feel like perfectly mixed fantasy and horror. But it's only laughable. [Full review in Spanish].", "Decent horror thriller which gets more renowned with age.", "Clive Barker is the Douglas Sirk of splatter.", "The Director's Cut is vastly superior to the theatrical version, expanding on the secretive realm of Midian and the monsters who reside in this underground lair.", "For all of its blockbuster aspirations, the clumsily vulgar script and uneven performances leave [Nightbreed] mired in b-grade horror territory.", "At its best, Nightbreed is like a living version of a coffee-table book, with each page filled with tentacled, quilled, or moon-faced monsters.", "Clive Barker's \"Nightbreed\" suffers from a very flawed and weak premise, one that doesn't even come close to supporting the two-hour runtime.", "The only really strong aspect of Nightbreed is the 'breed itself-there are some truly bizarre and imaginative monstrosities on display.", "The Cabal Cut finally captures what Barker was after, warts and all, reinstating depth, emotion, and a human presence to the story, which finds its fantasy footing once again.", "If you loved Nightbreed, The Cabal Cut will give you more of what you loved, but it fixes none of the film's shortcomings. It may even emphasize the film's story problems.", "CABAL CUT: We get a little more Decker, and quite a bit more redneck rampaging, but there is also inevitably a whole lot more Boone. Longer does not equal better, esp. in horror, and all this extra stuffing does not stop a turkey being a turkey.", "The pic remains passable only as a work that is all style and no substance.", "", "", "", ""], "rating": ["5/10", "B+", "", "4.5/5", "1.5/4", "3/5", "2/4", "3/4", "5/10", "3.5/5", "2.5/5", "2/5", "B+", "5", "", "B-", "C+", "2/5", "3/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Brent McKnight", "Joe Lipsett", "C.H.
