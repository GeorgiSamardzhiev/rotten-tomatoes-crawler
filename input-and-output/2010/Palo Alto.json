Far from perfect, but a solid beginning.", "While all the young actors are committed to their characters (though none of them particularly stand out), this film will likely drown in its own nothingness as far more thought-provoking teenage fare continues to prevail.", "Just because the kids can't make sense of their acting out doesn't mean the film shouldn't try to.", "The real headline is Coppola herself, though. I may not love Palo Alto but its substance and style are singular enough that I am keen to see what she does next.", "The reality is that for many, [these] four years are marked by a more moderate, complicated set of things, and not the relentless bleakness displayed in [the] film.", "The drama is scaled to just the right size: kids get into trouble or inadvisable situations, but there are no major melodramatics. We see them in their natural habitat.", "James Franco's collection of autobiographical short stories is adapted into a remarkably evocative film by Gia Coppola, granddaughter of Francis.", "Another week, another glacial outing from the ever-expanding Coppola clan depicting the oh so beautiful emptiness of American teenage wildlife.", "Palo Alto is as fuzzy, scattered and aimless as its protagonists' lives.", "The story tends to meander but the kids' ups and downs are delicately observed and the performances, especially from Roberts, are never less than believable.", "The director Gia Coppola (granddaughter of Francis Ford Coppola) gets under the skin of protagonists who seem like pampered, listless delinquents on the surface but who all turn out to be lost souls."], "rating": ["", "2.5/5", "2/5", "8.5/10", "", "", "2/10", "", "2/5", "3/5", "C", "", "", "C", "4/5", "4/5", "2/5", "2/5", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Lamble", "Nicholas Bell", "D.W.
