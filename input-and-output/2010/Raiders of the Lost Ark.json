[Full Review in Spanish]", "Entertainment that propels the audience inexorably from one excitement to the next.", "If you've only seen the more recent films and find them somewhat wanting, you owe it to yourself to check out the original to see how fresh and original these blockbuster films once felt.", "It's all done with such a great spirit of high adventure and good humor that you don't even begin to count the corpses... The finale suggests that Ford's Indiana Jones character will soon be back with further adventures, and I'm all in favor of it.", "Raiders is an assured, relaxed, impressive work. It's almost impossible to resist. It's no more substantial than cotton candy -- but it's easily the best piece of entertainment Hollywood has produced in 1981.", "This bullwhip-cracking action-adventure launched the series starring Harrison Ford.", "The script Lawrence Kasdan constructed from Lucas and Philip Kaufman's original treatment built a real structure for those breathless set pieces, and populated it with characters that moved far beyond the cardboard cutouts of the originals.", "Raiders of the Lost Ark could be a silent film at times, because Spielberg favors actions over words, telling his story with great camerawork. [Full review in Spanish]", "Raiders of the Lost Ark has more size than substance but nevertheless it's a delightful special big surprise package of a movie that should turn Indiana Jones into a national figure.", "It is intensely watchable, with the relentless accumulation of effects used here for the purposes of eliciting suspense rather than provoking comedy.", "Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite movie. I don't have to tell you why it's great. You know why it's great. Instead, what follows is a list of very personal moments.", "There is a charm and vitality to Raiders of the Ark, which Spielberg later admitted was \"the first movie where I actually shot the movie without thinking\".", "Harrison Ford embodies the persona of Indiana Jones with perfection and paves him as an iconic hero.", "This film is a volcano of creative ideas in full eruption -- the modern high action adventure against which all others must now be measured.", "Hold on tight, because it starts at full throttle and never lets up.", "Yes, it's as entertaining as you have heard.
