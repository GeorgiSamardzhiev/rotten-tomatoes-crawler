{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Although working-class Philadelphia boxer Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) lost his high-profile bout with the cocky world champion Apollo Creed (Carl Weathers), his Cinderella story has caught the national sports media's attention, and he now has the opportunity to capitalize on his sudden fame. Meanwhile, Creed is still smarting from nearly losing to some palooka no one has ever heard of, and arrogantly prods his newfound nemesis into getting back into the ring.", "rating": "71", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "Sylvester Stallone", "studio": "Chartoff-WinklerProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 31, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Rocky II, the sequel to Rocky, doesn't even add up to Rocky 1 1/4.", "Rocky II contains the flaws of the original: simplistic characterizations, saccharine romance, a tendency to cuteness. But it also fills the heart and quickens the pulse.", "Although Rocky II builds itself around a rematch between Rocky and Apollo, the movie is anything but a lazy sequel.", "Rocky II plays like exactly what it is: a \"greatest hits\" version of the original, one that's tasked with moving the story forward while also re-playing a lot of the same beats that folks loved before.", "Feels like the most forgettable film of the lot.", "By the punishing heft of the big fight, there is the clear hint that the series will soon plunge into an unpalatable patriotic fervour. For now, though, with its leathery texture of working class Philly-life it felt enough like reality.", "Sly sequel is as predictable as a gym workout.", "Taking what John G. Avildsen accomplished with the first film and then adding his own style, Stallone comes forward as an action visionary, with the fight scene a vast improvement when compared to the original.", "Stallone and producers Irwin Winkler and Robert Chartoff know from experience audiences love to root for the underdog and have concocted an irresistible final 30 minutes.", "Pretty good sequel, among several that followed, this time directed by Stallone.", "", "", "Considerably less satisfying than the original Rocky, but head and shoulders above the later installments.", "Sylvester Stallone's follow-up to his runaway success of 1976 is a little more threadbare in spots than the original, but it still has some conviction and spunk.", "...can't help but come off as the most needless installment of the bunch...", "\"Rocky II\" represents far more than just a good-looking fight. It's all about trusting in yourself and overcoming fear in striving for greatness.", "A very good sequel even though the result of the climactic Balboa vs. Creed rematch is pretty much a foregone conclusion. This is where the series should have ended.", "Stallone's performance as a Philadelphia saint in a B movie physique leaves you undecided whether to gag or sob, but the final fight sequences make up for it; a full-blooded Hollywood finale reaching giddy heights of cathartic glee.", "", ""], "rating": ["", "", "3/4", "", "", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "4/5", "2/5", "3.5/4", "", "2.5/4", "4/4", "B+", "", "3/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Bernard Drew", "Bob Thomas", "Matt Brunson", "Zaki Hasan", "Brian Grubb", "Ian Nathan", "Charles Cassady", "Matthew Pejkovic", "Variety Staff", "Steve Crum", "Cole Smithey", "John A.
