{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Businessman Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) arrives in Krakow in 1939, ready to make his fortune from World War II, which has just started. After joining the Nazi party primarily for political expediency, he staffs his factory with Jewish workers for similarly pragmatic reasons. When the SS begins exterminating Jews in the Krakow ghetto, Schindler arranges to have his workers protected to keep his factory in operation, but soon realizes that in so doing, he is also saving innocent lives.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "3h 15m", "director": "Steven Spielberg", "studio": "UniversalPictures,AmblinEntertainment", "theater_date": "Dec 15, 1993", "dvd_date": "Mar 5, 2013", "box_office": "$96.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Framing and imagery demonstrate artistry even while capturing subject matter of extreme obscenity.", "Spielberg's finest work.", "(Schindler's List) slowly surrounds you, like a gang of bullies moving in one by one, before holding you down and beating you into submission.", "By dramatizing the Holocaust with such vividness and scale, Spielberg has helped to pass its lessons on to future generations.", "The film's epic sweep and grasp of detail are exemplary, while some scenes could make even a lump of granite weep. This is Spielberg's most grown-up film.", "The story of a righteous rescue mission amid unimaginable horror...a sober, historical drama.", "With its black-and-white bleakness and its fiercely insistent realism, Schindler's List is a hallucinogenic experience. It is one of the most finely calibrated, most overtly mournful, most nakedly authentic films ever made.", "...Schindler's List is essential cinema...", "Schindler's List is monumental because it demands that we imagine the abominable, but it's great because of its creator's conviction that to ignore injustice is to sanction it.", "The film is an outstanding achievement.", "It's a stunning achievement, a film that re-creates the Holocaust not as something abstract, but as felt knowledge.", "...a most credible and realistic film. [Full Review in Spnaish]", "Enough to give you hope for the future of American movies.", "Schindler's List is bearable when the characters keep the tension, but the film lapses when its epic drama and sentimentality take over. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Schindler's List, with its grave documentary thoroughness and moral complexity, rewrites film history. It is one of the cinema's finest achievements.", "It was (and remains) irreducibly [Spielberg's] masterpiece.", "Spielberg understands that that tension is a problem not just of filming the subject, but of the subject itself: that the tale of any one individual has to struggle to avoid being swamped by the sheer scale of horror.", "With seemingly effortless grace and skill, Schindler's List balances fear and exaltation, humor and horror, love and death. It evokes, superbly, a time of savagery and grief, and the inexplicable, stunning compassion that rises within and against it.", "It's an extraordinary work of vision and passion that raises even the gifted Spielberg to a new level of artistry. And like all great works, it elevates everyone who views it.", "Spielberg ultimately remains Spielberg, finding his enduring themes within Thomas Keneally's novel and giving them the full Spielberg treatment."], "rating": ["1", "4.0/4", "5/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "3/5", "", "5/5", "", "4/4", "4/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Matt Neal", "Brian D.
