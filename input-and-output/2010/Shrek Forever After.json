{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Long-settled into married life and fully domesticated, Shrek (Mike Myers) begins to long for the days when he felt like a real ogre. Duped into signing a contract with devious Rumpelstiltskin, he finds himself in an alternate version of Far Far Away, where ogres are hunted, Rumpelstiltskin rules, and he and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) have never met.

What charms it does have can't really compete with the charms it doesn't have.", "DreamWorks and the unlovable ogre lose the plot.", "Shrek's inspired mash-up of the world of fairy tales and contemporary pop culture is now yielding diminishing returns.", "Reveals an urge by the filmmakers to wipe the slate clean, as large an admission that the series is out of ideas as one could get. That said, all involved do try to make the most of it.", "...sweet and gentle, and the conclusion, while expected, carries a good deal of touching sentiment.", "It's sweet, mildly funny, and a pleasant enough farewell from these once beloved characters.
