{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Born into a family business of race cars, Speed Racer (Emile Hirsch) is one of the track's hot stars. Sitting at the wheel of his Mach 5, he consistently deflates the competition. When Speed turns down an offer from the head of Royalton Industries, he uncovers a secret. Powerful moguls fix the races to boost profits. Hoping to beat the executive, Speed enters the same arduous cross-country race that killed his brother.", "rating": "41", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "2h 15m", "director": "Lilly Wachowski, Lana Wachowski", "studio": "SilverPictures", "theater_date": "May 9, 2008", "dvd_date": "Apr 1, 2010", "box_office": "$43.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The instant the movie starts, viewers are introduced to a psychedelic world in which fast cars reign supreme and the laws of physics have long been lost.", "It is Ricci who shines most brightly here.", "Speed Racer has the extraordinary style down pat, and its sense of abstraction is what sells the vast race-fixing conspiracy lurking in the background of the plot.", "A misstep of epic proportions -- an overbearing mix of candy-coated visuals and an incoherent plot.", "Its main attraction is: It is pure movement, a plastic experiment that does not look like anything that has been done before. [Full Review in Spanish]", "A flawed experiment with a heart of gold.", "The action in Speed Racer is top notch in every sense, as though everything the Wachowskis worked on in the Matrix trilogy was simply a warm up.", "An excellent cast, story and visuals combine for an adrenaline-fueled experience. Go, Speed Racer!", "It seems less a commercial strategy by the Wachowskis as a philosophical one: to incorporate as many forms of communication and color-blind ethnicity as possible, much as they did with the Matrix pictures.", "Amid the overly earnest tone, (almost) squeaky-clean humor and familiar messages about teamwork and integrity is the rare film family that's as strong at the start as they are by the end.", "This is Wacky Races powered by Enzo Ferrari and designed by Andy Warhol - candy-coloured carnage with a turbo-charged engine.", "The filmic side effect of eating an entire bowl full of sugar, Speed Racer is designed entirely with one audience in mind, and despite it's best efforts it's not going to appeal to anyone else.", "What grounds the spectacle, pushing it beyond a two-hour ejaculation of sensation, is its yearning for innocence", "Fellow critics mercilessly denounced this dazzling, visually inventive adaptation; one of the ten best films of 2008", "Cut from car to driver to announcer to audience and over and over again, ad nauseam. Such pretty racing scenes, so little to actually see.", "The brothers swamp the fragile story and characters with such a deluge of CGI tricks and elaborate action sequences that it proves hard to care about the humans on screen.", "You have to be 12 to like it, and I have to say there is little or nothing here to remind us why we were all quite so excited about The Matrix.", "", "Twelve-year-old boys should be wowed, but for the rest of us, it will depend on your appetite for eye candy.", ""], "rating": ["6/10", "1.5/4", "", "F", "4.5/5", "2.5/4", "", "A-", "", "", "3/5", "7/10", "", "A-", "4/10", "", "2/5", "C+", "", "2.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "CJ Sheu", "Micheal Compton", "John Tones", "Matthew Lucas", "Emily Asher-Perrin", "Julie Washington", "Ray Pride", "William Goss", "Ali Gray", "Joshua Starnes", "Fernando F.
