With nothing to lose, the new couple decide to emigrate to the United States with their neighbor Scheitz (Clemens Scheitz), whose American nephew lives in rural Wisconsin.

[Full review in Spanish]", "In some perverse way Herzog would probably prefer to see his despised and rejected characters remain despised and rejected, because it's their abject misery alone that seems to affirm their humanity in his eyes.", "One surreal view after another, a sustained captivation", "The amazing and brilliant thing about Herzog is the pure poetry he creates in his films. Really, the man is a poet", "", "", "", "Every time I revisit it, it has a new gift for me.", "", "Among other things, Mr. Herzog visually dazzles us while he's pulling the rug from under our feet.", "For every cheap shot about rural America (and there are many), there's an answering scene that kicks you in the stomach with its brutal honesty.", "No description is necessary beyond the final line in the film: 'We've got a truck on fire. We have a man on the lift we're unable to find the switch to turn the lift off. We can't stop the dancing chicken.
