You know who you are.", "Long may they continue to walk in Ronnie James Dio's short but comforting shadow.", "Tenacious D and the Pick of Destiny is diverting and fun and a great treat for fans, but it's as forgettable as Chinese dinner at the nursing home.", "Little more than a set of sketches strung along a plotline that is gossamer light.", "May just win over the rockers of old and new...", "I enjoyed it, though as a casual fan who also dug the Tenacious D album and DVD, I don't know how it'll play for newcomers.", "While the flick has a few funny moments likely to make the general public laugh, at heart it's a Tenacious D tribute layered with asides and inside jokes scripted with the group's diehard fans in mind.", "Apart from the cameos, the movie limps along from one satiric rock song to another, with only the music to carry it.", "Being a Jack Black fan is mandatory for this zany, energetic and relentless buddy movie, rock opera and crass low-brow comedy which no doubt has more appeal with mood enhancers - a hyperactive dose of Jack Black in a self-indulgent rock fantasy.", "Clearly intended to be viewed through a haze of marijuana smoke, it'd be against the law for us to recommend this film.", "", "The narrative, not surprisingly, is really just an excuse to string together a series of comic and musical setpieces, some of which work better than others.", "", "Tenacious D's big screen outing is extremely patchy but the laughs just about compensate for all the dull, unamusing bits.", "When they weren't performing, I frequently lost the will to live.", "The film's as big and flawed as the band itself.
