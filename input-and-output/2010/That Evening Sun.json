{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Vowing not to die in a nursing home, Abner Meecham (Hal Holbrook) leaves the facility and returns to his Tennessee farm. There, an unpleasant surprise awaits him: Abner's son has leased the property to ne'er-do-well Lonzo Choat (Ray McKinnon) and his boorish family. Abner suspects that the Choats will not be able to afford the farm, and he moves into a shack to await their departure. Tensions escalate between Abner and Lonzo, each determined not to yield.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Scott Teems", "studio": "DogwoodEntertainment", "theater_date": "Nov 6, 2009", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$280.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Holbrook's steely performance makes the film worth seeing.", "Southern Gothic, the real deal, not imitation, with great roles for Hal Holbrook, Mia Wasikowska and Ray McKinnon", "With his bravura performance, vet actor Hal Holbrook elevates this modest indie rural drama considerably.", "Forget Up in the Air: That Evening Sun is truly a film for our times.", "Watching Holbrook, I was reminded again of how steady and valuable this man has been throughout his career.", "As lovely as it is to see the veteran actor Holbrook working his craft as the lead actor in this Southern-fried drama, it's not enough to lift the movie from its sodden melodramatic roots.", "Holbrook expertly carries the film.", "Throughout the film Holbrook does nothing to soften his potentially unlikable character and winds up earning respect, and even a little affection in the process.", "Audiences are fortunate to finally have the chance to see a fine example of how good an independent film can be.", "Whatever magic was in Riordan's books is not in this FX-larded lump of a film.", "A tough, borderline unpleasant movie that keeps us on edge and waiting for something awful to happen. It may be honest, but, like its protagonist, it isn't likable.", "There is a predictability to the story, but that's OK. The acting is superb, Holbrook in particular, making That Evening Sun an understated pleasure.", "If an older actor were looking for a great valedictory role, it would be tough to top Abner Meecham, and Holbrook, 83, makes the most of it.", "Generates nearly all of its goodwill from a smashing central performance by a long-established veteran.", "Giving one of the best performances of his career, veteran actor Hal Holbrook gracefully epitomizes the cantankerous curmudgeon in this richly complex human drama.", "Still worth watching because of the fine performances by the actors. Just beware, it is very grim and the two main characters really are very obnoxious.", "A good, simple film whose reach doesn't exceed its grasp; it feels a bit like an artificially constructed awards-grab flick, yes, but That Evening Sun has an easy, unforced sense of authenticity that takes it a long way.", "Seems best viewed as a carefully orchestrated character study about a strong-willed man with the dramatic fireworks seemingly slight in comparison.", "The 84 year old Hal Holbrook shows how it is done in this Oscar worthy tour-de-force performance.", "Holbrook is great as usual...Well-adapted from a William Gay short story by writer-director Scott Teems."], "rating": ["3/5", "3/4", "B", "4/5", "3.5/4", "2/5", "3.5/5", "3.5/5", "3/4", "2/5", "2.5/4", "4/5", "3/4", "3/4", "7/10", "B", "C+", "C+", "3.5/5", "B+"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Harris", "Roger Moore", "Emanuel Levy", "Rob Humanick", "Roger Ebert", "Marjorie Baumgarten", "Josh Bell", "Dan Lybarger", "Keith Cohen", "Jim Slotek", "Robert W.
