[Full Review in Spanish]", "While the mordant ruthlessness of the asides at the expense of big business intrigues, indiscretions and Christmas parties is compromised by a final sequence of quite awful sentimentality.", "It somehow manages to be both sardonic and warmhearted while observantly focusing on the romance...", "A black-hearted satire this smart, cutting, and hilarious is good even if it can't quite find a way out of its nihilism.", "Billy Wilder's narrative eloquence, its spectacular scenes, the fantastic soundtrack signed by Adolph Deutsch and the brilliance and charm of its two protagonists make it an absolute delight. [Full Review in Spanish]", "A screen gem that attained classic status in about as much time as it takes to comb one's hair.", "Savoury Shirley' Maclaine and savoury Jack Lemmon save the day, two sad comedians who never spell Pathos with a capital and make a good pair, credible and touching, pleasing rather than glamorous,", "All this is quite a load for a comedy, but where else has social comment ever been so effective? Wilder hones his points to a piercing edge...", "If it weren't for Lemmon's so affable execution of Wilder and I.A.L. Diamond's script, The Apartment could have been oppressively dark and cynical.", "Production and direction wise, Wilder sustains his usual excellence. But his story is controversial and I am not one of those who can quite see The Apartment as the great comedy-drama he evidently intended it to be.", "...despite all its cynicism, The Apartment still ends on a hopeful note...", "From such potentially edgy material Wilder and co-writer IAL Diamond sculpt an unforgettable romance.", "Wilder, a bilious and mercurial wit, here becomes a wide-screen master of time ...", "Despite some entertaining moments and a terrific performance by its lead, it's not a perfect film and does have some problems.", "{VIDEO ESSAY} Billy Wilder's classic Manhattan-based romantic comedy comes with a sly critique regarding 50's era corporate culture of rampant misogyny and unbridled ambition.", "When assessing his own work Billy Wilder described The Apartment as being the film with the fewest mistakes.
