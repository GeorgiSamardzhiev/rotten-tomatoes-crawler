It's a summer blockbuster with equal parts brain and brawn.", "The famous masked vigilante has never looked or felt more intense.", "With his smeared whiteface make-up and leering razor-slashed smile, Ledger's Joker is creepy enough to look at, but what he represents is even more chilling.", "The awards hype is warranted.", "The Dark Knight managed to capture something complex and instinctive about the \"war on terror\" era.", "A masterpiece. Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight is not only one of the greatest comic book movies you'll ever see, but also one of the best films of all-time.", "It seems almost cruel to take beloved child archetypes and turn them into projections for adult angst.", "Heath Ledger gives one of the best performances of the last twenty years. When you watch his take on the Joker, it's one of complete surprise and mystery. It's frightening with how chaotic and mischievous he makes him.", "Ledger's performance alone is good enough to make The Dark Knight a very good movie, but fortunately this is a film with even more than that -- making it the not just the best film of the summer, but one of the best films of the year.", "The Dark Knight represents a masterpiece in filmmaking as Christopher Nolan takes the Batman Begins sequel to an entirely new level.", "The definitive movie of its genre and the best Batman film to date", "Heath Ledger is great.", "The movie's a real neo-noir all right, wallowing in darkness, thrilled with how bad we are, and getting such a kick out of our impending doom it cheers you right up.", "Not just a perfect comic book movie, not just a perfect Batman movie, but darn-near a perfect movie, full stop.", "A film is only as good as its villain. By that standard, The Dark Knight achieves true greatness.", "The Dark Knight always ought to be played on the biggest screen possible, and played loud, like a Led Zepplin song. Director Christopher Nolans' skyscapes, the helicopter shots and views from the 200th floor, are IMAX at its best.", "It might not be the most fun superhero movie ever made, but it's certainly the most mature, complex and intriguing of them all. [Full review in Spanish]", "The Dark Knight may not supply a happy ending, but there is a feeling of exhilaration as Batman rides off from the pursuing cops, and the realization that this is another big step forward for comic book movies.", "The action sequences are like being injected with a shot of adrenalin straight into the heart.", "This may seem like faint praise, but about the highest compliment I can give Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight right now is to say that there were many long stretches during which I didn't even realize it was a superhero movie"], "rating": ["4.5/5", "7/10", "", "3.5/4", "", "5/5", "", "5/5", "A", "5/5", "3.5/4", "B+", "", "A+", "", "", "5/5", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "Jason Best", "Richard Propes", "Siddhant Adlakha", "Josh Wilding", "Felicia Feaster", "Paul McGuire Grimes", "Micheal Compton", "Danielle Solzman", "Matthew Lucas", "Rachel Wagner", "Eileen Jones", "Zaki Hasan", "Marcianne Miller", "Richard von Busack", "Sebastian Zavala Kahn", "Matthew Goudreau", "Kaleem Aftab", "Glenn Kenny"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Talk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IGN Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ComicBookMovie.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Charleston City Paper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KSTP-TV (St. Paul, MN)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Solzy at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The eXile", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Zaki&#39;s Corner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bold Life (Hendersonville, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Pacific Sun (San Rafael, CA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Me gusta el cine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Young Folks", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The National (UAE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MUBI"], "date": ["January 31, 2021", "November 28, 2020", "November 15, 2020", "September 5, 2020", "September 1, 2020", "February 15, 2020", "January 28, 2020", "November 21, 2019", "October 29, 2019", "September 22, 2019", "June 5, 2019", "April 15, 2019", "November 2, 2018", "November 2, 2018", "August 26, 2018", "August 23, 2018", "July 30, 2018", "July 19, 2018", "May 14, 2018", "December 13, 2017"]}}
