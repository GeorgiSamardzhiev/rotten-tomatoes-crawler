{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Disgraced financial reporter Mikael Blomkvist (Daniel Craig) finds a chance to redeem his honor after being hired by wealthy Swedish industrialist Henrik Vanger (Christopher Plummer) to solve the 40-year-old murder of Vanger's niece, Harriet. Vanger believes that Harriet was killed by a member of his own family. Eventually joining Blomkvist on his dangerous quest for the truth is Lisbeth Salander (Rooney Mara), an unusual but ingenious investigator whose fragile trust is not easily won.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 38m", "director": "David Fincher", "studio": "ScottRudinProductions,YellowBird", "theater_date": "Dec 20, 2011", "dvd_date": "Sep 3, 2013", "box_office": "$102.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["For this particular story, Fincher's style is just too sleek.", "David Fincher's 2011 adaptation of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO is both a quite good movie and a deeply frustrating one.", "Mara gives a compelling breakout performance as Lisbeth Salander, the goth punk cyber sleuth...", "For the most part, David Fincher's new adaptation is identical to the original film.", "An incredibly well done thriller.", "An inconsistent ride, but definitely one worth taking.", "Being maddening at all times, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo is a brutal, dark and visually stimulating film that, releasing a huge anxiety, is captivating by the way the sinister clings to the unexpected. [Full review in Spanish]", "Fincher has crafted a visually stunning and poetic take on Larsson's wonderful source material.", "Fincher's is a skilled, slick, and engrossing version of Larsson's book.", "The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo really is a stand out film of 2011. It's one of the strongest Dramas you can see this season. It isn't for the faint of heart though", "The material is tailor-made for Fincher, and, in many respects, it feels a summation of his work over the preceding 15 years.", "A twisty film that feels promising at first but then devolves into a sensational, lurid tale that rivals Silence of the Lambs for squirm-factor.", "Rooney Mara inhabits the movie's namesake Lisbeth Salander with such commitment and believability she captivates the audience and keeps our rapt attention for the slightly overlong 2 hours and 40 minutes. It is her movie.", "The final product is a film of stunning craft (if ungainly form) built around a profoundly flawed foundation that even moments of individual brilliance can't fully save.", "I was eager to see how an American version of this material would play out. Rather nicely, it turns out, thanks to the keen direction of David Fincher and a breakout performance from Rooney Mara.", "What I like most about this movie is the way the story unfolds. I actually like the deliberate, almost unhurried pace, but every moment is never without a sense of dread.", "Fincher, Zaillian and the cast keep the pace propulsive. There's never a sense that the film is stalling out; everything that happens holds our attention and increases our curiosity.", "Streamlining Larsson's clunky storytelling, Zaillan injects a welcome streak of humour into events, giving Craig - and the rest of the superb cast - a chance to be both funny and icily ominous.", "A mesmerizing thriller anchored by a brilliant, revelatory performance by Rooney Mara.", "When you watch the film, you'll understand immediately why people are obsessed with its story. Fincher's movie, far truer to the novel than the Swedish version, will be a treat for fans of Larsson's series."], "rating": ["8/10", "", "3.5/4", "6/10", "3.0/4", "B", "9/10", "", "", "A", "4/5", "3/5", "", "2.5/4", "", "4.5/5", "B+", "4/5", "9/10", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Marianna Neal", "Justin Harrison", "Tom Meek", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Brent McKnight", "Yasser Medina", "Ed Travis", "Felicia Feaster", "Julian Lytle", "PJ Nabarro", "David Harris", "Leslie Combemale", "Matthew Lucas", "Micheal Compton", "Ruth Maramis", "Abbie Bernstein", "Ivan Radford", "Johnny Gayzmonic", "Annalee Newitz"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Impression Blend", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spool", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cambridge Day", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Jesus", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Charleston City Paper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Ignorant Bliss", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">FlixChatter Film Blog", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Assignment X", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fanboys of the Universe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">io9.com"], "date": ["January 3, 2021", "December 29, 2020", "December 19, 2020", "November 30, 2020", "September 8, 2020", "July 11, 2020", "June 24, 2020", "March 31, 2020", "January 17, 2020", "January 11, 2020", "October 31, 2019", "October 24, 2019", "July 29, 2019", "June 8, 2019", "May 7, 2019", "March 18, 2019", "February 8, 2019", "December 6, 2018", "November 4, 2018", "May 23, 2018"]}}
