It's definitely bland and worthless.

As such, you can expect to hear from it come Oscar time.", "It is Bening who sears as a likeable jumble of contradictions... It's a masterclass - and reason enough to buy your ticket.", "A fantastic film, exuding charm, wit, love, insecurity and anguish.", "Together the performances mark the perfect recipe in a beautifully written story is both funny in the most surprising parts and touching when it needs to be.", "A certain smugness creeps into the corners of The Kids Are All Right. Morality doesn't have to mean Puritanism, but there is something of that here.", "A great story for our time.", "I want to high five the person who cast Benning and Moore as a couple. They're scenes are the most delicious parts of the film.", "We're shown real life problems in a fictional story that gives us real life solutions. Bravo Lisa, your film is more than all right.", "Bening hoists this heavy-handed dramedy high with a burst of superhuman strength. And all you can do is sit in awe.", "A twist on the traditional family drama, where every character has depth and deserves redemption.", "The dialog seems like it was pulled from a magazine full of bad liberal clich\u00e9s. It feels as if people who used to be progressives, but want people to think they still are wrote this movie.", "This is very tricky material to parse, mainly because the movie is telling us one thing in dialogue and showing us quite another visually.", "What it lacks in grandstanding and pandering to the 'issues', this film more than makes up for with its great story, rounded characters and genuine sense of fun."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "1.5/4", "", "B", "A-", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "", "A", "", "", "", "", "A-", "4/4", "C", "", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Federico Furzan", "Brian D.
