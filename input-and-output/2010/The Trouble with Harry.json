{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When a local man's corpse appears on a nearby hillside, no one is quite sure what happened to him. Many of the town's residents secretly wonder if they are responsible, including the man's ex-wife, Jennifer (Shirley MacLaine), and Capt. Albert Wiles (Edmund Gwenn), a retired seaman who was hunting in the woods where the body was found. As the no-nonsense sheriff (Royal Dano) gets involved and local artist Sam Marlowe (John Forsythe) offers his help, the community slowly unravels the mystery.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "Alfred Hitchcock", "studio": "ParamountPictures,AlfredJ.HitchcockProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 8, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It doesn't come off because even the little touches are done badly.", "Hitchcock is reluctant to follow the subversive premises of the story through to their outrageous logical conclusion.", "Sprightly is the word for Hitchcock's direction; neither moral nor gruesome, neither childish nor yet quite adult, neither in the world nor quite outside it, it gives the impression of taking you straight into a peculiarly vivid dream.", "Alfred Hitchcock's 1955 comedy has long been overshadowed by the masterworks that surround it, but it's a wonderful, fanciful film, the most optimistic movie he ever made -- a fairy tale among nightmares.", "The acting is perfection, with MacLaine (in her debut) quite wonderful, and Hitchcock was mighty proud of this adaptation of Jack Trevor Story's novel, always naming it among his personal favourites.", "Assimilating the black humours of the comedie noire into the gentler comedy of village eccentricity, Hitchcock and his scriptwriter, John Michael Hayes, have concocted an entertainment insidious in its charm.", "The film, a radical departure for the director, is one of his most forgotten, and it's also one of his best, a night-black portrait of small-town New England nonchalance and charm.", "One of the absolute funniest movies of the 1950s, not least because it is perhaps the most puckish.", "A spirited irreverence about the power of death pervades. Think of this as a relief valve compared to most of Hitchcock's other films.", "This is a blithe little comedy, produced and directed with affection by Alfred Hitchcock, about a bothersome corpse that just can't stay buried.", "I love it.
