{"metadata": {"synopsis": "James Cameron's \"Titanic\" is an epic, action-packed romance set against the ill-fated maiden voyage of the R.M.S. Titanic; the pride and joy of the White Star Line and, at the time, the largest moving object ever built. She was the most luxurious liner of her era -- the \"ship of dreams\" -- which ultimately carried over 1,500 people to their death in the ice cold waters of the North Atlantic in the early hours of April 15, 1912.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "3h 15m", "director": "James Cameron", "studio": "20thCenturyFox,LightstormEntertainment,ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "Dec 19, 1997", "dvd_date": "Jun 1, 2014", "box_office": "$656.5K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It might be best perhaps to describe Titanic as a sort of lowest common denominator. The film contains certain minimums necessary to draw an audience ... but its very blandness ... accounts for its great success.", "Stirring music and seamless special effects add to the thrills - it's just a shame it takes so long to get to that point.", "For all the sluggish script and the enormous weight of the special effects, this movie behemoth still has the power to shake us rigid and and touch the soul.", "[The ending] is a masterpiece of popcorn tragedy: not deep, not sophisticated, barely even credible, but gut-clutching for those of us who have already lost the sensible use of our stomachs, as we would in any worthwhile fairground ride.", "It's the kind of movie that just doesn't come along that often.", "In recent years I've come around to thinking that a more nuanced version of the tale with better-rounded characters wouldn't resonate as powerfully as Cameron's shamelessly bold, sometimes silly strokes.", "See Titanic, then, for its success as an outrageous visual stunt -- a marvel of cinematic (and computer) sleight-of-hand. But don't go with any illusions that this soap opera on water is anything but a cartoon melodrama with fairy-tale leads.", "The movie is a ride, and not without the odd moment of corniness. But it's also about freedom and flight, bondage and stagnation. And most fittingly, as a memorial itself, it's about memory and the act of remembering.", "No meager disaster movie, greased by generic formula and goosed by big-bucks technology... Titanic is one big, bruising movie that will appeal on different levels to different audiences.", "Titanic has deservedly cemented its place as one of the greatest movies of all time, as it manages to capture the wretchedness of historical tragedy while also skilfully enrapturing us with the dedication shown by one person to another...", "The dialogue may be unspeakable, but the film remains unsinkable.", "Cameron's aim was to set the most intimate love story possible against one of the century's biggest tragedies, and he very nearly pulls it off. DiCaprio has a captivating presence in a role that might have been written for a young Clark Gable.", "What I can tell you, risking puns, is that it swept me off my feet almost from the get-go, a grand epic romance-disaster that reminded me, in the middle of my overstuffed-with-movies life, of what we mean when we talk about the power of cinema.", "Sure, 'Titanic' may be corny, clumsy, and obvious-but the sincerity of its emotions and the power of its spectacle endure.", "Cameron has devised a tender love story between Kate Winslet and Leonardo DiCaprio that serves as the main focus of Titanic's storyline, and it works beautifully.", "If computer-generated special effects have overpowered human-generated drama, Cameron seizes that dangerously cold technology and recasts it as dream and delirium, profoundly human in its sources and longings.", "The execution is state-of-the-art and breathtaking. Titanic offers the full compass of courage and cowardice, and it stands as an achievement that truly is a night to remember at the movies.", "Titanic provides an absorbing blend of historical fact and old-fashioned Hollywood tearjerking.", "Titanic is indeed a ship of dreams. Climb aboard and bon voyage.", "DiCaprio and Winslet both deliver star-making performances."], "rating": ["", "7/10", "", "", "A", "", "2.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "4/4", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Mike Massie", "Geoff Brown", "Nigel Andrews", "Rachel Wagner", "Sean Burns", "David Baron", "Quentin Curtis", "Duane Byrge", "Hannah Ryan", "Matthew Sweet", "Jack Mathews", "Alissa Wilkinson", "Jason Bailey", "Paul Tatara", "Dave Kehr", "Desmond Ryan", "Maria Schneider", "Jay Boyar", "Leah Rozen"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Financial Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rachel&#39;s Reviews (YouTube)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The ARTery", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times-Picayune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen Queens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent on Sunday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Vox", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Vice", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNN.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine"], "date": ["February 12, 2021", "September 25, 2020", "February 6, 2020", "February 6, 2020", "June 28, 2019", "June 20, 2019", "February 21, 2019", "February 6, 2019", "December 26, 2018", "August 24, 2018", "March 2, 2018", "January 3, 2018", "December 19, 2017", "December 15, 2017", "February 25, 2014", "February 25, 2014", "February 25, 2014", "February 25, 2014", "February 25, 2014", "February 25, 2014"]}}
