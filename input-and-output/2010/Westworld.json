{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Westworld is a futuristic theme park where paying guests can pretend to be gunslingers in an artificial Wild West populated by androids. After paying a sizable entrance fee, Blane (James Brolin) and Martin (Richard Benjamin) are determined to unwind by hitting the saloons and shooting off their guns. But when the system goes haywire and Blane is killed in a duel with a robotic gunslinger (Yul Brynner), Martin's escapist fantasy suddenly takes on a grim reality.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Western", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Michael Crichton", "studio": "MetroGoldwynMayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 7, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It just felt like a cheesy 70s Western with like a sci-fi twist, but it was enjoyable, it was fun to see where the show originated.", "It is never pretentious and concentrates more on its visceral than sociological effect.

[Full review in Spanish]", "Some cheesy moments (is there a '70s movie that escaped them?) date the film, but Westworld is a fun futuristic thriller.", "The central conceit is so flimsy that it's only possible to take it seriously at all by treating it as a metaphor. Which, fortunately, can be done pretty easily,", "Classic Man versus Machine adventure is funny but violent.", "There is some satire here - the devouring tourist becoming prey - but Crichton just lets the joke sit there, heavy on the screen.", "The idea exceeds the execution", "Its serio-comedy is intellegently presented.", "classic in a boring sort of a way", "Robot western....cool.", "Brynner is very good, his austere presence and unflinching intent making him seem indestructible.", "Combines solid entertainment, chilling topicality, and superbly intelligent serio-comic story values.", "Priceless sci-fi schlock.", "The film is 83 minutes long and basically puts forward its premise, twists the plot and then ends before the concepts become exhausted.", "Great robotic performance by Yul Brenner.", "", "Great stuff.", "Good cheesy old sci-fi yarn.", "Verso \"primitiva\" de Jurassic Park, parte de uma premissa interessante, mas jamais cria tenso suficiente no terceiro ato - apesar da boa presena de Brynner."], "rating": ["", "", "", "B", "6/10", "3/5", "2/4", "", "B", "2.5/4", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "4/5", "6/10", "2/5", "", "3/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Steph Cozza", "Dick Lochte", "Mikel Zorrilla", "James Plath", "Tim Brayton", "Renee Schonfeld", "Josh Larsen", "Fernando F.
