{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Tired of their humdrum lives, some middle-aged friends (Tim Allen, John Travolta, Martin Lawrence) decide to temporarily ditch their responsibilities and take a motorcycle trip. The freedom of the open road holds many surprises for the group, including an encounter with the Del Fuegos, a hardcore gang, who take a dim view of the novice bikers.", "rating": "14", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "Walt Becker", "studio": "TouchstonePictures,Tollin/RobbinsProductions", "theater_date": "Mar 2, 2007", "dvd_date": "Nov 23, 2015", "box_office": "$168.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A disastrous, problem-laden melodrama that falls into the timeworn trap of stark seriousness injected into general levity.", "A sad, pathetic attempt at humor -- with a slew of talented names wasted in a premise that should never have gotten the green light.", "Ripe with laughter, gags, obvious ad-libbing and a free-wheeling sense of lensing that befits the open road ride of the Wild Hogs, [Walt] Becker does another admirable job despite the film's shortcomings.", "When the film isn't trading on an endless parade of gay jokes, it's focusing on an unfunny, unoriginal subplot in which the group must face off with a gang of biker bad guys.", "Instead of opening up the throttle, Hogs ends up idling and spreading exhaust.", "Becker is handy with a camera and totally knows where the film's bread is buttered, focusing all his energy and attention on his four stars.", "I can only assume a bike wreck is much more gruesome than a car accident. Luckily, I have never seen one, but after watching Wild Hogs, I can imagine.", "No.", "Perhaps I was in a good mood, perhaps my expectations were so rock bottom, but hell, I didn't hate it...", "Disneyfied Easy Rider for the suburban set.", "Fluff aimed at conservative Middle America, a cynical go-with-the-demographic-trends movie that's shallow and stupid, but featuring big names guaranteeing box office success.", "This isn't a movie with any meaningful insights to share about the heartfelt concerns of the over-forty set, but is rather an ill-conceived, \"coming-of-age\" style misadventure which could just as easily have revolved around some recent high school grads.", "Truly awful, monumentally inept, wholly unwatchable.", "I'm not sure how well it speaks of a comedy if the funniest scenes come during the closing credits.", "At one point, Tim Allen proclaims: 'I'm lame. I'm just lame -- admit it, I'm lame.' Tim, you're preaching to the choir.", "If it's a laugh you're after, you have a better shot at getting one by reading a Bazooka Joe wrapper. At least you get a piece of gum with that.", "The characters are not consistent and behave crazily in order to advance what little plot there is.", "This could have been a City Slickers on cycles. But it's an incredibly lazy movie, from the on-the-nose casting to the soundtrack ('70s vintage road rock) to the script to the scouting of locations.", "There are a couple of genuinely funny sight gags, but most of the roadside attractions of Wild Hogs are either boring or outright annoying.", "If you can imagine City Slickers with bikes instead of horses and without the wit, the likable performances and Jack Palance, then you have a pretty good idea of what this movie is like."], "rating": ["4/10", "", "2/5", "", "2/4", "3/5", "2/10", "", "2/4", "2/5", "5", "1/4", "1/5", "4/10", "2/4", "0.5/5", "C", "C", "2/4", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Micheal Compton", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Megan Basham", "Tom Meek", "Kit Bowen", "Jeff Bayer", "Garth Franklin", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Sandie Angulo Chen", "Brian Webster", "Kam Williams", "David Cornelius", "John J.
