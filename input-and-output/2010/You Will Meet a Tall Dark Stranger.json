{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Two married couples find only trouble and heartache as their complicated lives unfold. After 40 years of marriage, Alfie leaves his wife to pursue what he thinks is happiness with a call girl. His wife, Helena, reeling from abandonment, decides to follow the advice of a psychic. Sally, the daughter of Alfie and Helena, is unhappy in her marriage and develops a crush on her boss, while her husband, Roy, falls for a woman engaged to be married.", "rating": "46", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts/Romance", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Woody Allen", "studio": "VersatilCinema,Dippermouth,GravierProductions,MediaproPictures", "theater_date": "Sep 22, 2010", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2015", "box_office": "$3.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The film's pessimistic view of life and relationships probably won't win the director any new fans, but the intricate, darkly ironic plot should keep the Allen faithful intrigued.", "Light, fun, entertaining.", "It doesn't add up to much, but there's some pleasure in watching the performances-a septet ensemble that ticks along to the music of misplaced romance.", "Rather uninspired and insubstantial, but entirely watchable.", "Allen has forgotten how to write like people talk, and the muted yellows of upper-class London are as boring as the script, which contains a Viagra joke, in 2010.", "I'm fighting the urge to just cut-and-paste from my older reviews of Allen's late-career output, as that seems to be how he writes his screenplays these days.", "Woody at his weakest.", "It's one of Allen's lesser films yet, as is so often the case with his B-material, it still features terrific performances...and a cluster of truth-nailing scenes that are better than what you typically find in major releases.", "You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger is the amnesiac relative of Allen's body of work. It's wearing the fleshy mask of all that you love; but conducts itself with an abrasive and frightened detachment.", "Allen's mixed experiences with London stand in sharp contrast with his love affair with the French capital (the setting for last year's return to form, Midnight in Paris).", "Like a second hand clothes shop, it is comfortable rather than exciting, predictable rather than refreshing, even though it boasts a great cast who believe in their master, Woody Allen", "It may not be Allen's best work, but this flutter and change of hearts is easy to watch and enjoy as wishes and dreams play their tug of war", "The cast is the main draw here, but it's also the movie's biggest problem. Hopkins and Jones are excellent, and a greater focus on that couple might well have resulted in a much better film.", "How many times do you want to watch the same Woody Allen movie? What's your tolerance threshold for repeat visits back to his couch?", "Maybe the next one will be a return to form for the living legend, and hey, at the rate Allen is churning them out, one of them has to be good, right?", "Elaborately plotted, perfunctorily directed, unevenly acted and short on verbal wit.", "", "Another wretched Woody Allen release gives yet another round of Hollywood actors the chance to tick him off their legends-to-work-with lists without giving us much to enjoy in the process...", "Allen has said he makes films as they offer him a distraction, and he has created just that: An enjoyable but instantly forgettable distraction.", "This is no Manhattan or Annie Hall, and while it's true Woody Allen isn't as good as he used to be, neither is anyone else."], "rating": ["", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "1.5/4", "3/5", "2/5", "3/5", "", "", "3/5", "1/5", "1/5", "", "3.5/5", "1/5", "3/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Jason Best", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Brian D.
