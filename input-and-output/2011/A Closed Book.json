Yet it's also severely lacking in the fundamentals.", "A Closed Book is directed by Raoul Ruiz, a \"revered member of the European avant-garde\" who decided to tackle \"the Anglo-Saxon tradition\" - with execrable results.", "Eccentric Chilean director Raoul Ruiz has rifled through the Hammer bag of horror tricks and come up with a relentlessly silly, oddly diverting yarn.", "The film feels less like a thriller than an aesthete's tease, and one with a disappointingly stiff, Europuddingy flavour.", "Watching this two-hander feels very much like sitting through a play and although it's a well-acted one, A Closed Book's amateur charms may be lost on moviegoers expecting a lot more flash for their cash.", "It's all rather mannered and the final denouement is disappointingly banal.", "The cat-and-mouse plot fizzles out long before its lacklustre finale, which is a pity as Conti is watchable in an all-too-rare starring role.", "A Closed Book should be locked, shut in a safe, then thrown into the sea so it is never seen again.", "Events gradually turn Gothic, with things going bump in the night, as they often do in films containing blind characters or set in country houses, so here the fun is doubled, and it all culminates in a final twist that has to be seen to be disbelieved.", "The plot is stagey, and the denouement ridiculous, but its sheer unlikeliness is what also keeps you hanging in there.", "What? Who? And, most pertinently, why? The greatest mystery of this gloriously preposterous B-movie psychodrama is the casting.", "One of those enjoyably awful films that's actually quite good fun providing you don't take it remotely seriously.
