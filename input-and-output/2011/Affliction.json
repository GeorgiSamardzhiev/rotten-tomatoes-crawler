{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In a small New Hampshire town, washed-up cop Wade Whitehouse (Nick Nolte) has a troubled past, an abusive father (James Coburn), the contempt of his ex-wife (Mary Beth Hurt) and an unimpressive streak as a lawman. When hunting guide Jack Hewitt (Jim True) reports a businessman's accidental death during a hunting trip, Wade believes he has a chance to turn around his life, if he can prove it was murder. Increasingly obsessed, Wade begins to lose his composure during the investigation.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Paul Schrader", "studio": "JVCEntertainment,LargoEntertainment", "theater_date": "Jan 15, 1999", "dvd_date": "Oct 6, 2016", "box_office": "$6.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There are too many of these men in life, and not enough films that tell their sad tales.
