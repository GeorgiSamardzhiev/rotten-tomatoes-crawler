{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When he is not planning for his upcoming stage musical or working on his Hollywood film, choreographer/director Joe Gideon (Roy Scheider) is popping pills and sleeping with a seemingly endless line of women. The physical and mental stress begins to take a toll on the ragged perfectionist. Soon, he must decide whether or not his non-stop work schedule and hedonistic lifestyle are worth risking his life. The film is a semi-autobiographical tale written and directed by the legendary Bob Fosse.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 3m", "director": "Bob Fosse", "studio": "ColumbiaPictures,TwentiethCenturyFox", "theater_date": "Jan 1, 1979", "dvd_date": "Aug 3, 2004", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A tour de force self-portrait by the brilliant writer-director-choreographer Bob Fosse, as seamlessly impersonated in a career-peak turn from Roy Scheider.", "It's the opposite of a vanity project.", "The music lacks personality and it never shines too bright. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Allows us to go deeper inside a movie that was so much more than just another musical, it is a window into the soul of an artist.", "Bob Fosse's half-confession about what a jerk he was to the women in his life...", "This is a plausible milestone in the evolution of the Hollywood film, a quivering, pulsating, dynamic, excessive and flawed film that wears its alienation proudly where its heart should be.", "The most beautifully fluid of Fosse and Heim's collaborations, it's the raucous fantasia of a spectacularly horny man who can't stop drinking, drugging and screwing around, even when he's at death's door.", "By the time the film is over, the movie has degenerated with a jaundiced vengeance. Fosse's sour, grandstanding cynicism imposed an intolerable burden of self-pity on his talent, our compassion and the tradition of the backstage musical.", "Fosse fans, Broadway fans, and those fascinated with film will find quite a lot to admire, however, those expecting a fun musical romp will need to inquire elsewhere and at some other time and place.", "All That Jazz is one of the most self-indulgent movies ever made-but blessedly so.", "This film was made in 1979 but nothing since then in film musicals has come even close.", "...were it not for the steady, understated presence of Roy Scheider as Fosse stand-in Joe Gideon, the whole thing might well do up in a burst of spontaneous combustion, spraying sequins and feather boas in all directions.", "All That Jazz is a speed freak of a movie, flying by at breakneck pace, then screeching to a halt so the protagonist can indulge in some serious ruminations on death", "Savagely witty on backstage life and audaciously edited.", "Though Scheider is a wry, sensitive actor, he soon gets lost in the vulgar theatrics.", "The dancing is frenzied, the dialogue piercing, the photography superb, and the acting first-rate, with non-showman Scheider an illustrious example of casting against type.", "Almost every scene is excruciating (and a few are appalling), yet the film stirs an obscene fascination with its rapid, speed-freak cutting and passionate psychological striptease.", "A self-important, egomaniacal, wonderfully choreographed, often compelling film which portrays the energetic life, and preoccupation with death, of a director-choreographer.", "Ain't Jazz dance grand when you're dyin' ?", ""], "rating": ["", "", "", "4/4", "3/4", "", "", "", "8/10", "4.5/5", "4.5/5", "8/10", "8", "5/5", "", "3/4", "", "", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Lamble", "Gena Radcliffe", "Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos", "Matthew Lucas", "Josh Larsen", "Bruce McCabe", "Sean Burns", "Gary Arnold", "J.C.
