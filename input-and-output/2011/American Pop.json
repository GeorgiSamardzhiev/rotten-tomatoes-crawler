{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This animated trek across the musical landscape of the 20th century begins with young immigrant Zalmie (Jeffrey Lippa) arriving in New York City. He's addicted to show business, but an accident ruins his voice. He marries a stripper (Lisa Jane Persky) and their son, Benny (Richard Singer), becomes a jazz pianist. Although Benny is killed in World War II, his son, Tony (Ron Thompson), goes on to great success as a songwriter during the '60s, as does Tony's son, Pete (also Thompson), in the '80s.", "rating": "61", "genre": "Animation/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Ralph Bakshi", "studio": "Columbia", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 20, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Although the plot, like the music itself, can be somewhat too strident, the animation is remarkably successful in delineating the sad geography of the human body and the massive backgrounds of American cities.", "This is a film that grandly overreaches, attempting to condense a century's worth of triumph and tragedy into ninety minutes.
