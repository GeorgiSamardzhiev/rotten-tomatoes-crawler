{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After his mother dies, Oliver (Ewan McGregor) is stunned when his father, Hal (Christopher Plummer), recently diagnosed with terminal cancer, comes out of the closet. When Hal passes away a few years later, Oliver grows depressed, struggling with his failing career as an artist while constantly remembering his childhood and time spent with his dad. Oliver's loneliness is eased when he meets actress Anna (M\u00e9lanie Laurent), but their relationship is threatened by their mutual fear of commitment.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Mike Mills", "studio": "Parts&amp;Labor", "theater_date": "Jun 3, 2011", "dvd_date": "Feb 12, 2014", "box_office": "$5.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Topping off the tender tale is the cutest on-screen dog since Benji who provides unique insight into Oliver's emotional maturation.", "At the very least, an Independent Spirit Award nomination should be assured here as Plummer embodies soulfulness and celebration and remarkable humanity all at once.", "Beginners manages to charm despite a tendency toward art-house cuddliness.", "The result is a ton of laughter, tears, a surprising out-of-character performance by Goran Visnjic as Plummer's boyfriend, and an adorable canine with more personality than most people.", "McGregor and Laurent are outstanding.", "It's OK, I suppose, and quite sweet. But I couldn't love it for proper, probably because its characters are always more interested in themselves than we are in them, plus it's just too self-consciously tricksy.", "Beginners wants to say something profound about the difficulties of committing to love, but Hal and Oliver are the only characters who come across as full-fledged people.", "Moving and intelligent, with a truly great cast.", "Every part of the film fits together perfectly, be it the acting, characters, story, direction; they're all perfect.", "... at its core, Beginners is about finding happiness, even at the end.", "Plummer will take your breath away. As a man who learns it's never to late to fall in love (or lust), he may have wrapped up a best supporting Oscar.", "\"Beginners\" ultimately becomes so deeply resonant that you should pack some Kleenexes just in case.", "Mills needs to look up from the lint that's collected in his navel.", "Mike Mills treats love and loss with a disarming tenderness and a refusal of sentimentality that make Beginners, his second feature, something of an anomaly among male identity flicks. What a finely wrought, wryly funny, transcendently sad movie this is.", "It understands death better than it understands life; it understands memories more than it understands what to learn from them.", "Beginners, beyond its pervasive atmosphere of melancholy and loss, suffers from a little self-indulgence. It's your typical indie drama.", "Plummer, who won an Oscar for this, is that rare actor lucky enough to manage half a century of undiminished dash and elan on screen.", "Life begins at death. A funny, engaging romantic dramedy about never being too late to find happiness.", "Una historia profundamente humana en la que el director no teme escarbar en sus propios fantasmas.
