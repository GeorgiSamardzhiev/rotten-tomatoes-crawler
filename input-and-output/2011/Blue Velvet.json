[Full Review in Spanish]", "This may not be the purely intuitive, spiritual-meaning-through-form filmmaking of the mature Lynch, but it is pretty great cinema.", "Blue Velvet captures Lynch's fixation on the contrast between purity and depravity, all while crisscrossing the line between idyllic surfaces and their vile underbellies.", "Unlike most great movies, this one loses some of its power with each subsequent viewing.", "To an average moviegoer unaware of Lynch's work, the open scene may allude Blue Velvet is going to be a peaceful movie. But this is Lynch's world, so buckle up because shit is about to get weird.", "Blue Velvet takes place in a space where violence is always possible, never far; its threat is debilitating to the progression of everything from innocence to love.", "Blue Velvet has the air of a movie that flows out of the artist's obsessions the way silk comes from the worm... It shows what a brilliant filmmaker can do by nurturing his unconscious, by digging through mere cleverness to the sap of life.", "David Lynch looks behind the smiling faces and stucco houses of small town America and finds a shadow world of pure evil in Blue Velvet.", "Every viewing yields new insights. A berserko modern classic.", "The film releases a toxic narcosis of fear.", "Isabella Rossellini's singer Dorothy is a heart-rending open wound, Dennis Hopper's Frank Booth one of cinema's great nutjobs, and Lynch's control a thing of nightmarish beauty.", "You can't laugh this movie off. It won't let you.", "Gestures: ears; hands; bared necks; eyes, held still and fearful. Just within his grasp. Not clutching, not crushing, not brushing, not bruising. Just imminent.", "Has lost very little of its juice or shock in three decades.", "Three decades after its initial release, David Lynch's Blue Velvet has lost none of its power to derange, terrify, and exhilarate.", "The charged erotic atmosphere makes the film something of a hallucination, but Lynch's humor keeps breaking through, too.", "Shocking, visionary, rapturously controlled, its images of innocence and a dark, bruising sexuality drop straight into our unconscious where they rest like depth charges.", "[A] powerful, mesmerizing thriller, a masterful exercise in controlling an audience`s attention."], "rating": ["9/10", "", "", "4/5", "", "3/4", "", "5/5", "", "", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "", "5/5", "", "", "", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Derek Malcolm", "Octavi Marti", "Tim Brayton", "Josh Goller", "Matt Brunson", "Chase Whale", "C.H.
