It's that it's not a Pixar film.", "Start your engines! You're in for the adventure of your life with Cars 2.", "Yes, the movie has some weak spots. A little long, a little light on story, and, gratefully, heavy on visuals...but I say, with Pixar, do we always need missing parents and tearjerking, with tissues always an arm's reach away?", "I defy anyone to tell me with a straight face that this is anywhere near as awful as 2011's other family hits, Zookeeper and Mr. Popper's Penguins. Case closed.", "The trouble with stuffing too much into a film quickly becomes evident in Cars 2, as the plotlines tumble and collide with each other creating, mostly, cacophony.", "The animation... alone is good enough for it worth a watch.", "There's a fine line between being healthily assertive in joining the conversation and being rude, however unintentionally. Mater is on the wrong side of that line, which gives Cars 2 a bit of a strange message.", "There's much to look at, but little to follow.", "Cars 2 suffers from a charmless and immoderately talky storyline that hikes up the thrills but forgets the widespread appeal of its far superior contemporaries.", "The animation whizzes at Pixar shift from weightier fare to madcap action in \"Cars 2,\" a zippy, multitrack adventure custom built for gearheads, racing fans and little boys.", "If you're interested in seeing wonderful landscapes created by the magic of digital animation and some of the most colorful characters never created in the automotive industry world, this is just the movie for you... [Full review in Spanish]", "The problems start and end with the uninspired, witless and convoluted script.", "To its credit, Cars 2, despite its over-busy plot and constant action, certainly isn't, well, on automatic. But the secret agent schemes do get confusing.", "A fairly disastrous sequel...", "Undoubtedly flawed, this animated film is still (barely) worth seeing.", "Minor Pixar, but it would be a major film were it made by just about anyone else. I, for one, will not get greedy.", "Unlike the duller than duller \"Cars,\" this is better than the toys they sell along with it.", "Despite a more interesting plot, Cars 2 still leans on a number of problems established in the first film -- specifically leading men, Lightning McQueen and Mater.", ""], "rating": ["7/10", "2.5/4", "", "", "3/4", "2/5", "C", "B-", "2/5", "2/5", "3/4", "3/5", "C-", "", "2/4", "3.0/5", "B+", "3/4", "2.5/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Leslie Combemale", "Matt Brunson", "Shubhra Gupta", "Rachel Wagner", "Abbie Bernstein", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Edward Frost", "Brandy McDonnell", "Laura Hiros", "Kiko Martinez", "Eleanor Ringel Cater", "David Nusair", "John Hanlon", "Will Leitch", "Roger Moore", "Ben Kendrick", "Scott A.
