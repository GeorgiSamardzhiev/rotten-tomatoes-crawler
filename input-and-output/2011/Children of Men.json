The difficulty is that the film's various elements do not fully cohere.", "As always, Michael Caine manages to steal every scene he's in with effortless, offbeat comedic charm.", "Cuaron was able to infuse every moment with the importance of what is at stake.", "Children of Men is concentrated cinema, wrought, focused, emblematic.... Cuar\u00f3n [is] equally concerned with the survival of richly detailed cinema as the fraught voyage of his encircled, besieged characters.", "This is one movie that will have a lasting impact even if you are forced to watch it on a ten-inch black and white Zenith.", "A rare kind of film -- thought-provoking, but full of intense action scenes.", "The final 25 minutes is truly filmmaking at its absolute best.", "You find yourself reaching for that terribly over-used and abused superlative: masterpiece.", "If any film is to define the state of American cinema in \"the aughts,\" let it be Children of Men.", "It is simultaneously soul-crushing and spirit-lifting. Watching twelve years after its release, the potent themes of immigration, border control, and seeking humanity in others means Children of Men remains more timely than ever.", "Beautifully directed and magnificently crafted, it's a wrenching thriller in a grimy world of industrial decay, a distorted mirror of today in a palette of cement dust.", "Enjoy it for its story, enjoy it for its entertainment value, and enjoy it for its intelligence. Just watch it.", "The future is a touchable, understandable place, the physical sensations of which we already know in our hearts and guts, hence its draw to people who're looking ahead with no small amount of discomfort.", "[Children of Men] is terribly exciting.", "Cuar\u00f3n is implementing a verisimilitude that both matches the film's edge-of-your-seat escalations and demonstrates a new understanding of blockbuster realism.", "Children of Men founders in its latter moments -- not a lot, but enough. Its failure is less one of plot than of something deeper, a composing idea to undergird the plot.", "A film that has much to recommend it, not least the proof it offers, as if any more were needed, that Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n is one of the most visually inspired directors working today.", "Here is your post-holiday depression pill: Children of Men. Not to relieve depression. To cause it.", "Children of Men is so boldly told, so thought out, so infused with the joy of filmmaking, that it's absolutely exhilarating. It's one of the best movies of the past year.", "Alfonso Cuaron stages some terrific set-pieces, and the production designers deserve credit for making London in 2027 look like the grunge capital of the world, ie, like now, only more so. One small problem: I didn't believe any of it."], "rating": ["", "9/10", "", "1", "", "B", "5/5", "1", "4/4", "4/5", "", "1", "", "", "", "", "", "2/4", "4/4", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Mike Massie", "Allen Almachar", "Ray Pride", "Kathi Maio", "Micheal Compton", "Karl Delossantos", "Grant Watson", "Matthew Lucas", "Millicent Thomas", "Sean Axmaker", "Courtney Button", "Dorothy Woodend", "Annie Wagner", "Michael Joshua Rowin", "Christopher Orr", "Ryan Gilbey", "David Elliott", "Matt Soergel", "Anthony Quinn"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newcity", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Smash Cut Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fiction Machine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen Queens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Stream on Demand", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Starburst", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Tyee (British Columbia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Stranger (Seattle, WA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Stop Smiling", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Atlantic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Statesman", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Diego Union-Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Florida Times-Union", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)"], "date": ["February 14, 2021", "November 18, 2020", "August 6, 2020", "May 17, 2020", "February 28, 2020", "November 21, 2019", "August 5, 2019", "June 27, 2019", "June 6, 2019", "November 10, 2018", "November 3, 2018", "October 30, 2018", "August 23, 2017", "August 23, 2017", "April 1, 2015", "April 1, 2015", "April 1, 2015", "April 1, 2015", "April 1, 2015", "April 1, 2015"]}}
