{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this classic story of love and devotion set against the backdrop of the American Civil War, a wounded Confederate soldier named W.P. Inman (Jude Law) deserts his unit and travels across the South, aiming to return to his young wife, Ada (Nicole Kidman), who he left behind to tend their farm. As Inman makes his perilous journey home, Ada struggles to keep their home intact with the assistance of Ruby (Ren\u00e9e Zellweger), a mysterious drifter sent to help her by a kindly neighbor.", "rating": "71", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 35m", "director": "Anthony Minghella", "studio": "Cattleya,MiramaxFilms,BonaFideProductions,MirageEnterprises", "theater_date": "Dec 25, 2003", "dvd_date": "Aug 26, 2016", "box_office": "$95.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Minghella fans will be happy.", "While it may not be the best film of the year, it is still a solid effort worthy of most of its pre-release hype.", "While there are great performances from the likes of Zellwegger, Baker and Portman, and top of the line production values from Seale, Murch and Ferretti, [Cold Mountain] as a whole is forgettable.", "Benefits greatly from the presence of Renee Zellweger as a feisty frontierswoman.", "Minghella's movie is stern and lucid for the most part and immensely enlivened by the presence of Zellweger and Hoffman who bring amusement to their roles.", "Excellent but upsetting, only for older teens.", "There are minor merits. mostly handsome production values, to Mingehlla's screen version of the acclaimed novel.", "Only Renee Zellweger maintains a Southern accent in this laughable attempt by director Anthony Minghella (\"The English Patient\") at filming Charles Frazier's love story set amidst the turmoil of the Civil War.", "So utterly manufactured for Oscar, it was nauseating.", "Despite its pretentious, episodic structure and emotional restraint, Cold Mountain retains its tension through multi-layered character development.", "Cold Mountain is a major achievement, studded with star performances from its entire cast, offering those who are prepared to experience it...", "Law interprets his laconic character so well that the lack of chemistry between Inman and Ada made me care very little if their romance was ever resurrected.", "A kitschy, lugubrious and deeply unhistorical exercise in self-congratulation.", "Kidman and Law share almost no screen time together, which harms the film.
