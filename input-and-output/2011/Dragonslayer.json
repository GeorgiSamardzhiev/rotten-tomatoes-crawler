{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A terrible dragon is terrorizing the medieval land of Urland in the 6th century. Representatives from the kingdom seek the assistance of the wizard Ulrich (Ralph Richardson) to defeat the dragon immediately -- Urland has been delivering virgins to appease the dragon, and their princess (Chloe Salaman) has rigged the lottery system they use in order to sacrifice herself next. But when Ulrich is killed, the task to confront the dragon falls to the wizard's apprentice, Galen (Peter MacNicol).", "rating": "84", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Matthew Robbins", "studio": "WaltDisneyPictures,ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 6, 2014", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The action isn't consistent or frequent enough, while the humor and the romance subplot aren't strong enough to make up for the downtime.", "If there was one film from the 1970s/80s early heyday of fantasy films that perfectly straddled the divide between kiddie movies and gorefests, it was Dragonslayer.", "It is a lively, fun, suspenseful, beautiful medieval romance what Excalibur tried to be, should have been, and wasn't.", "A really solid fun fantasy story that I think holds up quite well.", "This movie has two big things going for it -- the dragon and the man who masterminds its slaying.", "An innocent adventure that's technically slick and lacking in pretense, this film should provide a nice scare for kids, and maybe a few of the grown-ups too.", "It doesn't take itself too seriously and benefits from a good cast that includes Ralph Richardson and John Hallam. The effects aren't bad either.", "An unknown treasure of a fantasy film and well worth a look for fans of the genre.", "This film has smoky atmosphere, medieval sets, and rugged terrain strange enough to suggest far-off mythic lands; moreover, its special effects are positively staggering.", "The film excels as a visual exercise, as a study in adolescent psychology, and even as astute political analysis.", "Vintage fantasy epic is great, despite a too-graphic death.", "Saint George and the '80s", "A well intentioned fantasy with some wonderful special effects, Dragonslayer falls somewhat short on continuously intriguing adventure.", "", "Verges on the nasty for the nippers; sails close to dj vu for fantasy fans; fated, probably, to damnation by faint praise.", "", "entertaining adventure", "Looked far better when released due to tech aspects.", "The scenes involving the dragon are first-rate.
