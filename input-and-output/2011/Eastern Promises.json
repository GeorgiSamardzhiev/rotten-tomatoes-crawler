But where that became an overwrought bloodbath, \"Promises\" maintained a vicious focus on mob malevolence and personal peril.", "\"It starts very well, and we're immediately drawn into this world of dead pregnant teens, the Russian mob, the hermeneutics of tattoos and the archetypal disappointment of a father with his son.\"", "A captivating and intimidating presence, Mortenson is simply striking in his consecutive Cronenberg film, playing the slick Russian mob figure who suffers from a crisis of conscience with equal parts calm and intensity.", "Clearly a companion piece to (and just as good as, if not better than) 2005's fantastic A History of Violence, Eastern Promises is all about blood, in the familial as well as the literal sense.", "Even if the frequently low-key plot suffers from the occasional sleepy stretch, Mortensen turns in a magnificent performance.", "Late-period Cronenberg masterpiece", "David Cronenberg is a director who sets out to bring life (and death) back to violence. In Eastern Promises he does just that. It is a movie that will make audiences squirm and look away.", "Mortensen is very convincing as Nikolai, and his Russian accent is impeccable.", "Un ejemplo de cine negro contempor\u00e1neo realizado y narrado con gran precisi\u00f3n. Excelente elenco donde se destaca la notable labor de Viggo Mortensen.", "Eastern Promises has a lot going for it, which makes it all the more disappointing when the story takes a fatal turn towards the end.", "This is my favorite David Cronenberg film to date.", "...a Godfather for a new culture and era.", "Poderia perfeitamente ter se revelado um thriller absolutamente convencional caso n\u00e3o tivesse, a seu favor, dois elementos important\u00edssimos: a dire\u00e7\u00e3o segura e intrigante de David Cronenberg e, claro, a performance hipn\u00f3tica de Viggo Mortensen."], "rating": ["8/10", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "4/4", "A-", "4/5", "8.5/10", "2.5/4", "", "3.0/5", "3/4", "4/5", "3/5", "9/10", "9/10", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Matthew Lucas", "Dan Sallitt", "Deborah Ross", "Robert Koehler", "Mark Asch", "Ben Rawson-Jones", "Nick Rogers", "Jason Gorber", "Matthew Pejkovic", "Ian Buckwalter", "Mike Scott", "Fernando F.
