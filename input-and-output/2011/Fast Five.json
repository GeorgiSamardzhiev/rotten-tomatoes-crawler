Unfreakingbelievably inspired.", "This is the kind of movie where they throw two grenades, because one grenade is never enough. And that's a good thing.", "Diesel's ode to fatherhood is an action-fest that holds against everything that has come since.", "When it comes to ridiculously silly, fast-paced action movies, I guess you could do worse than \"Fast Five.\" You could also do a lot better.", "It's quick, it has an actual enjoyable heist storyline and it's good fun.", "Do we really need a fifth movie filled with car races, car chases and car crashes? Of course not. But then, we also don't need the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren or the Autobahn. But they add an awfully lot of fun to our short, brutal lives.", "Check your brain at the door.", "From the opening, adrenalin-pumping prison bus escape to a heart-pounding car theft aboard a fast-moving train, Fast Five throws it down from the jump.", "Each movie has two very good action scenes, usually at either end, but then about an hour and a half of the most asinine tough-guy nonsense between them.", "...achieves the sort of zen chaos that defines the Die Hard films", "Hard-core fans of the series with enjoy it but others should steer away from this over-the-top action flick.", "Forty minutes of this movie are big dumb fun. The other 85 forget the fun part.", "Has really transformed this series from camp action cinema to exciting heist cinema.", "The last 2 entries were stupid too, but at least this one was well directed and features some of the most impressive stunt work I've seen in years.", "Fast Five boasts incredible action scenes that are all varied and equally exciting. The film is full of clean, well choreographed shots that are easy to watch and the cast works great as a whole unit, making the film's running time breeze by.", "Like a shot of nitro to the franchise and shows there's plenty left in the tank.", "Manages to be more fun than any movie with its outrageous carbon footprint has any right to be.", "The series has found new traction in the heist format -- resulting in a fun and immensely entertaining ride.", "One film was enough, two was plenty, but five is just absurd.
