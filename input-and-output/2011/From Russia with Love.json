{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Agent 007 (Sean Connery) is back in the second installment of the James Bond series, this time battling a secret crime organization known as SPECTRE. Russians Rosa Klebb (Lotte Lenya) and Kronsteen are out to snatch a decoding device known as the Lektor, using the ravishing Tatiana (Daniela Bianchi) to lure Bond into helping them. Bond willingly travels to meet Tatiana in Istanbul, where he must rely on his wits to escape with his life in a series of deadly encounters with the enemy.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 58m", "director": "Terence Young", "studio": "DanjaqProductions,EonProductionsLtd.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 1, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The story moves too slowly, fattened up with activities that are inconsequential and not action oriented.", "From Russia with Love is just an exciting film from start to finish.", "From Russia with Love is a complete and total success as both a Bond film and a spy film, loftily enjoying the best of both worlds as it further establishes an indomitable template for more adventures to come.", "A comedown from Dr. No, whose brisk parody here slackens into a queasy compromise with the real thing that tries to have it both ways and so fails to have it either way.", "It has a few sillier moments, but in general it's quite the tense cold war spy film, with some good foreshadowing and a few really good action set pieces.", "From Russia With Love perfectly threads the needle between art and commerce, showing us everything that's allowed the series to keep on keeping on.", "The pace fast and furious and the invention, I suppose, inventive in the sense that a new nonsense always follows hard on the heels of an old nonsense and blow follows blow in crunching virtuosity of method.", "Cliff-hanging, 1964: that's From Russia with Love. That is, you get a complete serial every five minutes, often with a new babe or two falling for James Bond's masculine charms.", "The series' tightest expression of brutes playacting as gentlemen", "The success of Dr. No has no doubt given the James Bond team added confidence, if that was necessary, and From Russia with Love is made by people who clearly know that they now have a gilt-edged formula to play with.", "Everything that worked in DR. NO is fully realized here. Sean Connery is 10 times more confident here as 007, oozing charm and masculinity.", "The second Bond is one of the best in the series, due to the intriguing plot, sinister villains, and fabulously staged fight aboard the Orient Express.", "It has more in common spiritually with Le Carre than Fleming. Only after James Bond's vulnerabilities have been further exploited than in \"Dr. No\" does he succeed. \"Russia\" is about as far as it gets from the biggest Bond, but it's easily the best.", "One of just a couple Bond adventures that is genuinely great as cinema.", "Creative Cold War Bond thriller is best for teens and up.", "It's not too different from the non-Bond action thrillers of the same era, in which company it falls well short of the top film, North by Northwest. Plenty of period charm, though, and a few of the Bond franchise's most Austin Powers-esque moments.", "Much of it borders on the inept and the embarrassing, and that goes for the title song sung by Matt Monro, the \"singing bus-driver\".", "One of the finest Bond outings, this flourished in the paranoia of the times before the franchise was devalued by an over-reliance on gadgets, camp quips and a skittish lack of focus or direction.", "The film lacks the exotic, colourful flamboyance of the best of its successors.
