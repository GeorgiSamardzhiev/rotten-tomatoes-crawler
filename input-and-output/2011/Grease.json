In the immortal words belted out by Sha-Na-Na, I guess I was born to hand jive, baby.", "It succeeds...thanks to some toe-tapping numbers, sprightly hoofing and slick performances, not least by Stockard Channing as the most unruly teenager in town.", "A sugar-rush of a film.", "All of the characters in Grease are insufferable, the music is catchy without actually saying anything important or meaningful.", "Grease has energy and a total commitment to pleasing its audience.", "It's a winner.", "Couldn't the makers of \"Grease\" have unearthed one person who was alive in that time, perhaps even one who attended an American high school then, and checked their information?", "It has no kind of focus in atmosphere or tone, it doesn't even have a look. It's just sort of floating insult, shopping for a subject to light on.", "A grave disappointment to anyone in search of style or substance.", "What makes it work is its youthful vitality, the tremendous energy and imagination expended on its virtually wall-to-wall song and dance number.", "Anonymous and semi-competent filmmaking with no real personality, pepped up by the fake energy.", "The screenplay is a prepubescent shambles, the direction is by acne out of disposable douches, the dubbing and looping of the songs is painfully obvious, the characterizations are generally repulsive and the whole thing is utterly without style.", "A dumb but lively rock musical.", "I love the film's energy. I love the movie-star charisma of John Travolta in the lead. I love the \"am I doing this right?\" hesitancy of much of Olivia Newton-John's performance. I love the fact that the film is so unapologetically filthy."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "7/10", "4/5", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "4/5", "5/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "5/10", "", "C+", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Mike Massie", "Leigh Paatsch", "Jake Wilson", "Jan Dawson", "Danielle Solzman", "Matt Brunson", "Peter Freedman", "Peter Bradshaw", "BJ Colangelo", "Philip Wuntch", "Douglas Watt", "Judith Martin", "Stanley Kauffmann", "Derek Malcolm", "Arthur Knight", "Tim Brayton", "John L.
