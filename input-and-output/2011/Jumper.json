{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Aimless David Rice (Hayden Christensen) has the ability to instantly transport himself to any place he can imagine. He uses that gift to globe-trot, living on money he steals by \"jumping\" into bank vaults. He's captured by the evil Roland Cox (Samuel L. Jackson), who knows how to keep David from jumping. David escapes and reunites with his high school crush, Millie (Rachel Bilson), then forms an alliance with fellow jumper Griffin (Jamie Bell) and prepares for mortal combat with Cox.", "rating": "15", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Doug Liman", "studio": "NewRegencyPictures,Hypnotic", "theater_date": "Feb 14, 2008", "dvd_date": "Sep 15, 2016", "box_office": "$80.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Frustration over how easily the end product could have been tweaked for the better threatens to negate any positives.", "A disastrously written script. [Full review in Spanish]", "A film that is so unintentionally bad that only Jamie Bell, as a renegade jumper, and the always impressive Samuel L. Jackson manage to survive with their dignity intact.", "In the movie Jumper, it is almost as if the filmmakers made a conscious decision to keep their protagonist from applying his talent to the greater good.", "Jumper can't make the leap from cool concept to good movie.", "Jumper is a movie with no special powers. Despite its slick and sleek approach to extraordinary events, it remains quite ordinary and remarkably nondescript.", "A movie that has a tremendous premise and awesome special effects that are ultimately hindered by a script that prevents its characters from every fully taking off.", "", "", "Light entertainment is all about playing to an audience's fantasy. There have been quite a few well-crafted and entertaining films that have started the same way and gotten away with it, out of sheer creativity. Jumper is not one of those films.", "A better filmmaker would have given the material some kind of vertiginous rhythm, yet Liman just plods humorlessly, flavorlessly.", "Ignore the previews. Unless there was a drastic change of storyline in the editing room at the last minute, the final cut is a lot more interesting than originally advertised.", "Jumper is a popcorn movie, but without salt or butter. Too many of the kernels remain unpopped. It's like the Saturday matinees of yore. But by the time you've crossed the lobby after seeing Jumper, you've forgotten it.", "An elegantly idiotic sci-fi thriller that initially feels as though it might have derived from Philip K Dick -- but lacks the master's lysergic idiosyncracy.", "Jumper is almost in too much of a hurry at times and logic and cohesion suffer as a consequence.", "", "", "", "Director Liman is a major talent. He deserves better material to mold.", "The movie isn't terrible and I certainly liked the superhero aspect of it, but the romance doesn't work and it has a rushed, sloppy feel throughout."], "rating": ["4/10", "1/5", "1.5/4", "", "2.5/4", "", "4/10", "C", "1/5", "5/10", "", "3.0/4", "2.0/5", "", "", "3/5", "D", "2/4", "1.5/4", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Javier Oca\u00f1a", "Richard Propes", "Kathi Maio", "Brandy McDonnell", "Dan DiNicola", "Jeffrey Lyles", "Nell Minow", "David Fear", "Joshua Starnes", "Fernando F.
