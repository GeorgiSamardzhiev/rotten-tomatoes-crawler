It's not hard to see why Maddin has been deemed Canada's answer to David Lynch.", "Though self-referential to a fault, the deadpan humour, frayed logic and monochrome dazzle cast their own richly peculiar spell.", "", "Maddin bathes it in his usual weirdness.", "It's an exhausting feature, richly made yet punishing and baffling in a manner that doesn't invite further discussion. I suppose Maddin fans wouldn't want it any other way.", "Patric's performance is a deadpan treat. His can-do, take-charge character is in continual zany contrast to his surreal surroundings.", "'Keyhole\" is the first Guy Maddin movie that feels as if it got only halfway out of the director's head and onto the screen.", "The film is creepy, depraved and often funny and Maddin's most perverse outing since \"Tales from the Gimli Hospital,\" but although it compels through most of its running time, it doesn't quite sustain through the home stretch.", "Funny enough to be disarming even when it's spinning its wheels thematically."], "rating": ["3/4", "", "2/5", "", "4/5", "2/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3.5/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3/5", "4/5", "B-", "B", "C-", "3/4", "2/4", "B-", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Matthew Lucas", "Brian D.
