{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Gil Pender (Owen Wilson) is a screenwriter and aspiring novelist. Vacationing in Paris with his fiancee (Rachel McAdams), he has taken to touring the city alone. On one such late-night excursion, Gil encounters a group of strange -- yet familiar -- revelers, who sweep him along, apparently back in time, for a night with some of the Jazz Age's icons of art and literature. The more time Gil spends with these cultural heroes of the past, the more dissatisfied he becomes with the present.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 34m", "director": "Woody Allen", "studio": "Pontchartrain", "theater_date": "Jun 10, 2011", "dvd_date": "May 7, 2013", "box_office": "$56.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Allen's magic immerses us in nostalgia and romantic illusion during two hours of pure entertainment. [Full review in Spanish]", "Midnight in Paris is a bit of a one-joke skit, carried out at length.", "[A]n amusing fantasy with a slight but charming hook.", "A romantic comedy that boasts a clever and thought-provoking script.", "An uplifting ode to the notion that honouring the idealistic side of ourselves is often the best therapy.", "A whimsical delight, completely unexpected and awash with flavor and color.", "It's a chance for fans of Allen's earlier work to see glimpses of his brilliance, with a smart and charming literary fantasy that makes the most of the beautiful city that serves as its backdrop.", "The lack of professional polish feels just right to tell the story of kids who aren't 100 percent sure of what to expect from the big night, but those big, brassy anticipatory trumpets blaring The Temptations' \"Get Ready\" can't be denied.", "Midnight in Paris is frothy, witty, droll and a little enchanting -- all qualities often associated with the City of Light. It doesn't provoke a deep visceral response, but it's still very likable.", "It's funny, warm, even enchanting.", "Midnight in Paris intoxicates you, and it's hard not to fall under its spell.", "A gear shift for a director whose weathered career is jolted back to life, matching bouncy dialogue and a whimsically comical plot with the glossy climes of the sepia toned city of love.", "Adding depth to the comedy is a smart thematic idea: that golden ages are never golden to those living through them, who merely hanker to escape their own period too.", "Midnight in Paris is a very unselfish and lovely approach to inspiration, love, and the written word. A must watch.", "Overall, Midnight in Paris is so d'lightful, so d'lovely, you're liable to forgive it anything. If you weren't in love with Paris before, prepare to be seduced.", "... Allen brings his fantasy to life with such affection and joy that he transports us into his dream come true as a shared fantasy.", "Mr. Allen's habitual romanticizing of the wealthy has grown stale and is especially problematic in this recession.", "Breezy and casually profound, with a killer gimmick that keeps on giving.", "I continue to be utterly taken with Midnight in Paris.", "It's charming and smart, and riddled with little joys."], "rating": ["7/10", "", "", "4/4", "3/5", "3.5/5", "B", "", "B", "4/5", "B+", "4/5", "", "A-", "", "", "", "", "5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Yasser Medina", "Kathi Maio", "Felicia Feaster", "Sarah Knight Adamson", "PJ Nabarro", "Kate Rodger", "Micheal Compton", "Stephen Saito", "Abbie Bernstein", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Drew Taylor", "Edward Frost", "Lynden Barber", "Candice Frederick", "Eleanor Ringel Cater", "Sean Axmaker", "Martin Tsai", "Sean Burns", "Blake Howard", "Dann Gire"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Charleston City Paper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sarah&#39;s Backstage Pass", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newshub (NZ)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Moveable Fest", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Assignment X", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Examiner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Playlist", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Limelight", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Talk Online", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Saporta Report (Atlanta)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seanax.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Critic&#39;s Notebook", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">2UE That Movie Show", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Daily Herald"], "date": ["June 24, 2020", "March 6, 2020", "January 17, 2020", "January 14, 2020", "October 31, 2019", "August 24, 2019", "May 8, 2019", "March 5, 2019", "February 14, 2019", "January 8, 2019", "December 1, 2018", "December 1, 2018", "January 3, 2018", "September 8, 2017", "August 25, 2017", "June 16, 2016", "October 7, 2015", "May 3, 2015", "June 1, 2014", "August 3, 2013"]}}
