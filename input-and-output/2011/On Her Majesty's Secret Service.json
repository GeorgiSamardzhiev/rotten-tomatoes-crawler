It transcends the idea of a Bond film. Gorgeously photographed, thrillingly executed, and wonderfully performed, this is the franchise zenith.", "While trying to include all of the expected constituents of a Bond picture, many elements actually slow down the pacing - creating the longest runtime yet.", "On Her Majesty's Secret Service is the quintessential Bond film.", "The movie follows, almost too much, the exact same format of Bond flicks of the mid-sixties, and shows nothing new in character development or film technique.", "One of the best Bond movies of the entire series: it features cracking cinematography and there are some stupendous action sequences.", "The single most emotionally charged and unexpectedly fulfilling entry in the entire [Bond] series.", "Falls in the middle of the scale, it's not the worse, it's not the best, it's just a mix of both, just with a Bond who is often not very interesting to watch on screen...", "The dehumanising of Bond has reached a point where pain has become the last irrelevance and he soaks up punishment with the dreadful willingness of a cartoon cat.", "The sixth outing for 007 is a magnificently memorable adventure that sees Bond out to stop the dispersal of a killer virus by a bevy of beauties brainwashed by Telly Savalas's villainous Blofeld.", "Essential Bond viewing. It should definitely be among the five Bond films to make someone a fan of the series.", "Artistically, Bond's sixth entry, the only one to star Aussie George Lazenby, is much better than given credit to, though commercially it was one of the weakest.", "[Concentrates] more on the man than the equipment.", "Besides not being a terribly good Bond entry, it's also a poorly made film.", "An odd interruption in the Bond canon that's neither an unsung masterpiece nor an unmitigated disaster. It's half terrific, half terrible -the former most often when George Lazenby shuts up and Peter Hunt's masterful action instincts take over.", "Even hobbled as he is by a character he doesn't entirely get, and Peter Hunt's antagonistic direction, and the film's annoying tendency to remind us of Connery... George azenby puts up a good fight.", "007 in ski country -- and marriage territory?", "Just as entertaining and as visually attractive as the five previous Bond films.", "Film of break-neck physical excitement and stunning visual attractions in which George Lazenby replaced Sean Connery as James Bond.", "Director Peter Hunt manages to inject some life into this 1969 exercise with a wonderful ski chase, but otherwise the film is a bore."], "rating": ["3/4", "", "6/10", "4.5/5", "", "4/5", "", "3/5", "", "4/5", "9.5/10", "B+", "4/5", "1.5/4", "3.5/5", "8/10", "3/5", "B-", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Tom Meek", "Jake Tropila", "Mike Massie", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Tom Miller", "PJ Nabarro", "Zaki Hasan", "David Hogan", "Penelope Houston", "Jeremy Aspinall", "Jeffrey Lyles", "Emanuel Levy", "", "Austin Kennedy", "Nick Rogers", "Tim Brayton", "Charles Cassady", "Dennis Schwartz", "Variety Staff", "Don Druker"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cambridge Day", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Inquiry", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Confessions From A Geek Mind", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Free Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Zaki&#39;s Corner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">hoganreviews.co.uk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lyles&#39; Movie Files", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sin Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Yap", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader"], "date": ["September 25, 2020", "September 1, 2020", "August 27, 2020", "July 16, 2020", "January 22, 2020", "October 31, 2019", "January 29, 2019", "January 27, 2019", "July 7, 2018", "November 2, 2015", "August 24, 2015", "December 2, 2012", "October 23, 2012", "October 21, 2012", "August 10, 2012", "July 7, 2012", "December 15, 2010", "February 22, 2009", "October 13, 2008", "October 13, 2008"]}}
