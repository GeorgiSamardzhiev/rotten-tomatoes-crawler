He uses the realistic film as an avenue to what lies around and beyond the realism.", "Uma obra encantadora e hipntica.", "This is a very slow-moving movie, but it also has its attractions, such as its beautiful cinematography by Gkhan Tiryaki, particularly the wide angle shots showing the vastness of the Turkish landscape.", "The literal \"once upon a time\" of a series of disillusioned men who no longer think about the future because they obsess over the past.", "It's a masterpiece crime story that tells us as much about searching for the truth in modern Turkey as it does about violent criminals and those who prosecute them.", "You can't expect a slow burn drama to payoff spectacularly unless it burns slowly, and this is precisely what Turkish auteur Nuri Bilge Ceylan orchestrates in this masterful murder-mystery.", "It's a unique film that is best enjoyed knowing very little about it - so go and take a look", "Mesmerising cinema... This is a film that deserves your attention. It may be slow and the plot points obtuse, but the rewards are great", "Once Upon a Time in Anatolia is a film that stays on the mind days after the credits role. While quiet in tone it is rich in character and atmosphere.", "It runs 157 minutes, and I can't say you don't feel them.
