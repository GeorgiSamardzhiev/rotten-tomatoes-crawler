{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Photographer Tim Hetherington and journalist Sebastian Junger allow the realities of war to speak for themselves in this unnarrated documentary about a U.S. platoon in Afghanistan. The men of Second Platoon, Battle Company, 173rd Airborne Brigade teeter from naivete to weariness as months of alternating boredom and fighting take their toll. The loss of medic Juan \"Doc\" Restrepo leads the platoon to name an outpost in the remote Korengal Valley after him.", "rating": "96", "genre": "Documentary/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Tim Hetherington, Sebastian Junger", "studio": "OutpostFilms", "theater_date": "Jun 25, 2010", "dvd_date": "Nov 18, 2016", "box_office": "$1.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Junger and Hetherington have created one of 2010's best documentaries and an easy frontrunner for an Best Documentary Oscar Award this year.", "Hetherington thinks...this can be done without calling the war by its proper name, which greatly weakens his endeavor, despite all the heroics and good intentions...", "Junger and Hetherington create the doc equivalent of this year's gripping war movie The Hurt Locker, as they embed us in the boredom, sheer chaotic terror and macho camaraderie of soldiers from the Second Platoon...", "Restrepo does well to show the hell of war and the destruction it will bring upon the lives of so many young men.", "It's been a long time since journalists have shown combat so close up; it's possible that it has never been shot so intimately. There's nothing prurient or exploitative or glorifying or even editorial about it. The camera is there. We are there.", "The unnerving thousand-yard-stare of McDonaugh is impressively disturbing, but the constant anxious smile of Cortez carries a haunting emotional impact.", "Junger and Hetherington developed a deep sense of connection with these young men... The connection is what gives this film such power. This is war. There's no political viewpoint, no narration... you're just there with the soldiers.", "No one in Restrepo analyzes the war in Afghanistan in political terms or even describes it in terms of goals larger than the day-to-day mission. And yet, simply by bearing witness, the movie is a call to action.", "its most emotionally raw moments are indicative of their military subjects' exceptional comfort level with their observers ( ... ) the arid yet woody outcroppings high above the valley are an intriguing new terrain", "Restrepo succeeds as both a remarkable piece of cinma vrit documentary filmmaking and a tribute to the soldiers who are put through hell.", "Restrepo captures the physical trauma and psychological torment that forms the essence of the 'War is Hell' mantra, regardless of which flag you fight under.", "Everything about the way this film is shot, edited and packaged scream of a desire to show the war exactly as it is.", "Restrepo avoids political discussion. It just revels in the heroism of these impossibly young, brave soldiers who follow orders that at times seem pointless because following them is what their country has asked them to do.", "Though the movie tries not to make any kind of commentary, it's clear: this is just another reminder as to the utter pointlessness of this war.", "\"Restrepo\" puts a new face on the war in Afghanistan. A decidedly American face. Paul Chambers, CNN.", "Reminds us that wars are fought by individuals, not faceless armies.", "Despite being a moving reminder to support our troops, Restrepo cannot help but be \"Exhibit A\" in the case against the unwinnable \"War on Terror.\"", "Restrepo comes closest of any film I've seen to fully suggesting what being a soldier is like.", "The madness of warfare is starkly presented here, as dozens of questions potentially run through the viewer's mind.", "Despite disclaimers by the directors that this is not a \"political\" movie, \"Restrepo\" is one damned good reason to get the hell out of Afghanistan NOW."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "4.5/5", "3/4", "", "A-", "9/10", "3.5/4", "1", "8/10", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Joanne Laurier", "David Lamble", "David Harris", "Sue Halpern", "David Cairns", "Markie Robson-Scott", "Amy Taubin", "Nicolas Rapold", "Thomas Caldwell", "Simon Foster", "Mike Edwards", "Rene Rodriguez", "Jeffrey M.
