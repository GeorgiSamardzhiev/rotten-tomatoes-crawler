{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Just before hosting a dinner party, Philip Morgan (Farley Granger) and Brandon Shaw (John Dall) strangle a mutual friend to death with a piece of rope, purely as a Nietzsche-inspired philosophical exercise. Hiding the body in a chest upon which they then arrange a buffet dinner, the pair welcome their guests, including the victim's oblivious fianc\u00e9e (Joan Chandler) and the college professor (James Stewart) whose lectures inadvertently inspired the killing.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 20m", "director": "Alfred Hitchcock", "studio": "WarnerBrothers", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["\"Rope\" is a wonderful exercise in technique and the party guest characters are performed deliciously. Pay attention to the spectacular panorama of Manhattan's gleaming skyline.", "Hitchcock manages to keep everything light and humorous, but not without taking a couple of shots at a callous society actively choosing not to hear what they don't like.", "The resultant study of high class homicide is revolutionary, which, spectacular though the word may sound, does not mean that Rope is Hitchcock's best screenplay.", "In photographing the action, Director Hitchcock brought off a tour de force.", "Although the story of this verbose film is intriguing, it's not top-drawer Hitchcock.", "A disappointing addition to the great director's canon of work.", "It's Hitchcock experimenting. It's great.", "The trickery is still distracting, but there are hints in this 1948 film of the perversity that will yield Psycho, Strangers On A Train, Vertigo and Rear Window, so it's a must for Hitch collectors.", "Hitchcock liked to pretend that the film was an empty technical exercise, but it introduces the principal themes and motifs of the major period that would begin with Rear Window.", "Rope is an interesting experiment which largely succeeds.", "This still underrated masterpiece is both a brilliant technical experiment and a perverse manifesto, with James Stewart in typically ambiguous form as the lads' intellectual mentor.", "Though it is above the average for thrillers, the main interest lies in its technical novelty.", "While its fearless attempt to do something new makes it one of Hitchcock's most interesting movies, I can't pretend to regard it as anywhere near his best.", "Rope isn't merely a terrific movie; it is also a benchmark for which the intricate nature of the killer's mind can be simplified into immense clarity.", "Hitchcock could have chosen a more entertaining subject with which to use the arresting camera and staging technique displayed in Rope. Theme is of a thrill murder, done for no reason but to satisfy a sadistical urge and intellectual vanity.", "Rope is Hitchock's underrated classic that contains some of the most unique filmmaking of it's time. Hitchcock was so far ahead of filmmakers back then and so far ahead of a lot of the filmmakers today.", "Serves only as perverse entertainment.", "An elaborately perverse buffet served up at a pivotal moment in Hitchcock's career", "A perverse, provocative entertainment.", "\"A crime for most, a privilege for some\" is how Rupert classifies murder, but Hitchcock's eye-am-a-camera technique in Rope is after more than Nazi-superman residue still lurking after WWII."], "rating": ["", "3.5/5", "", "", "3/5", "3/5", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "7/10", "4/4", "", "5/5", "B", "", "", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Michael Calleri", "Michael J.
