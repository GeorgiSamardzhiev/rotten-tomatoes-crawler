But there's no aftertaste, except for that of burnt metal.", "A model of documentary storytelling efficiency.", "Though the film seemingly had a good ambassador for the sport, astounding racing footage and was well-presented, the subject matter never fully engaged me.", "You don't have to be a Formula 1 nut to enjoy this enthralling documentary ... Asif Kapadia's film Senna is so skillfully put together that its portrayal of a complex, charismatic and fascinating figure will grip even those with no interest in the sport.", "\"Senna\" is a streamlined piece of filmmaking, completely immersing the viewer in Senna's world and never losing momentum as it moves from one breakneck race to another.", "It's impossible not to be impressed by how director Asif Kapadia and writer Manish Pandey have managed to craft a biographical film completely out of archive footage.", "Uses an astonishing wealth of racing and interview footage - including film shot by in-car cameras during races - to chart in a compelling way the dramatic rise and heart-rending end of the Brazilian legend.", "The film is a snapshot in time of an imperfect, interrupted life more than a gateway drug to racing enthusiasm."], "rating": ["5/5", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "5/5", "", "3/4", "7", "3.5/4", "5/5", "2.5/4", "3/4", "B-", "4/5", "3.5/4", "4/5", "3/4", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Michael J.
