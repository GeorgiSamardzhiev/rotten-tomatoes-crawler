{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this dialogue-free slapstick comedy, film director Mel Funn (Mel Brooks) travels to the ailing Big Picture Studios to pitch his comeback film: the first feature-length silent movie in many years. Desperate for a hit, the studio chief (Sid Caesar) gives Funn and his cronies, Eggs (Marty Feldman) and Bell (Dom DeLuise), the go-ahead -- but only if they can get big celebrities to act in it.
