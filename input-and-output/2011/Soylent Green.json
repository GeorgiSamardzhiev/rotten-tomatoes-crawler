{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In a densely overpopulated, starving New York City of the future, NYPD detective Robert Thorn (Charlton Heston) investigates the murder of an executive at rations manufacturer Soylent Corporation. With the help of elderly academic Solomon \"Sol\" Roth (Edward G. Robinson), Thorn begins to make real progress -- until the governor mysteriously pulls the plug. Obsessed with the mystery, Thorn steps out from behind the badge and launches his own investigation into the murder.", "rating": "72", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Richard Fleischer", "studio": "MetroGoldwynMayer", "theater_date": "May 9, 1973", "dvd_date": "Oct 24, 2008", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Grounded in such a recognizable reality that the science-fiction elements are almost indiscernible.", "It seems, for all its futuristic malarkey, as contrived and antiquated a melodrama as may be seen any night on the Late Show.", "Soylent Green is Edward G.

As a man who remembers the wonders of civilization before it died, he is witty, cultivated and endlessly appealing.", "It's a hard one to judge, and while I enjoyed watching it, I don't see myself watching it again...I guess an average score then, but I am glad I finally watched it.", "Not well thought-out and a genuine disappointment for all its visibility in the popular conversation", "Where so many science fiction visions of the era have dated, this gritty creation of a depressed (and depressing) future... looks all the more real.", "", "...a movie based on an ending. And if you can't figure out that ending ten minutes into the movie, you aren't paying attention.", "The film was a typical seventies sci-fi effort, scientifically illiterate and unimaginatively composed.", "A sluggishly directed look at life and death in the 21st century.", "The somewhat plausible and proximate horrors in the story of Soylent Green carry the production over its awkward spots to the status of a good futuristic exploitation film.", "Uneven and slightly muddled futuristic horror story -- not really science fiction, more like an antipollution PSA gone berserk.", "Modestly entertaining.", "Good, solid stuff, assembled efficiently enough to be pretty persuasive.", "This futuristic thriller just seems to keep getting better with age.
