{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Swackhammer (Danny DeVito), an evil alien theme park owner, needs a new attraction at Moron Mountain. When his gang, the Nerdlucks, heads to Earth to kidnap Bugs Bunny (Billy West) and the Looney Tunes, Bugs challenges them to a basketball game to determine their fate. The aliens agree, but they steal the powers of NBA basketball players, including Larry Bird (Larry Bird) and Charles Barkley (Charles Barkley) -- so Bugs gets some help from superstar Michael Jordan (Michael Jordan).", "rating": "43", "genre": "Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 27m", "director": "Joe Pytka", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,NorthernLightsEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 15, 2008", "box_office": "$90.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Sans nostalgia it's serviceable kids' entertainment at best with a paper thin plot, but a lot of Looney Tunes antics.", "Give it a watch through I bet you will agree it's an entertaining flick.", "Space Jam is so obviously a work of the marketing/demographic-hunting mentality that it's rather surprising to find that the brazen creature gathers a certain charm as it rolls along.", "Space Jam is nothing if not a product made by men who gauge a film's success by how many soft toys it spawns.", "Children will love the energy of both the live and animated characters, and there's plenty to keep adults amused, too.", "The animation is eye-popping. And the co-mingling of 'toons and people is dazzling.", "Space Jam is not a movie. It's a feature-length infomercial for Michael Jordan Inc. and a host of related corporations that made their product-placement arrangements early.", "This isn't Looney Tunes, it's Sloppy Tunes.", "Brash, noisy and colourful, Space Jam should appeal to young basketball and cartoon fans alike.", "The movie could have been a gleaming showcase for cartoon wit. Instead it's an 87-minute commercial peddling sainthood for Michael Jordan.", "\"Space Jam\" soon demonstrates that this teaming of Michael Jordan and Bugs Bunny adds up to an air ball, not a slam-dunking \"Who Framed Roger Rabbit.\"", "There are some hearty laughs, to be sure. Basketball buffs and comedy-lovers will chuckle at the sight of NBA stars reduced to silly stumblebums when the aliens purloin their talent.", "\"Jam\" gets two stars for amiability and sporadic humor, with the proviso that it's worth at least three stars for 5-year-olds, who will love it.", "Its timing is blessed. Its audience is guaranteed. Its technique is spectacular. And it has two co-superstars almost universally admired and liked.", "Jordan seems dwarfed by Space Jam's high-concept shenanigans. His performance amounts to a series of one-note reaction shots. He seems to have as much talent for acting as for baseball. But at least he has something to fall back on.", "I can't see a kid today watching this movie and enjoying it.", "It's really bad, but the soundtrack cannot be denied. It alone bumps it up a few points.", "Space Jam is, at times, a hoot, especially when it has fun with Michael's less-than-stellar baseball career.", "A mindless, feature-length insult to the dignity and perfection of the Looney Tunes.", "Space Jam is a seamless marvel as Jordan slams and jams in the Looney Tune world.
