{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Aboard the USS Enterprise, the most-sophisticated starship ever built, a novice crew embarks on its maiden voyage. Their path takes them on a collision course with Nero (Eric Bana), a Romulan commander whose mission of vengeance threatens all mankind. If humanity would survive, a rebellious young officer named James T. Kirk (Chris Pine) and a coolly logical Vulcan named Spock (Zachary Quinto) must move beyond their rivalry and find a way to defeat Nero before it is too late.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 6m", "director": "J.J.

We're sorry for doubting you.", "Without a whiff of calculated cynicism, Star Trek '09 gives the series a much-needed adrenaline injection, while retaining the heart and pathos which has defined it since the beginning.", "There is the crackling relationship between a rakish, rebellious twenty-something Kirk and the clinically logical, yet emotional Vulcan-human Spock which keeps you glued to your seat. You can't seem to get enough of their dushmani-dosti business.", "Star Trek equals, and in some instances, surpasses, its mythological cultural presence and boldly goes where no film has gone before.", "Star Trek is that very rare beast; an eye-popping summer blockbuster with genuine heart and soul.", "Genuine escapist entertainment that breathes new life into a franchise long adrift in the final frontier.", "With its soaring space battles, gorgeous cinematography, and a grand score by Michael Giacchino, Star Trek is in many ways the quintessential summer blockbuster.", "A fun film with wall-to-wall action, some great special effects, and a group of actors who are more than ready to live up to the lofty heights of the original cast.", "Star Trek works both as a nostalgia trip for those that remember, and a fun, on-the-run sci-fi flick for those that are Trekkie virgins.", "The 2009 model Star Trek is laced with the fresh thrill of discovery.", "What Abrams has done with Star Trek is not simply take old characters and give them a new sheen; he has reinvented the whole dynamic of the USS Enterprise, pretty much all for the good.", "Overall this is one summer blockbuster that's worth the crowds you'll be fighting at the theater.", "Did all the fight choreographers in Hollywood boycott this production or something?", "For the most part this film was a successful retelling of a beloved story.", "J.J. Abrams dares to rewrite Trek lore with an origin story that chronicles the first voyage of the Enterprise crew with a mission that sends them into a whole new Federation history.", "Aside from the cool effects and surprise cameos from notable actor/director Tyler Perry and one of the U.S.S. Enterprise's original passengers Leonard Nimoy, there really wasn't much there.", "J.J.
