{"metadata": {"synopsis": "While shopping at an outdoor market, young reporter Tintin (Jamie Bell), accompanied by his faithful dog, Snowy, buys a model of an old ship called the Unicorn. A shady character named Sakharine (Daniel Craig) and later an American named Barnaby (Joe Starr) try to buy the model from him, but Tintin refuses. The lad discovers that the ship contains a clue about a hidden treasure, but before he can locate it, Tintin is kidnapped and given over to the custody of drunken Capt. Haddock (Andy Serkis).", "rating": "74", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Animation/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Steven Spielberg", "studio": "AmblinEntertainment,Kennedy/Marshall,WingNutFilms", "theater_date": "Dec 21, 2011", "dvd_date": "Dec 19, 2016", "box_office": "$77.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There's plenty of excitement and adventure but little else.", "Andy Serkis proves once again that he's the best vocal and motion capture actor working today.", "While the characters of Herge's comic book series have been around for quite some time, this feels as though it is something new, something to be discovered and perhaps inviting us to revisit those stories.", "It is fun, full of chases, has clever dialogues and sparks our imagination. [Full review in Spanish]", "The animation team manages to give life to a universe, that of Tintin, which has never played with such excellency at 24 frames per second. [Full Review in Spanish]", "While \"The Adventures of Tintin\" is by no means perfect I had a lot of fun with it, and I strongly suspect I would have been ecstatic if I still had been ten years old.", "Everyone will enjoy such a visually lush and exciting world adventure. It's like New Old Raiders of the Lost Ark.", "Altogether, Tintin is a well-made adaptation but there is room for improvement.", "[The] Adventures of Tintin is what you'd expect: a competent Hollywood stunt-fest.", "While it doesn't leave a lasting emotional impression like, say, Arthur Christmas, it does leave viewers connected enough to story, and of course to his intrepid pup Snowy.", "Spielberg's nearly boundless imagination takes us on a wildly entertaining journey into the old Saturday morning serials that made such an impact on the director as a child.", "There's enough to delight the undemanding youngster here and it's passable entertainment for the rest, but how much better this film would have been had Spielberg not buried it under layers of digital jiggery-pokery, and truly brought it to life.", "Tintin should go down as one of the first of the modern 3D films that does it right.", "For a holiday movie family outing, you could do much worse than The Adventures of Tintin.", "The characters aren't real enough to grab us, and without that, we're too aware of the well-trod path they're on to be engrossed.", "Though it looks good and sounds better, Tintin is frustrating to watch.", "It's like watching the books come to life in all their innocence and glory.", "Presents Spielberg in his element. We're very firmly in Raiders of the Lost Ark territory and the whole film plays out as a fun, sweeping adventure via land, sea and air with great set pieces and plenty of humour.", "Like the thrill-sapping hero and anti-climactic denouement, it botches the full satisfaction of adrenaline adventure.", "This is a rollicking adventure film, aimed at a young audience, but still to be appreciated by adults."], "rating": ["4/10", "3.5/4", "A-", "7/10", "", "", "B+", "3.5/5", "", "", "3/4", "3/5", "9.1/10", "", "B-", "2/4", "", "4/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "Yasser Medina", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Ard Vijn", "Julian Lytle", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Noah Berlatsky", "Leslie Combemale", "Matthew Lucas", "Adam Smith", "Michael Burgin", "Kofi Outlaw", "Abbie Bernstein", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Pratim D.
