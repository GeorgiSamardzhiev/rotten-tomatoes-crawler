{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the 1920s, actor George Valentin (Jean Dujardin) is a bona fide matinee idol with many adoring fans. While working on his latest film, George finds himself falling in love with an ingenue named Peppy Miller (B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo) and, what's more, it seems Peppy feels the same way. But George is reluctant to cheat on his wife with the beautiful young actress. The growing popularity of sound in movies further separates the potential lovers, as George's career begins to fade while Peppy's star rises.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Michel Hazanavicius", "studio": "uFilm,France3Cin\u00e9ma,Studio37,JDProd,LaPetiteReine,JourorProductions", "theater_date": "Nov 23, 2011", "dvd_date": "Feb 4, 2014", "box_office": "$44.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The experiment in recreating a silent motion picture is superbly realized.", "It achieves a contemporary greatness.", "While Singin' in the Rain will always remain my favourite musical ever, The Artist is a different experience all together - one that may surprise you if you give it a chance.", "A film that reminds us why we love celluloid with the drops of nostalgia spilled on all the shots that compose it. [Full review in Spanish]", "At its best, The Artist is a triumphantly modern silent film, which shows the influence of Fritz Lang, Josef von Sternberg, and Frank Borzage but never looks like a relic.", "Visually, the film is stunning with spot-on direction by Michel Hazanavicius...", "Movies don't get much more ebullient, charming, and heart-skippingly cute than the romantic comedy The Artist.", "[Director Michel Hazanavicius'] extensive research and efforts to ensure that The Artist is a respectable homage to silent cinema is admirable... it was a labour of love that was well worth the time.", "A really good way to introduce your kids to silent movies.", "A loving mishmash of styles and eras, and while it never quite fully adheres to its own conceit, it's still a lot of fun.", "It's magical, beautiful poetry that leaps off the screen with vivid imagination and precise execution.", "The fiction, ultimately, is the thing. The Artist, in the best possible sense, is more of a movie than a film. It's played for laughs and tears; it switches from action to tenderness; it's got a really funny dog.", "This joyful celebration of Hollywood's early days is vibrant and alive in a way that cinema has been lacking, and the passion that went into making The Artist is contagious.", "You will leave with many thoughts, but this foremost among them: A film like The Artist is why movies are made.", "From its pitch-perfect performances by actors Jean Dujardin and B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo to the snappy and sentimental score by Ludovic Bource, when all is said and done The Artist will be as admired as Charlie Chaplin's City Lights and F.W.
