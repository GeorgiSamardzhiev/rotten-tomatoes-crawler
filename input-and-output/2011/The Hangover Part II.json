{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Two years after the disastrous events in Las Vegas, it is now Stu's (Ed Helms) turn to walk down the aisle. Since his bride is from Thailand, Stu decides to hold the wedding there. Desperately hoping to avoid the mayhem of Doug's (Justin Bartha) bachelor party, Stu chooses what he thinks will be a safe option: an alcohol-free, prewedding brunch. But this being Thailand, and with Phil (Bradley Cooper) and Alan (Zach Galifianakis) again in attendance, anything can happen.", "rating": "33", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Todd Phillips", "studio": "GreenHatFilms", "theater_date": "May 26, 2011", "dvd_date": "Oct 1, 2013", "box_office": "$254.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Offers another dose of debauched misadventures from the \"wolf pack\" of comedians, sure to please those hungering for more after the original film.", "For the most part, director Todd Phillips plays it safe and goes for the surefire box-office hit.", "An almost identical rehash of the first film.", "This is a movie of bad things happening to relatively bad people, with precious little humor to break up the ugliness.", "A reprehensible film that is completely devoid of laughs.", "The Hangover Part II answers this riddle: how can a movie be a doting copy of the original and have the opposite effect?", "It's a fun distracting mile a minute race to the ridiculous last scene. That's what the title promises, and that's what you get.", "I'll admit it is fun to see these familiar characters again, even if it feels like we've seen this before. Cooper seems so relaxed as Phil that I think it is easy to overlook how good he really is here, while Helms isn't afraid to be the butt of the joke.", "If you want to see everything you saw in Hangover, only transplanted to Bangkok, with a drug-peddling simian and a missing human finger, then Hangover 2 is the movie for you.", "There are plenty of laughs to be had from the outrageous situations in which the guys find themselves.", "A sluggish, pointless and overly vulgar shot for shot copy of its far superior forebearer, though it is neither as clever or as tactful.", "An obnoxious installment in an obnoxious franchise, The Hangover Part II is also (intentionally or not) fascinatingly bent on disconcerting its target audience.", "The wickedly entertaining characters and actors each leave audiences in stitches as they go through the motions of an equally entertaining--albeit redone--plot that will thrill die-hard fans of the original.", "I don't believe that these characters would ever be friends, I don't like spending time with them, and I do not care what happens to them or their weddings or their adoptive babies or their relationship with Mike Tyson.", "Raunchy and unfunny, this sequel feels like a simple retread of its predecessor.", "If you love the first film, seriously, do not see this one. You'll ruin two movies at once.", "The cast is once again at the top of their game and there are some genuinely hilarious moments, but on the whole, The Hangover Part II is way too similar to the first film to be enjoyable.", "The Hangover: Part II shows the writers have absolutely no faith in their characters or their own ability to take them somewhere new.", "Overall, your enjoyment of this film will correlate directly to your enjoyment of the previous film. If you liked it, you'll like this one, if not, you won't enjoy the sequel as it's just more of the same.", "I think the first one is like GONE WITH THE WIND compared to this tired old turd."], "rating": ["7/10", "3.0/4", "C", "1/10", "1.5/5", "", "", "", "2/5", "3.5/5", "1/5", "", "B+", "", "2.0/5", "D+", "6/10", "2/5", "2/4", "1.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Brent McKnight", "Sean Collier", "David Harris", "Brian D.
