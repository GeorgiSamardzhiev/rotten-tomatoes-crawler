{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1960s Mississippi, Southern society girl Skeeter (Emma Stone) returns from college with dreams of being a writer. She turns her small town on its ear by choosing to interview the black women who have spent their lives taking care of prominent white families. Only Aibileen (Viola Davis), the housekeeper of Skeeter's best friend, will talk at first. But as the pair continue the collaboration, more women decide to come forward, and as it turns out, they have quite a lot to say.", "rating": "76", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 26m", "director": "Tate Taylor", "studio": "1492Pictures,HarbingerPictures", "theater_date": "Aug 10, 2011", "dvd_date": "Nov 23, 2015", "box_office": "$169.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An uplifting, feel-good movie.", "The Help works beautifully as an entertaining film about a troubling period in American history and the people who were impacted by it.", "Abruptly ending and slightly overlong it may be, the performances from the three female leads and the authenticity of the setting covers the cracks in an otherwise charming film.", "As perfect as a sipping a cold glass of sweet tea on a sweltering summer afternoon, TheHelp quenches your thirst for a perfect movie experience.", "It's beautiful to both look at and watch.", "A fun, satisfying and often quite moving summer movie for grown-ups.", "Wants to have a say about some serious subjects while at the same time appealing to the masses. To its credit, The Help succeeds more on the latter than it does the former, leaving a somewhat effective drama that could have been much more.", "Yes it has drawn some criticism for not being authentic enough in depicting the painful disparity, but in putting rarely heard voices on screen and telling it in a story as regonisable as this, The Help deserves only praise.", "The Help succeeds is because even though there are triumphs, they're not easy-and the spectacularly strong cast takes it to the level it needs to be at so it's believable and not cheesy.", "There's a luscious attention to paid to period detail, with brightly colored frocks and subdued homes. Yet the film itself is rather black and white, keeping it from being an unalloyed artistic success.", "The film has its moments of twee sentimentalism, but also resonates with a clear sense of poignancy, and is told in an accessible and hugely pleasurable way.", "The Help is a somewhat light-hearted take on the relations between black maids and their bosses in 1960s Mississippi, giving a simplified yet well-intended story of Kathryn Stockett\u00e2&#128;&#153;s novel for the big screen.", "\"The Help\" still serves as an uplifting reminder of how compassion, courage, empathy and honesty have helped change the world.", "It resonates with our desire to see wrongs set right at a time when so many white Americans were shamefully working against liberty and justice.", "At one point, Minny rhapsodizes about fried chicken and the solace of its preparation... I was convinced the movie was satirical.", "The performances prevail in The Help as Emma Stone shows her range as a serious actress and Viola Davis epitomizes courage through her somber eyes.", "Hokey, but a hit.", "It's worth seeing for the acting alone-Davis and Spencer are outstanding-but we should be asking ourselves the difficult questions the movie tries so hard to avoid.", "But aside from its substantial performances, The Help's completely uninteresting script caused the whole movie to be dead on arrival.", "The Help hands us a slap on the wrist when a knee to the groin or a fist in the face is what's needed."], "rating": ["7/10", "3.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "3/4", "", "4/5", "", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "B", "3/5", "", "C-", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Leslie Combemale", "Matthew Lucas", "Micheal Compton", "Shubhra Gupta", "Amie Simon", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Joseph Walsh", "Anna Smith", "Brandy McDonnell", "Megan Basham", "Roxane Gay", "Kiko Martinez", "Christopher Tookey", "Sarah Marrs", "Candice Frederick", "Eleanor Ringel Cater"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Musings of Guitargalchina", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Indian Express", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Three Imaginary Girls", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Examiner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Oklahoman", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WORLD", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Antonio Current", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Mail (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinesnark", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Talk Online", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Saporta Report (Atlanta)"], "date": ["November 30, 2020", "September 10, 2020", "December 11, 2019", "November 26, 2019", "July 26, 2019", "June 8, 2019", "May 7, 2019", "March 29, 2019", "March 5, 2019", "January 8, 2019", "August 29, 2018", "August 24, 2018", "August 8, 2018", "June 25, 2018", "May 24, 2018", "January 26, 2018", "January 4, 2018", "October 24, 2017", "September 8, 2017", "August 30, 2017"]}}
