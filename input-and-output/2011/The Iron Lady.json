{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In her twilight years, former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher (Meryl Streep) reflects on her life and career as she finally prepares to dispose of the belongings of her late husband, Denis (Jim Broadbent). Daughter of a Grantham grocer, she successfully broke through a double-paned glass ceiling of gender and class. Thatcher became the first female prime minister of the United Kingdom and remained as such for 11 consecutive years, until declining popularity forced her to resign.", "rating": "52", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Phyllida Lloyd", "studio": "Path\u00e9", "theater_date": "Dec 30, 2011", "dvd_date": "Nov 1, 2016", "box_office": "$30.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Worth the price of admission for seeing Streep alone.", "While Meryl's physical impression of the British PM in her blue-bloused prime is bang on the money, it is the way in which she captures Thatcher's unshakeable inner certainty that really pays off in the film's favour.", "Even Meryl Streep's powerful performance, as authentic as it is shown, is not enough to stop The Iron Lady's plot from sinking. [Full review in Spanish]", "Abi Morgan's bold script has Meryl Streep's Lady Margaret Thatcher hearing voices and experiencing a full-bodied apparition of her late hubby Dennis. This darkly clever film is about class warfare...", "And yet, there is poignancy in Lloyd's method too, and a defiance of the usual dramatic build of most bio pictures where it is always onward and upward.", "... [Meryl] Streep adds a richness to the character that is more telling than what is scripted in dialogue.", "Too much gorging on its female protagonist's poignant late failures of the flesh rather than showing what made her such a colossus in the first place.", "Make no mistake, this is Streep's show from the first frame to the last. She commands the film with a power and a grace that is as rare as it is breathtaking.", "As a portrait of a once-powerful woman coping with loss of her faculties, it is sensitive, it is subtle, it is acute. As a portrait of one of the primary leaders of a Western government, it feels partisan...and nonspecific, which is unfortunate.", "Streep, a prominent presence throughout, truly carries the film.", "This film was written by, directed by, and stars women. But it's the most anti-female film I've seen in quite some time.", "Ultimately saved by its intriguing modern day sequences and an unbelievable example of mimicry from Streep.", "The film in its entirety is just OK", "The Iron Lady is a better performance than it is film, although I suspect the performance will carry the day.", "The Iron Lady is a tremendously good movie in what it includes, but one that is sadly incomplete.", "... turning everything into a wobbly melodrama and placing all the responsibility on the steel shoulders of Meryl Streep is too much. [Full review in Spanish]", "Have you ever seen a terrific trailer, only to find yourself grossly disappointed in the actual film? Too much of the movie is about an elderly Thatcher shuffling about in a nightgown. (But I challenge anyone to shuffle as convincingly as Ms. Streep.)", "The film is just too sentimental for a political biopic and especially for one about Thatcher; a famously unsentimental character.", "Played by the always exceptional Meryl Streep, Thatcher is given more humanity than she may actually deserve.", "While the movie tries to cultivate Thatcher's life, it's not perfect. But the chemistry between Broadbent and Streep to elevate an untold romance beautifully elevates the flawed movie."], "rating": ["2.5/4", "3/5", "5/10", "", "", "", "3/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "5/10", "2.5/5", "", "C+"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Leigh Paatsch", "Yasser Medina", "David Lamble", "Felicia Feaster", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "PJ Nabarro", "Matthew Lucas", "Abbie Bernstein", "Nathalia Aryani", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Daniel Green", "Debbie Baldwin", "Deborah Ross", "Rebecca Cusey", "Erick Estrada", "Alexandra MacAaron", "Yasmin Shehab", "Neely Swanson", "Candice Frederick"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bay Area Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Charleston City Paper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Assignment X", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Diego Entertainer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Examiner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Ladue News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WORLD", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinegarage", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Women&#39;s Voices for Change", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cairo360", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Easy Reader (California)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Talk Online"], "date": ["September 12, 2020", "July 17, 2020", "June 24, 2020", "June 18, 2020", "January 17, 2020", "November 26, 2019", "July 24, 2019", "June 8, 2019", "February 6, 2019", "January 26, 2019", "January 4, 2019", "December 6, 2018", "November 10, 2018", "August 31, 2018", "March 21, 2018", "February 9, 2018", "December 3, 2017", "September 28, 2017", "September 18, 2017", "September 8, 2017"]}}
