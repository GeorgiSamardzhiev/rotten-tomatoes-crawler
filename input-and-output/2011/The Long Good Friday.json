{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the late 1970s, Cockney crime boss Harold Shand (Bob Hoskins), a gangster trying to become a legitimate property mogul, has big plans to get the American Mafia to bankroll his transformation of a derelict area of London into the possible venue for a future Olympic Games. However, a series of bombings targets his empire on the very weekend the Americans are in town. Shand is convinced there is a traitor in his organization, and sets out to eliminate the rat in typically ruthless fashion.", "rating": "96", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "John Mackenzie", "studio": "", "theater_date": "Apr 2, 1982", "dvd_date": "Nov 24, 1998", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The film lingers in the mind as an exposure of one man's illusions about himself and his world. Reality intrudes upon him like the hands around someone's neck.", "The simple, almost Shakespearean moral is that nefarious deeds breed a climate of contempt, and that any success will always be tainted.", "Sheer brilliance.", "Both an explosively violent thriller and a sharp evocation of the enterprise culture of the time.", "Hoskins' bullish, black-comic Napoleonism makes this movie: pugnacious, sentimental, a cockney Cagney.", "Has a shaky, peculiarly British charm that still makes it irresistible.", "Although The Long Good Friday is firmly rooted in a very different era -- early 1980s Britain is another country entirely -- the film still feels fresh and uncompromisingly tough.", "A conventional Brit thriller that's moderately entertaining.", "The screw-turning plot is great fodder for Hoskins and Mirren, who expertly calibrate their stressed-out character arcs. [Blu-ray]", "In many respects a conventional thriller set in London's underworld, The Long Good Friday is much more densely plotted and intelligently scripted than most such yarns.", "Its representation of Christ's modern-day doppelganger as a grubby little crimelord is certainly compelling.", "", "John Mackenzie directs this cornerstone of the British gangster genre with a minimum of flash and a dash of grim realism.", "The admittedly well-constructed set pieces are all too often diminished in effect by the uninspired camera-work.", "Explosive and original.", "", "I have rarely seen a movie character so completely alive. Shand is an evil, cruel, sadistic man. But he's a mass of contradictions, and there are times when we understand him so completely we almost feel affectionate.", "Though its plot contains much that's new, The Long Good Friday is a swift, sharp-edged gangster story in a classic mold.", "", ""], "rating": ["", "4/5", "5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4", "5/5", "B-", "3.5/4", "", "9/10", "3/4", "", "", "5/5", "3/5", "4/4", "4/4", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Peter Ackroyd", "David Jenkins", "Mark Kermode", "Adrian Turner", "Peter Bradshaw", "Dave Calhoun", "Wendy Ide", "Dennis Schwartz", "Peter Canavese", "Variety Staff", "Tim Brayton", "Joe Lozito", "Jeffrey M.
