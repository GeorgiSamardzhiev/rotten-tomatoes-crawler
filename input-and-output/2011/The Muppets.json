Desperate to save the Muppets' former stomping grounds, the three friends join forces with Kermit to reunite Miss Piggy, Fozzie and the rest of the gang to hold a telethon to raise the $10 million they need to save the studio .", "rating": "95", "genre": "Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "James Bobin", "studio": "WaltDisneyStudios", "theater_date": "Nov 23, 2011", "dvd_date": "Nov 23, 2015", "box_office": "$88.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Filled with musical numbers to which Amy Adams surrenders herself with wonderful results.", "This movie is a great return of great characters to stage that entertain both old and bring in new fans to the felt world of Jim Henson.", "The Muppets is a sugar-coated treat that you can enjoy again and again.", "Find your rainbow connection and make your dreams come true with TheMuppets!", "The clunky sporadic brilliance of yore is gone; in its place is a big, slick, hollow juggernaut, slathered in nostalgia, sentimentality, and a hollow winking irony meant to substitute for humor or ideas.", "It is nigh unto impossible to stay cynical or hardened after more than an hour of watching the wholly earnest irony-free resurgence of Jim Henson's collection of classic characters who don't hold a mean bone in their felt-covered bodies.", "It's not my favorite Muppets movie... but I really think this one is a lot of fun.", "A film that works well as a nostalgic piece, but also serves as the perfect comeback piece -- introducing these characters to a new generation.", "The Muppets is an affectionate homage to the characters those of us of a certain age know and love.", "The Muppets' flaws are numerous, yet not substantial enough to put off true Muppets fans.", "You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll feel like a kid again, and your kids will become a new generation to know these beloved characters.", "On behalf of the lovers, the dreamers and me, thank you Jason Segel for making all of us very, very happy.", "I just hoped for more vaudevillian anarchy and less sentimentality. Sometimes, it is a mistake to revisit your childhood with the same expectations.", "Although the movie's villain isn't developed enough and the horde of fuzzy characters becomes a bit overwhelming, \"The Muppets\" doesn't just coast on sentimentality or familiarity.", "It's a film for 2012, for the 99 per cent, for the Occupiers who have been criticised as Starbucks-quaffing smartphone revolutionaries seeking a rainbow connection that could only be called 'kermunism'.", "None of it comes off as clever as it probably did on paper.", "... The Muppets not only restore their name in the movie, but they prove to the audience that they're back and they're still as cute and entertaining as ever before.", "Quite simply the most fun I've had at the cinema in ages.", "If anything, The Muppets succeeds in reminding us why audiences both young and old adored these talking pieces of felt in the first place: They were the first icons of family entertainment to keep it real.", "It's good to have them back.
