{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Erika Kohut teaches piano at the Conservatory in Vienna. In her early forties, she lives at home, cooped up with her mother, whose influence Erika escapes only on her regular visits to porn cinemas and peepshows. Her sexuality is an affair of morbid voyeurism and masochistic self-mutilation. Erika and life travel separate paths. Until one day, one of her students gets it into his head to seduce her...", "rating": "73", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 58m", "director": "Michael Haneke", "studio": "MK2Productions,CentreNationaldelaCinematographie,LeStudioCanal+,Arte,Eurimages,LesFilmsAlainSarde,ArteFranceCinema", "theater_date": "Mar 29, 2002", "dvd_date": "Nov 4, 2017", "box_office": "$1.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["If perfection is the only exaggerated nomenclature with which to describe Haneke and Huppert's sordid tango through considerations of submission and control, then it's surely embodied here in the form of Erika Kohut, the piano teacher.", "I found The Pianist unpleasant but, as a case study of female desire, repression, and oedipal trauma, not at all outr\u00e9.", "The Piano Teacher is high art.", "For a director who's often raged against the manipulations of Hollywood, Haneke is as gifted a puppetmaster as Steven Spielberg.", "The film veers into wildly compelling -- and unsettling -- territory.", "Both director and actor were clear on their intentions from the start, and this alignment produced a movie that holds up as one of the best arthouse films of the last 20 years, with a nearly unmatched quiet kind of intensity.", "The acting awards are utterly perplexing: Benoit Magimel's transformation in the final act smells fake. and Isabelle Huppert's piano teacher is the nearest to a one-note performance she's given in 20 years.", "[Huppert gives] the single finest performance I have ever seen her give, and therefore almost by default one of the best of the decade.", "", "A film of Artaudian cruelty, and a boundary-breaker in the cinema's exploration of its own erotic and artisanal id.", "", "A revolting and shocking work devoid of redemption and purpose.", "", "If genital mutilation, rape, incest and twisted acts of sexual gratification are your thing, then this is the film for you.
