[Full Review in Spanish]", "It is, in short, CINEMA that makes CINEMA great. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Princess Bride is very much a parody of the very nostalgic culture it was replicating and celebrating", "The cult of The Princess Bride is still strong 32 years after its release.", "Everything about The Princess Bride is ... charming. By far, the film's dialogue is its most enduring legacy.", "...a lavish studio spectacle...", "One of the all-time great fantasy movies, channelling both a rollicking spirit of adventure and genuinely uplifting humour all ages can appreciate.", "A film that's for just about everyone and anyone that can appreciate good storytelling, a classic romance, riveting action, and genuinely funny comedy.", "Mandy Patinkin, an actor not known for humor, is particularly wonderful as Inigo, a Spaniard out to avenge the death of his father at the hands...", "It manages to be both tongue-in-cheek and achingly sincere.", "The Princess Bride is a worthy descendant to the Fractured Fairytales of yore. The characters -- both real and imaginary -- give every frame of The Princess Bride its own magic mirth.", "It's an adventure which reaches back to golden-age Hollywood and the devil-may-care world of Douglas Fairbanks or Tyrone Power playing Zorro, or Errol Flynn playing Robin Hood.", "The Princess Bride easily transcends expectations, as a fantasy that has a few pertinent things to say about the genre, including the odd fact that the heroes of such things are often prettier than the heroines.", "A unqualified success that blends New York wit with timeless storytelling; a risky piece of filmaking that never feels so.", "...it's ultimately not difficult to see why The Princess Bride has become something of a classic in the years since its 1987 release.", "...somehow spoofs the conventions of fantasy romance without teetering into irony.", "As you watch this enchanting fantasy, feel free to be thrilled or to giggle, as you wish.", "In spirit The Princess Bride recalls The Neverending Story, which also was about a contemporary boy`s fantastic adventure. Reiner's film is likely to please adults more than kids and to last in memory more than most films this fall.", "Patinkin, the most dazzling movie swordsman since Errol Flynn, steals the movie with his athletic grace and delivery of lines like: \"My name is Inigo Montoya!
