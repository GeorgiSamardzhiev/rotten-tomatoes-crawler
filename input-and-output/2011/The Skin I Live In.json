{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Ever since his beloved wife was horribly burned in an auto accident, Dr. Robert Ledgard (Antonio Banderas), a skilled plastic surgeon, has tried to develop a new skin that could save the lives of burn victims. Finally, after 12 years, Ledgard has created a skin that guards the body, but is still sensitive to touch. With the aid of his faithful housekeeper (Marisa Paredes), Ledgard tests his creation on Vera (Elena Anaya), who is held prisoner against her will in the doctor's mansion.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h", "director": "Pedro Almod\u00f3var", "studio": "ElDeseoS.A.,FilmNation,Canal+Espa\u00f1a", "theater_date": "Oct 14, 2011", "dvd_date": "Jun 10, 2014", "box_office": "$3.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Antonio Banderas returns to Spain and mentor Pedro Almodovar in this outlandish melodrama dripping with science-fiction tropes.", "An objectively oddball piece of work...", "The Skin I Live In is the most disquieting film I've seen in years. Don't let that stop you from seeing it, though. It's also the masterpiece we've long awaited from Pedro Almodovar.", "\"The Skin I Live In\" is a film where love takes many forms, some of which are perverse, but it's how the director is guided by his one for cinema that makes his latest feel so alive.", "The Skin I Live In is well worth seeing. Mad scientists overwhelmed by hubris are nothing new but no iteration of the story has been told in quite this way.", "... in this polymorphous shocker Almod\u00f3var has crafted one of his most berserk and bewitching fables about the fluidity of gender and the unpredictability of desire.", "The Skin I Live In is a definite must-see, as all its elements harmoniously blend to create a cinematic masterpiece that stands out not just this year, but over the course of the past decade.", "Banderas' performance achieves a perfect chill.", "Not since David Cronenberg have surgery, sex and violence frolicked in the same stained bed so skillfully.", "Georges Franju's 1960 classic horror Eyes Without a Face is an obvious touchstone but the new film is more ridiculous than horrific.", "In Almodovar's world, the flesh is deception, the comedy dark, the sex weird and the tears real; this time, however, the director just wasn't able to pull off all of these elements.", "\"The Skin I Live In\" fails because it doesn't have a moral or anything else to say in spite of its self-seriousness.", "Almod\u00f3var has a body of work as rigorously personal as any out there, and, even with its flaws, he wears this latest Skin rather well.", "Despite the typically invigorating sense of line and framing, The Skin I Live In withholds the director's customary satisfactions and affirmations. The result is a saga of obsession that, in its saturnine undertone, maintains a hard-to-enjoy integrity.", "This is a lush, deeply pleasurable film to experience on a sensory level; Almodovar couldn't produce a boring frame if he left the lens cap on.", "Pedro Almodovar's The Skin I Live In, a terrific, twisty thriller that is one of the filmmaker's best and one of the year's best films.", "It's as disquieting as it is unsatisfying, a slog through gender issues, surgery and violence - sexual and otherwise.", "A movie puzzle that confounds and then unnerves with an impact as shocking as any of the most infamous of cinema last-reel shockers", "I was agonising over every twist and turn. I was shuffling in my seat. I was feeling physical reactions to the scenes and quite simply I was impressed with Banderas' strikingly nuanced performance under the incredible direction of Almod\u00f3var.", "Leave it to Pedro Almodovar to figure a uniquely twisted way to unsettle."], "rating": ["", "3/4", "3.5/4", "", "3/4", "", "5/5", "", "9/10", "", "", "", "", "", "B", "9/10", "2/4", "4/5", "4.5/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Lamble", "David Nusair", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Stephen Saito", "James Berardinelli", "Steve Erickson", "Joseph Walsh", "Steve Erickson", "Jovanka Vuckovic", "Lynden Barber", "Kong Rithdee", "Martin Tsai", "Jos\u00e9 Teodoro", "Nicolas Rapold", "Will Leitch", "Will Chadwick", "Roger Moore", "Matt Looker", "Blake Howard", "Michael Dequina"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bay Area Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Examiner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Moveable Fest", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ReelViews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Nashville Scene", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gay City News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Revolver", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Limelight", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bangkok Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Critic&#39;s Notebook", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Comment Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Comment Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Deadspin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">We Got This Covered", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tribune News Service", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheShiznit.co.uk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">2UE That Movie Show", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieReport.com"], "date": ["June 10, 2020", "August 3, 2019", "January 5, 2019", "December 21, 2018", "December 20, 2018", "August 29, 2018", "August 29, 2018", "March 3, 2018", "February 6, 2018", "January 3, 2018", "May 9, 2016", "October 7, 2015", "November 5, 2013", "July 1, 2013", "June 23, 2013", "March 2, 2013", "December 28, 2012", "September 25, 2012", "May 15, 2012", "April 6, 2012"]}}
