{"metadata": {"synopsis": "New York City roommates Peter (Tom Selleck), Michael (Steve Guttenberg) and Jack (Ted Danson) are all successful and happily unmarried, but Peter and Michael get the surprise of a lifetime when a young woman abandons an infant in front of their loft. They also receive a letter stating that the child, named Mary, belongs to Jack, but he's away on business. Michael and Peter are then forced to care for Mary -- and though they make hopeless babysitters, they soon become quite attached to the girl.", "rating": "76", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Leonard Nimoy", "studio": "TouchstonePictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 13, 2015", "box_office": "$167.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Three Men and a Baby is a lot of fun, and more progressive than you might expect.", "...a conventional yet mostly entertaining comedy...", "The three lead performances, Selleck's especially, are wonderfully self-effacing.", "The film works well despite its predictability, perhaps because of it.", "It has the likability of the first movie.
