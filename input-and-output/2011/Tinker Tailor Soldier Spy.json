Undersecretary Oliver Lacon (Simon McBurney) calls veteran agent George Smiley (Gary Oldman) back from forced retirement to ferret out the mole and stop the flow of vital British secrets to the Russians.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 7m", "director": "Tomas Alfredson", "studio": "WorkingTitleFilms,ParadisFilms,StudioCanal", "theater_date": "Jan 6, 2012", "dvd_date": "Dec 1, 2015", "box_office": "$24.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The cast is astounding, amassing a record assortment of popular British actors.", "A fine directorial achievement indeed.", "A slow burn, fraught with intrigue, tension, and personal and professional betrayal.", "Undeniably, given its narrative construction, it is an absorbing espionage thriller. [Full review in Spanish]", "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy tells a challenging tale. Emotionally distant, winding in on itself over and over again. I find it to be brilliant if cold.", "Inherently a tale of intrigue, Alfredson may have created one of the most introverted spy thrillers ever filmed.", "Those with a refined palate for challenging, intelligent and charismatic storytelling should unashamedly gorge themselves on the feast presented here.", "A strikingly crafted homage to a bygone era of filmmaking that also feels thrillingly contemporary.", "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is everything that one feels it should be. It is complex, intelligent, quiet, intense and keeps its cool throughout.", "[Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy] is a welcome throwback to old-time espionage stories.", "There are many good reasons why movies cannot run on for six hours, so when cinematic necessity compels squeezing a fine six-hour show like Tinker, Tailor into one third the time, audience and story are likely to be shortchanged, as happens here.", "So beautifully executed and so visually absorbing and so atmospherically hypnotic that I wonder this: would it have been awfully greedy to have hoped to have wholly understood it, too?", "Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is a wonderfully stylised piece that accepts the importance of visual aesthetics without losing any substance in terms of plot or narrative action.", "It starts slow, and a bit confusing for those not familiar with the novels, but builds to intensity, creating a taut, sinister spy story for grown-ups.", "Tinker, Tailor is a smart-but-hardly-heady genre piece which picks a handful of influences and boils them down to into pliable notions that can then be used to form a style; as far as utterly derivative filmmaking goes, it's pretty damn good.", "From top to toe this is one of the best crafted, best acted, most tautly presented thrillers I've seen in a really long time.", "This is a fantastic spy film through and through...", "If I were to apply a rating system to this film, it wouldn't be stars or thumbs. It would have to be four elbows, as in the number of times I had to elbow my husband to wake him up during the movie.", "Unlike the Bond films, this movie reminds us that being a British government agent is always a job, and rarely an adventure.", "Tinker Tailer Soldier Spy reminds us the past is never past, even when it seems like it's all over...except the Russian caroling."], "rating": ["6/10", "3.5/4", "B-", "8/10", "", "3.2/5", "4/5", "3.5/4", "A-", "3/4", "", "", "5/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "3/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Brent McKnight", "Yasser Medina", "Ed Travis", "David Harris", "Leigh Paatsch", "Matthew Lucas", "Abbie Bernstein", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Russell Baker", "Deborah Ross", "Joseph Walsh", "Rebecca Cusey", "Ignatiy Vishnevetsky", "Sarah Marrs", "Yasmin Shehab", "Neely Swanson", "Craig D.
