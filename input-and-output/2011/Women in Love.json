So the movie ends up like a gaudy chariot pulled by twelve furious stallions who have been nibbling on locoweed.", "To make the novel so excitedly, lip-smackingly \"period\" in its decorations leaves unreconciled problems of thought and character, a kind of weightlessness never securely anchored in Russell's direction or in Larry Kramer's devoted script.", "Despite a growing portentousness towards the end, and moments of silliness scattered throughout, a surprisingly restrained, even respectful adaptation of DH Lawrence's novel.", "Directed with style and punch by Ken Russell, this is an episodic but challenging and holding pic.", "Yet it is to the film's great credit that, in depicting that \"puritanical insistence,\" heterosexuality is revealed to be the most unnatural form of coupling.", "If you find your interest waning as the film moves on, it is likely due to exhaustion of trying to generate empathy with characters who constantly evade such connection. So much of the film feels written and performed, but rarely lived.", "The story occasionally grows choppy and diffuse, yet the visual splendors never fail to take command.", "Unable or perhaps unwilling to rein in the source material's sentiment, [director Ken] Russell created a work defined by its earnestness-something that remains potent nearly 50 years later.", "Bates and Reed's homoerotic sparring would be sexy and shocking in any context. But Women in Love's talkier scenes are more exciting than any screen nudity could be.", "Ken Russell is interested in using the novel's sexually charged characters as figures to be placed into a series of fevered tableaux.", "It's Russell as restrained as he can be, who has fun delving into the sexual explorations of the author.", "", "", "Controversial for its time Ken Russell classic.", "", "", "Though deviating from D.H. Lawrence's novel considerably, this is Ken Russell's most fully realized narrative film, lavishly mounted and well acted, especially by Glenda Jackson in an Oscar-winning performance.", ""], "rating": ["4/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "3/4", "", "", "2.5/4", "B", "2.5/5", "5/5", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "A-", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "Paul Schrader", "Manny Farber", "Penelope Houston", "Geoff Andrew", "Variety Staff", "Melissa Anderson", "James Kendrick", "Matt Brunson", "Janelle Okwodu", "Simon Abrams", "Keith Watson", "Dennis Schwartz", "Christopher Null", "Cole Smithey", "Steve Crum", "Philip Martin", "Thomas Delapa", "Emanuel Levy", "Jules Brenner"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Artforum", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Artforum", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Q Network Film Desk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Vogue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Village Voice", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slant Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmcritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Video-Reviewmaster.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boulder Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Signals"], "date": ["August 25, 2020", "June 30, 2020", "June 13, 2019", "June 11, 2019", "June 11, 2019", "June 11, 2019", "August 14, 2018", "April 26, 2018", "April 9, 2018", "December 7, 2017", "November 29, 2017", "November 26, 2017", "March 28, 2013", "December 30, 2006", "November 1, 2005", "June 11, 2005", "May 6, 2005", "April 28, 2005", "December 18, 2004", "August 7, 2004"]}}
