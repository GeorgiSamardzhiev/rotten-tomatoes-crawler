{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This expansive period drama follows two childhood friends in northern Italy during the early 20th century. Alfredo Berlinghieri (Robert De Niro) and Olmo Dalc\u00f2 (G\u00e9rard Depardieu) grow up as close companions despite their class differences. However, they drift apart as adults, Alfredo embracing his landowning heritage and Olmo championing workers' rights. As the years go by, they see the rise of fascism in their country, and eventually their values find them directly in conflict.", "rating": "58", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "4h 3m", "director": "Bernardo Bertolucci", "studio": "Paramount", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 30, 2016", "box_office": "$66.1K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The totality is problematic, but there is enough great cinema to make this an absolute must for all cineastes.", "Its eccentricity, and the incorporation of this eccentricity into the staid format of the historical spectacular, proves to be its redemption.", "A social and lyrical song of a bygone -- but not forgotten -- era...
