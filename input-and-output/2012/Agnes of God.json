{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Dr. Martha Livingston (Jane Fonda) is a court-appointed psychiatrist sent to evaluate Sister Agnes (Meg Tilly), a young nun whose infant has been found strangled. With Agnes claiming a virgin conception and having no memory of giving birth, Livingston must distinguish between the lies and the nun's perception-altering faith. Complicating her investigation, Livingston continually clashes with the overbearing Mother Miriam Ruth (Anne Bancroft), who insists that Livingston leave Agnes alone.", "rating": "43", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "Norman Jewison", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation,DelphiIVProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$25.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Rich characters all.
