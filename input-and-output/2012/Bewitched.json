Looking to make a comeback, he signs on to play the role of Darrin in a movie version of the popular 1960s sitcom \"Bewitched.\" Jack insists that an unknown is hired to play Darrin's better half, the beguiling witch-housewife Samantha, so the studio finds an up-and-comer named Isabel Bigelow (Nicole Kidman).
