{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Thomas (David Hemmings) is a London photographer who spends his time photographing fashion models. But one day he thinks he may have photographed something far more sinister: a murder. After taking pictures in the park, Thomas is horrified to find an ambiguous image lurking on the edge of the frame, which could be a shadow, but looks like a gun. The only thing clear is that the woman (Vanessa Redgrave) in the photo has appeared at his studio -- and wants the pictures he took.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Michelangelo Antonioni", "studio": "BridgeFilms", "theater_date": "Dec 18, 1966", "dvd_date": "Mar 11, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Blow-Up is a work of wit and caustic intelligence, superbly disciplined, elegantly styled, visually astonishing and, for all that, turned out with the decep- tive simplicity of perfect craftsmanship.", "Blow-Up demands and succeeds by immersing us truly into an ambience where nothing is what it seems, including our own ability to comprehend, define, and explain.", "a quest for hidden meaning amid all the artifice and emptiness of Swinging London.", "As usual, Antonioni's images have a seductive loveliness. No fashion photographer ever took more glamorous shots, or made London look more inviting.", "I always liked to think that even the worst film by Antonioni would be better than the best by almost any other director. Now I know that this is so, because I've just seen his worst film, and I was right: Blow-up is still an absolute must.", "Michelangelo Antonioni's film is an inquiry into the modernist concern of what art is and how it affects life.", "At once provocative and mystifying, dazzlingly immersive and utterly remarkable.", "This remains a failure for which I would trade ten successes: a totally absorbing experience on the screen, a film of deceptive, tricky surfaces and cold perceptions.", "Michelangelo Antonioni's first English language film is an allegorical murder mystery whose abstract parameters delineate a society where images are more important, and lasting, than reality.", "Inspiring everyone from Francis Ford Coppola to Mike Myers, Michelangelo Antonioni's arty thriller remains an absorbing, eerie enigma.", "A prize '60s artifact, Michelangelo Antonioni's what-is-truth? meditation on Swinging London is a movie to appreciate -- if not ponder.", "In Blow-Up [Antonioni] smothers this conflict in the kind of pompous platitudes the press loves to designate as proper to \"mature,\" \"adult,\" \"sober\" art.", "Despite its thriller hook, Blow-Up is less a mystery than a portrait of swinging alienation.", "Antonioni's first English-speaking film is a seminal work of the 1960s, reflecting swinging London as well as dealing with voyeurism, artists' social responsbilities and other relevant issues.", "O rigor est\u00e9tico aqui exibido por Antonioni, somado \u00e0 excepcional montagem de Frank Clarke, \u00e0 bela fotografia de Carlo Di Palma e \u00e0 atua\u00e7\u00e3o inspirada de Hemming, garante ao filme um vigor e um charme que s\u00f3 crescem com o tempo.", "This is so ravishing to look at (the colors all seem newly minted) and pleasurable to follow (the enigmas are usually more teasing than worrying) that you're likely to excuse the metaphysical pretensions.", "There may be some meaning, some commentary about life being a game, beyond what remains locked in the mind of film's creator, Italian director-writer Michelangelo Antonioni. But it is doubtful that the general public will get the 'message' of this film.", "Still thought provoking, fascinating film making.", "Inventive, richly styled film, a visual classic.", "Pop-culture icon that has become a cult classic."], "rating": ["", "4/5", "", "", "", "4/4", "4/4", "", "A+", "4/5", "", "", "5/5", "A", "5/5", "", "", "5/5", "", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Robert Hatch", "Nicholas Bell", "Anton Bitel", "Wendy Michener", "Richard Roud", "Chuck Bowen", "Dustin Putman", "Penelope Houston", "Cole Smithey", "", "J.
