{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Kenai (Joaquin Phoenix) is a young Indian brave with a particular distaste for bears. When his brother Sitka (D.B. Sweeney) is killed by one, Kenai in turn kills the bear, only to be magically transformed into one himself. To make matters worse, his other brother Denahi (Jason Raize) vows to kill the bear Kenai has become. Kenai's only hope is a magical mountain where he believes he can be changed back to a human, and he enlists a real bear cub, Koda, to get him there.", "rating": "37", "genre": "Animation/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 25m", "director": "Aaron Blaise, Robert Walker", "studio": "WaltDisneyPictures", "theater_date": "Nov 1, 2003", "dvd_date": "Dec 13, 2015", "box_office": "$85.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A succession of sequences already seen many times before that turn the film into a predictable trance.
