From the aftermath of five days of conflict emerges the trial of the controversial Chicago Eight, activists who include pacifist David Dellinger (Dylan Baker) and Youth International Party founders Abbie Hoffman (Hank Azaria) and Jerry Rubin (Mark Ruffalo).", "rating": "81", "genre": "Animation/Documentary/Drama", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Brett Morgen", "studio": "ParticipantProds.,ConsolidatedProductions,RiverRoad", "theater_date": "Feb 29, 2008", "dvd_date": "Jun 8, 2017", "box_office": "$176.5K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Brings a sense of immediacy and even anarchy to an often-told story.", "Chicago 10 is a clever film, and visually engaging.", "Ingenious.

Sometimes you make a noble point by acting like a jackass.", "Director Brett Morgen earns high marks for finding a most innovative way to illustrate a regrettable chapter in American history.", "...despite its storytelling creativity, it doesn't generate as much inspiration or excitement as I would have expected.", "Chicago 10 is an art-house rarity that manages to visually dazzle while peeling away the layers of this contentious moment in time, giving viewers an eyeful of social unrest and wondrous screen fantasia.", "Chicago 10 is that nearly perfect marriage of style -- edgy, different -- to documentary subject: 1968, that seminal year so celebrated in 2008 for changing the America that came after it.", "The raw, gritty, real stock footage just doesn't match with the spoof-like quality of the animated trial.", "Short on nuance but long on passion, Chicago 10 recreates the gradual boil-over from peaceful gathering to chaos by augmenting ample, close-range footage with the kind of sonic boom that seldom accompanies political documentaries.", "Indirectly scolds today's meek populace for letting its war-minded government rage unchecked.", "Chicago 10 brandishes enough sickening reality (Chicago police clubbing protestors, etc.) to make the audience gasp with astonishment.", "The Chicago riots may have been our parents' history, but this is not our parents' documentary."], "rating": ["3.5", "", "", "4/5", "", "6/10", "7/10", "B", "", "7/10", "B", "", "6/10", "A-", "4/5", "2.5/4", "3/5", "3.5/4", "3/4", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Ed Travis", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Ben Kenigsberg", "Kelly Vance", "Ian Buckwalter", "Nora Lee Mandel", "Stephen Schaefer", "Jean Lowerison", "Sarah Boslaugh", "Bryant Frazer", "Kam Williams", "John J.
