Both sing their hearts out with infectious application.", "[Sissy Spacek] brings to the character a wide-eyed ingenuousness and refreshing love of the small but wondrous things in life.", "The musical biography by now has a pattern as fixed as a traditional 12-bar blues. It is just that some blues are better than others, and so are some musical biographies. Coal Miner's Daughter... is on of the best of its kinds.", "Coal Miner's Daughter is most interesting when it's conveying the bleak, dreary Kentucky landscape that formed Lynn's childhood. It's least interesting when it's portraying the agonies of show-business success.", "Because the film never breaks out of its conventional matrix, it never really becomes interesting. Despite Sissy Spacek's. performance. it is impossible to feel much for her or for her family.", "Loretta Lynn's tough but heartwarming biopic.", "A thoughtful, endearing film charting the life of singer Loretta Lynn from the depths of poverty in rural Kentucky to her eventual rise to the title of 'queen of country music'.", "Though a classic rags to riches saga, this biopic of Loretta Lynn doesn't fall victim to cliches, and benefits immensely from the astonishingly authentic turn from Sissy Spacek, who does her own singing; even real-life singer Lynn liked the picture", "Highly conventional stuff, but lovingly constructed to produce unremarkable but heart-warming entertainment.", "\"Coal Miner's Daughter\" risks understating its story to make Loretta Lynn's biography part of a larger fabric, and the gamble pays off.", "The movie isn't great art, but it has been made with great taste and style; it's more intelligent and observant than movie biographies of singing stars used to be.", "Superior biopic with an unforgettable performance by Sissy Spacek", "", "", "", "A rousing musical biopic that is a cut above its peers.", "This uplifting drama, based on Loretta Lynn's autobiography, shows how her marriage kept changing to accommodate her career as the First Lady of country music.", "In a time before the TV music channels made star biographies into such a formulaic joke, Coal Miner's Daughter was the real deal."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "B+", "", "", "3/4", "5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Dave Kehr", "People Staff", "John Pym", "Michele Chausse", "Charles Champlin", "Bruce McCabe", "Peter Ackroyd", "Heather Boerner", "Variety Staff", "Emanuel Levy", "Geoff Andrew", "Janet Maslin", "Roger Ebert", "Jon Niccum", "Daniel M.
