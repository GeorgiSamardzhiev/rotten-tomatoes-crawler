But Die Hard is also smart, satirical-and, in an odd way, heartwarming.", "The director's spectacular ability to compose the plans and take advantage of the full range of the panoramic format possibilities. [Full Review in Spanish]", "It's a glorious scene-stealer for Alan Rickman, though it's a credit to Willis's cheeky charisma that his scene is not in fact stolen.", "Die Hard is a great example of the Hollywood studio system getting moviemaking right - the film is a perfect storm of story and talent coming together.", "Die Hard still feels as fresh and thrilling as the first time it screened.", "From the superb pacing through to the sarcastically sinister villainy of Alan Rickman, this remains a crucial template for the modern action film.", "It's as though the filmmakers approached each scene by asking themselves how entertaining they could make it.", "One of the very best action pictures of all time... Yippe-ki-yay indeed.", "Die Hard is film's equivalent of a terrorist attack on your senses, but Willis' intensity and presence push it into guilty pleasure territory.", "What sets 'Die Hard' apart from most action movies is the depth of characterization. [Detective John] McClane is not a macho toy with a bullet-proof body. He is a thinking, feeling man who can't believe he's doing most of what he does.", "Here, postmodern architecture meets Reagan-era Hollywood cinema and makes lots of movie magic.", "Exciting, tense, expertly edited and directed, full of well-constructed characters and lots of action. [Full review in Spanish]", "There are good performances from everyone in this long, often funny, very violent but exciting melodrama.", "A masterpiece of populist filmmaking.", "Yippee-ki-yay, action fans.", "For all its moments of almost overwhelming cheese, Die Hard is still the definitive action thriller.", "Within the narrow framework of the hard-action genre, Die Hard is almost as good as it gets.", "Willis gleefully strips down the action movie to a pretend game for children who like to fire guns and shoot bad guys. Machismo may never be the same.", "Die Hard is probably the most manipulative movie I've seen this year, but since it makes no bones about being manipulative and does it so well, this not only isn't a problem -- it's fun."], "rating": ["1", "", "", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "4/5", "5/5", "8/10", "", "", "", "4/4", "3/4", "1", "5/5", "5/5", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Brian D.
