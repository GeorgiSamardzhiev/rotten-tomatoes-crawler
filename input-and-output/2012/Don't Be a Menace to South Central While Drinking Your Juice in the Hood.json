{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Innocent young black man Ashtray (Shawn Wayans) is forced to move into a tough Los Angeles slum with his family, including his oddly streetwise, pot-smoking grandma (Helen Martin). Before long, Ashtray's nuclear-armed gangster cousin Loc Dog (Marlon Wayans) introduces him to a bizarrely comic crime underworld. Luckily, Ashtray falls for urban poet Dashiki (Tracey Cherelle Jones), and she convinces him to go straight -- but he must deal with her manic ex-boyfriend Toothpick (Darrel Heath).", "rating": "31", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Paris Barclay", "studio": "IvoryWayProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 23, 2016", "box_office": "$18.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Perhaps if \"Menace'' had been shorter and some of the weaker sketches had been left on the cutting-room floor, it would have added up to a stronger whole.
