{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A variety of adolescents at a suburban high school drift through a seemingly uneventful day, until two students arrive with violent intentions. Alex (Alex Frost) and Eric (Eric Deulen) have developed elaborate plans to enter their school and gun down as many of their peers as possible. Although Alex and Eric are seen as the victims of bullying, and the pair have carefully plotted their attack, most of the violence is committed with a detached sense of randomness.", "rating": "73", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 21m", "director": "Gus Van Sant", "studio": "HBOTheatricalDocumentary", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 23, 2017", "box_office": "$1.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Elephant represents exactly the sort of risk-taking and inspired approach that Van Sant has never shied away from.", "...it remains one of the most unsettlingly accomplished American movies of the new millennium, and exactly as difficult to categorize or definitively interpret as its maker intended.", "There's much to argue with, but this unconventional, oddly beautiful film resonates in unexpected ways.", "Elephant is a cool, distant film, content for the most part to observe the routine of high-school life.", "Watching it, one is left with the cold realization that a story like this had to be made for the screen, and it had to be done so exactly with this level of intensity.", "It offers a dismaying whiff of mortality in the spaces between the girls' chattering remarks in the cafeteria and in the blank eyes of boys who feel alienated from everything except the guns they cradle so lovingly in their arms.", "What I'll remember most vividly about Gus Van Sant's extraordinary \"Elephant\" is not the violent climax but the state of grace that precedes it.", "Elephant creates gorgeous, wide-open spaces that allow viewers the freedom to reflect without having a point-of-view imposed on them.", "The approach is oddly riveting, though, because the tension builds slowly, and you know what's going to happen at the end of the day.", "Director Gus Van Sant takes a powerful approach to this material, without being heavy-handed.", "One of the most disturbing films I've ever seen, one that gave me a rush of emotions of sadness, horror, disbelief, shock, and anguish.", "One of the most stimulating and provocative films of the year.", "Van Sant's least 'show-offy', most personal, best picture in years (maybe ever), and an honourable attempt at respectfully considering the unbearable.", "The film doesn't try to explain, but to put us in a subjective time and space, a place where it's impossible not to feel the abject horror of random violence.", "A failure to communicate", "A film without any easy answers, or answers at all.", "A morally dubious waiting game.", "", "Elephant is one of this year's boldest movies....But, in refusing to assert a point of view about what troubles American youth, Van Sant...flees the scene of the crime", ""], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "4/4", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "3.5/4", "", "3/5", "", "", "A", "C", "4/5", "3/5", "B+"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Soham Gadre", "Adam Nayman", "David Ansen", "Mark Steyn", "David Keyes", "David Denby", "Joe Morgenstern", "Scott Tobias", "Christy Lemire", "Jeffrey M.
