Because at the end of Eternity and a Day, Angelopoulos somehow translates a character from the world of dreams to the world of reality instantaneously, before your eyes.", "It has a great deal of somber beauty to recommend it.", "The quiet, hypnotic intensity of the cinematic journey one experiences in Eternity and a Day is a rare and lasting pleasure.", "Invites and encourages us to reap the blessings of true connection with others.", "For at least half of its length, it is quietly revelatory, luminous and invigorating, and for those reasons it makes essential viewing.", "What had been a realistic work, lyric but realistic, slides into ostentatious symbolism.", "Makes a somber redemption song out of melancholy and infinite sadness, one whose eloquence transcends its stark Andrei Tarkovskyian dankness and somnambulism.", "This is not a masterpiece, but it contains moments of rare beauty and its contemplation of life, death, regret, and memory has a subtle power.", "Angelopoulos has created another masterpiece, one that recalls such classics as Bergman's Wild Strawberries and Kurosawa's Ikiru.", "A gorgeous elegy of a film.", "Angelopoulos' meditation on the meaning of one man's life is genuinely hypnotic in its way of transcending ordinary narrative.", "Overall, Angelopoulos' film gives the viewer a sense of the infinite ... even if its languid artiness occasionally lulls you to sleep.", "Consider giving this worthy anachronism a couple of hours of your time. If you can tune into its somber, hypnotic wavelength, you may be surprised at the raw emotional impact it delivers in key scenes, and at its ability to provoke your imagination.", "It is a statement about the work of an artist, a collector of diverse elements then molded into a coherent, beautiful whole.", "A deeply felt character study."], "rating": ["3/4", "", "", "3.5/4", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "5/5", "3/4", "4/5", "3/4", "3/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Sandra Contreras", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Geoff Andrew", "Jeffrey M.
