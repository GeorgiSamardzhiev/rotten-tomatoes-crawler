Pressured into marriage and sudden fatherhood by his girlfriend (Candy Clark), Ernie can shrug off his personal problems when he enters the ring.

But it is the acting, the feeling for character, which makes this film so extraordinarily different.", "In addition to the splendid cinematography, along with the songs that animate the soundtrack, the acting is outstanding. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Huston rolled up his sleeves, grabbed a camera, and dived head-first into Gardner's unapologetic pessimism...what resulted was one of the finest films of his career.", "A knockout scene by that grand old battler, John Huston.", "The movie's bleak, but it's funnier than most comedies, and it suggests that life's toughness doesn't preclude joyfulness.", "So you say to yourself, this Fat City is pretty damn realistic, even if you know in your heart that \"realistic\" and Hollywood should not be printed on the same page-otherwise paper ignites. Still, you're marveling at it.", "Huston and his performers give the material an elating, transcendental verve, especially during the sequences in which words fail the characters and interminable silences take over.", "A terse, sharp, downbeat but compassionate look at the underside of smalltown American life in the west.", "Both an extraordinarily realistic look at the bottom rungs of the fight game and a moving exploration of the human condition.", "The movie is crafty work and very much a show. In one way or another, right down to the percussively abrupt open ending, it's all about being hammered.", "Fat City is most notable for terrific performances all around, especially those of Stacy Keach, Susan Tyrell, and a baby-faced Jeff Bridges.", "Grim and downbeat, John Huston's superlative drama about a bunch of losers in Stockton California is splendidly acted by Stacy Keach, Jeff Bridges, and particularly Susan Tyrrell in a well-deserved Oscar nominated turn.", "Marvellous, grimly downbeat study of desperate lives and the escape routes people construct for themselves, stunningly shot by Conrad Hall.", "", "", "The downbeat sports drama is a marvelous understated character study of the marginalized leading desperate lives.", "The movie's edges are filled with small, perfect character performances.", "Huston really gets the flavor of Stockton, CA, and with its run-down drinking establishments, sleazy gyms, and bad coffee joints.", ""], "rating": ["3/4", "", "", "8/10", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "4/4", "", "6", "A-", "", "4/5", "4/5", "A", "4/4", "4/4", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Matt Brunson", "Robert Sullivan", "Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos", "Nathanael Hood", "Walter Goodman", "Alan Scherstuhl", "David Thomson", "Keith Uhlich", "Variety Staff", "", "J.
