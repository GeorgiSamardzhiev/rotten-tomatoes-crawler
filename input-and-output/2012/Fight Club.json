{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A depressed man (Edward Norton) suffering from insomnia meets a strange soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and soon finds himself living in his squalid house after his perfect apartment is destroyed. The two bored men form an underground club with strict rules and fight other men who are fed up with their mundane lives. Their perfect partnership frays when Marla (Helena Bonham Carter), a fellow support group crasher, attracts Tyler's attention.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 19m", "director": "David Fincher", "studio": "ArtLinsonProductions,Fox2000Pictures,TaurusFilm,NewRegencyPictures", "theater_date": "Oct 15, 1999", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$37.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Cult films are seldom great films, they just connect with a corner of the audience more intensely than was intended, elevating their status. That's \"Fight Club.\" And appealing to the wrong sort of cult just makes that clearer.", "It's bold, it's gritty, it's rebellious, it's unapologetic, it takes risks, and it's narrator reflects the frustrations of many people.", "A savagely funny film that shocks, provokes and sucker punches the viewer. You either love it or hate it.", "Unsubtle subliminal messages pair with skewed perceptions to demonstrate overstressed stylization and a hopelessly circuitous plot.", "'Fight Club' examines David Fincher's portrait of toxic masculinity from the female gaze.", "Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are both perfect in David Fincher's anarchic, moody and violent film. [Full review in Spanish]", "Perhaps it is postmodern filmmaking, whatever that means. In any case, Fight Club remains the ugliest, most inhuman film since Natural Born Killers.", "The film's tongue is far too firmly in its cheek at all points of its discourse to ever take its characters' actions too much at face value.", "The movie demands a certain attention and is not easily dismissed, but there is something deeply unsettling about a work that uncritically espouses brutality as a function of alienation and nonconformity.", "Pitt dominates the screen every second he's on it, and it simultaneously represents his weirdest, funniest and most charismatic role of his career.", "Filmmaker David Fincher has, perhaps notoriously, infused Fight Club with a decidedly off-kilter sort of vibe that's reflected in its various attributes...", "Mr Loaf was never better on screen than as the ill-fated, big-hearted Bob Paulson, the only warm character in a cold, cold movie.", "An outrageous mixture of brilliant technique, puerile philosophizing, trenchant satire and sensory overload, Fight Club is the most incendiary movie to come out of Hollywood in a long time. It's a mess, but one worth fighting about.", "Just when it's supposedly getting to grips with its theme, the movie goes utterly haywire and becomes yet another brainless, humourless bone-cruncher.", "...capturing perfectly the stirring discontent of the 90s & the madness (geopolitical/economic) that would erupt globally in the decade to come. For in his love of anarchic (self-)destruction, Tyler shows the new Millennium through a glass darkly.", "Oh, for the time when men were men and were encouraged to beat the tar out of one another. That's the world \"Fight Club\" pines for.", "Technically gorgeous... But it's such a wreck of tone and intellect.", "Fight Club may be iconic and technically proficient, but it's more distant than perhaps any film to attain \"modern classic\" status.", "perhaps the most post-9/11 film to have been made pre-9/11, capturing perfectly both the stirring discontent of the Nineties and the madness (both geopolitical and especially economic) that would erupt globally in the decade to come.", "Fight Club jettisons its sense of humour 60 minutes in, and, so far from satirising the tiresome \"crisis of masculinity\" stuff sloshing around the airwaves either side of the Atlantic, the film simply endorses it."], "rating": ["2/4", "1", "", "8/10", "5/5", "4/5", "C-", "4/5", "", "4/4", "3.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "", "2/4", "6/10", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Roger Moore", "Marianna Neal", "Jason Best", "Mike Massie", "Sez\u00edn Koehler", "Fico Cangiano", "Bob Thomas", "PJ Nabarro", "Patrick Z.
