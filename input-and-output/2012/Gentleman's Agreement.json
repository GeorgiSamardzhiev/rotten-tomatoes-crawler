{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When journalist Phil Green (Gregory Peck) moves to New York City, he takes on a high-profile magazine assignment about anti-Semitism. In order to truly view things from an empathetic perspective, he pretends to be a Jew and begins to experience many forms of bigotry, both firsthand and through a Jewish friend, Dave Goldman (John Garfield). Phil soon falls in love with beautiful Kathy Lacy (Dorothy McGuire), but their relationship is complicated by his unusual endeavor.", "rating": "76", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 58m", "director": "Elia Kazan", "studio": "TwentiethCenturyFox", "theater_date": "Nov 11, 1947", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["In the end (aided by a momentous parting shot), the human drama feels just as powerful as the morals.", "Gentleman's Agreement is the sort of film that contains the usual drama for a Zanuck movie but the subject matter is what makes the film so groundbreaking.", "Gentleman's Agreement still comes across as a smart, incisive, and engrossing drama, and although times have changed since 1947, the subject it so boldly tackles remains timely and relevant to this day.", "The film's tone towards anti-Semitism is not the harsh note of intellectual indignation, but the polite murmur of argument. The film reduces a grave problem to dialogue.", "It is brave in having something to say about a problem of living today and it is outspoken in the saying of it. It has been directed with rare understanding by Elia Kazan.", "Much of the 'message' is lost in a welter of words. Sentiment, too, is spread as thickly as we would like our rationed butter.", "The film is great stuff throughout, and Is well worth seeing.", "Here is a great and moving film -- the best that has come from an American studio for several years.", "Powerful film still makes one of the most insightful attacks on racism ever shot.", "Can Gentleman's Agreement be a salient, good movie, and still be entirely too corny? Maybe it's just because I'm looking back at it from the modern day, but Gentleman's Agreement plays hokey and preachy a lot of the time.", "The words ring out with clarity from the Mayfair screen and there is no mistaking their meaning. They are not lost on the wind, but hit you full in the face, making you sit up and take notice of the force behind them.", "Diabolically dull and somber to the point that it's almost worth laughing at it, except that Gregory Peck's incredibly serious expressions have the tendency to make laughter dry out and die.", "An eye-opener in its day, this exposure of high-society racial prejudice still has the power to compel.", "Agreement was tame, cautious stuff even back then.", "By dispassionate critical standards, Gentleman's Agreement is not a success. It is a tract rather than a play and it has the crusader's shortcomings.", "The movie is as powerful today as when it captured the Best Picture Oscar a few years after Hitler's genocide ended in Europe.", "Gentleman's Agreement is an important experiment, honestly approached and successfully brought off.", "It looks pretty timorous now.", "[A] brilliant and powerful film.", "The style may have dated but the motives which drive the film still feel fresh and energetic."], "rating": ["8/10", "5/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "5/10", "4/5", "C+", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Danielle Solzman", "David Sterritt", "Josephine O&#39;Neill", "Harry MacArthur", "Nelson Burns (Te Pana)", "Erle Cox (The Chiel)", "SMH Staff", "Michael E.
