{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Friends Gerry (Casey Affleck) and Gerry (Matt Damon) hike into Death Valley, but they stray so far from the trail that they have no idea how to get back. Initially, they maintain morale by rehashing old stories and reciting inside jokes, but the gravity of their situation sinks in as a return to civilization becomes more unlikely. As the sheer scope, hypnotic pull and spirit-crushing mirages of the desert affect the men, their will to live and sense of identity is challenged and transformed.", "rating": "61", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Art House & International/Drama/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Gus Van Sant", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 11, 2019", "box_office": "$236.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It looks like a beautifully-shot but under-scripted indie feature everybody involved knocked out in a couple of weekends.", "A difficult, demanding sit, but it wouldn't have been nearly as fascinating and rewarding a film if it weren't.", "", "The two stars...[Casey Affleck and Matt Damon]...both playing characters named Gerry, wander across the desert for some reason, and if you enjoy watching them on any pretext, you'll probably enjoy this; if you don't, you won't.", "Gerry, in all ways, is a film geek film. Not for mass consumption, perhaps, but nonetheless a potent expression for those that like this sort of thing.", "", "Likely to sharply divide critics, Gerry goes back to his indie roots with a minimalist work that carries itself almost entirely through the awesome yet austere visuals and sounds.", "", "Absolutely transfixing at one moment and unbearably boring the next.", "Although the images from the film are poetic and are more fondly recalled in hindsight, in this case art film for art film's sake doesn't fly very high.", "", "Hiking for Godot: Van Sant's existential Blair Witch Project's daemon lurks within.", "Gerry proposes simplicity; even the most capsulated descriptions of it are dubious.", "Nothing special to show at the end for this existential trip to nowhere.", "Are these guys as smart as they sound or as dumb as they act?", "The picture can be read as a warning about the perils of improvisation -- a neat joke given how fruitful that method proves here.", "One of those films that are better in hindsight - you won't forget the scenery and the torture of enduring it.
