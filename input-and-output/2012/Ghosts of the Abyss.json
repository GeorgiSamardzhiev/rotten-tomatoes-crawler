{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Veteran filmmaker James Cameron delves into the inspiration for his film \"Titanic\" by traveling to the mammoth cruise liner's final resting spot. Accompanied by a team of historians and friend Bill Paxton, Cameron uses unprecedented technology to take the viewer on an unscripted tour of this famous wreckage. This look back through time allows audiences to see never-before-photographed images and understand more about what transpired on that fateful night.", "rating": "80", "genre": "Comedy/Documentary/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h", "director": "James Cameron", "studio": "WaldenMedia,EarthshipProductions,WaltDisneyPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$17.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Cameron reconstructs life aboard in the shape of living tableaux of passengers and crew, seen in spectral mode, eating, drinking, dancing or promenading among the watery remnants of their vessel. It is done with finesse and, oddly, is deeply touching.", "If you see only one James Cameron-directed movie about theTitanic -and you should - see the one that doesn't star Kate and Leo.", "A bit slow-going and strangely emotionless at times. But Bill Paxton's nervous expressions add humor, and the film's jaw-dropping glimpse at the Titanic are powerful, to say the least.", "James Cameron's latest memorial to the spirit that exists mournfully and sadly in utter silence as the effects of time and salinity slowly and inexorably take their toll.", "I wouldn't call \"Ghosts of the Abyss\" a compelling documentary or even an artistic one. It's more like a visit to a museum-in this case, one that's 12,500 feet below the surface.", "Go and marvel at this spectacular piece of visual history; it's 60 minutes very well spent.", "This hour-long feature, edited down from 900 hours of footage, is both a technical marvel and a heartfelt memorial to those who died when the ship sank in 1912.", "What's the point of this documentary?", "This is a brilliant showcase for IMAX and Cameron who offer an entertaining and fascinating glimpse of history to us all.", "Despite Paxton's whooping every time a new artefact comes on screen, it's hard to be constantly excited about watching a bunch of rusty, decayed junk -- historic and three-dimensional though it may be.", "It may not have the organisation of 'art', but it's quite some postcard.", "", "Cameron has gone from shaping the zeitgeist to spoonfeeding it", "The picture's beauty and Cameron's amazing photographic work provide much pleasure. It's just that...there is the feeling we've been there and seen it all before.", "As seqncias rodadas nos destroos do Titanic so estupendas, mas o filme constantemente perde o foco e gasta muito tempo com a narrao pouco inspirada de Paxton.", "Cameron is forever associated with the fateful ship, and I think it's time he moved on.", "Not as record setting a motion picture as, say, \"Titanic,\" but more haunting and ethereal.", "Granted, if I'd made a film that grossed more than $600 million in the U.S. and walked away with 11 Academy Awards, I'd probably be a bit slow on the upbeat myself.", "Ghosts Of the Abyss is an interesting experiment which fails to take full advantage of the real opportunity granted in its inception - to utilize emerging technology to explore terrain that has never been witnessed by humans. . .", "The Titanic has a haunting beauty that is served well by the movie's 3-dimensional process."], "rating": ["", "B+", "8/10", "3.5/5", "6/10", "", "", "", "", "2/5", "", "4.5/5", "1.5/4", "6/10", "3/5", "2.5/4", "3/4", "3.5/4", "", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Alexander Walker", "Steven D.
