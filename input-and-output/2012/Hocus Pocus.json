{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After moving to Salem, Mass., teenager Max Dennison (Omri Katz) explores an abandoned house with his sister Dani (Thora Birch) and their new friend, Allison (Vinessa Shaw). After dismissing a story Allison tells as superstitious, Max accidentally frees a coven of evil witches (Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kathy Najimy) who used to live in the house. Now, with the help of a magical cat, the kids must steal the witches' book of spells to stop them from becoming immortal.", "rating": "38", "genre": "Comedy/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Kenny Ortega", "studio": "WaltDisneyPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 23, 2015", "box_office": "$4.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["More \"trick\" than \"treat.\"", "Disney goes queer (and camp!) with Kenny Ortega's Hocus Pocus. thanks to the divine performances of its three leading ladies.", "It continues to grow new fandom with each Halloween, partly because its family friendly, witches are timeless characters, and it's instantly quotable given the over-the-top performances by Midler, Najimy, and Parker.", "Not even the CGI effects held any awe.", "For its target audience of children and young teenagers, this Halloween blend of comedy, fantasy, and mild horror is wonderfully effective.", "So... I love this movie", "I f*cking love this movie!", "...an appealingly old-school Disney comedy.", "It's a veritable bagful of box office treats.", "It's ok but nothing special", "Disney's Hocus Pocus, if frequently saccharine, at least has the power to engage the viewer.", "The sheer glut of stuff has the terrible effect of wrecking the pacing, making the not-egregiously-long movie feel substantially more than in its running time.", "A movie perfectly matched for pre-Lizzie McGuire tweens looking for something to watch on cable around Halloween while their older siblings were in the basement watching Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees split heads.", "An unscary, unfunny game of kids vs. kitschy witches.", "They probably should have left this misfire in the broom closet -- with the other wooden vehicles.", "This is one of the oddest releases of the summer, and it's hard to imagine it finding a broad audience. With the rather ghoulish deaths of children depicted, it's certainly too strong for very young moviegoers.", "Forget amusement parks and hockey teams.
