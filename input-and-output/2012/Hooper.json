{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Sonny Hooper (Burt Reynolds) is getting too banged up to remain Hollywood's top stuntman, but he signs up as the stunt coordinator for a big-budget action movie with a pushy director (Robert Klein) and a clueless star (Adam West).

And Hal Needham's direction and stunt staging are wonderfully crafted.", "Director Needham (an ex-stuntman himself) slips effortlessly into a lightweight satire of the movie biz and an almost Hawksian action-comedy of male-group professionalism.", "A highly entertaining tribute to Hollywood stuntmen. The best of the Burt Reynolds-Hal Needham collaborations.", "", "", "Mr. Reynolds has made a movie to please fans of all persuasions, and to please them a great deal.", "Slight yet likable stuntman comedy.", "Guilty pleasure stunt-guy flick. Worth it for the final stunt of the film.", "Any film with Robert Klein as the villain can't be all bad", "Director Needham had graduated from being a stuntman to direct Smokey and the Bandit, but you would have to dig deep to find any great insight into the trade.", "", "", "A lot of people and things are variously punched and smashed, and a good time is had by all."], "rating": ["", "", "1/5", "", "", "3.5/4", "3/5", "2/5", "", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "", "1/5", "2/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Arthur Knight", "Gary Arnold", "", "Variety Staff", "Paul Taylor", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "Emanuel Levy", "Lori Hoffman", "Janet Maslin", "Scott Weinberg", "Widgett Walls", "Jon Niccum", "", "James Rocchi", "Jeffrey Westhoff", "Dave Kehr"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fantastica Daily", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Atlantic City Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Needcoffee.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lawrence Journal-World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Netflix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Northwest Herald (Crystal Lake, IL)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader"], "date": ["August 7, 2018", "February 2, 2016", "February 2, 2016", "March 26, 2009", "June 24, 2006", "January 30, 2006", "July 31, 2005", "July 28, 2005", "May 9, 2005", "April 17, 2005", "April 1, 2005", "June 6, 2003", "May 24, 2003", "November 7, 2002", "October 10, 2002", "January 1, 2000"]}}
