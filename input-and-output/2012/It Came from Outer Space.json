After investigating the crater from the impact, John informs the town sheriff (Charles Drake), and receives nothing but ridicule. Even his fianc\u00e9e, Ellen (Barbara Rush), is skeptical. All that changes when the townsfolk start disappearing, and are replaced by eerie alien duplicates.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Classics/Horror/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 21m", "director": "Jack Arnold", "studio": "UniversalInternationalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 10, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Except for the gimmick value of fairly good 3-D photography and the reassuring thought that other planets may not want to destroy Earth, this is a quite conventional specimen of science fiction on the screen.", "If anything, a modern vantage point reaffirms how devastatingly the film hits the nail on the head.", "Despite the lurid title and the involvement of several genre regulars, It Came from Outer Space is hardly a typical 'Fifties sci-fi movie.", "Among top five of 1950s sci-fi classics, starring great effects along with Richard Carlson.", "Picture has been smartly fashioned to take advantage of all the tricks of science-fiction and 3-D.", "One of the better science-fiction films to come out of the Cold War 50s, this one must be counted among the anti-McCarthy statements.", "[A] scary black-and-white SF effort from 1953.", "", "Merely mildly diverting, not stupendous.", "Conta com uma temtica rica que, ao contrrio de boa parte de seus contemporneos, usa os aliengenas no como metfora para a ameaa comunista, mas para condenar o preconceito.", "The 3-D process leaves the image somewhat murky, but you can discern sparks of authentic pulp poetry throughout.", "", "", "Good, old-fashioned drive-in fun.", "", "", "Surprisingly good '50s alien invasion flick with giant eyeballs -- maintains its charm despite the lack of 3-D effects on most video copies.", "", "", ""], "rating": ["", "5/5", "", "4/5", "", "3.5/4", "", "2/5", "2.5/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "2/5", "3/5", "1/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Clyde Gilmour", "Rob Humanick", "James O&#39;Ehley", "Steve Crum", "", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Jake Euker", "A.H.
