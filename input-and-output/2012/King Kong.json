{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Peter Jackson's expansive remake of the 1933 classic follows director Carl Denham (Jack Black) and his crew on a journey from New York City to the ominous Skull Island to film a new movie. Accompanying him are playwright Jack Driscoll (Adrien Brody) and actress Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts), who is whisked away by the monstrous ape, Kong, after they reach the island. The crew encounters dinosaurs and other creatures as they race to rescue Ann, while the actress forms a bond with her simian captor.", "rating": "84", "genre": "Action & Adventure", "runtime": "3h 7m", "director": "Peter Jackson", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "Dec 14, 2005", "dvd_date": "Oct 1, 2015", "box_office": "$218.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Some sequences are less convincing than others, but the technology has improved to such a degree that it's undeniably impressive to see Kong during his most famous routines.", "In an era of reduced expectations, King Kong is one movie where everyone, studio and audience, gets their money's worth.", "Jackson takes a slow and methodical approach to the story, with Kong not appearing until over an hour into the film. But like that first climb on a rollercoaster, once the action picks up steam, it is nonstop.", "From start to finish, this is an extravaganza, a classic and a love story that you will long hold in the palm of your hand as Kong holds us in his.", "Who would have thought a remake of one of the greatest films ever could rival, if not surpass, the original? In Jackson's capable hands, that's just what King Kong does.", "From dinosaur stampedes to tooth-and-claw fights with Tyrannosaurs to the titular ape's inevitable, doomed climb up the Empire State Building, Kong Version 3.0 is the very definition of spectacle cinema.", "It's a pity that the film is such a miserable slog to start off, because the second that it arrives on Skull Island, it suddenly explodes into life.", "It clocks in at over three hours, but Peter Jackson's remake of the 1933 classic is gripping nonetheless.", "As it is a remake, it doesn't have the shock Lord Of The Rings possessed upon its release, but this is a beautiful beast of a B-movie, thrilling and touching.", "The movie is a good cautionary example of what happens when its maker is too close to the material, who can't see the forest for the trees, the story for the ape.", "Fails to match the simple, handmade artistry of the original", "A solid action film and okay remake.", "Peter Jackson's remake of the 1933 classic is a loving homage that recreates and updates many of the familiar sequences... Unfortunately, the recreation leaves one wondering what, exactly, the point of the film is, other than indulging the director...", "Every now and then, an undertaking like Kong comes around, and it underscores the truly extraordinary accomplishment of directing a film.", "It takes a while to get everybody to Skull Island, about 70 minutes, but it's time extremely well-spent.", "Kong is not without its flaws, but sometimes you just have to throw your hands up in the air, wave them like you just don't care, scream at the top of your lungs and just go with the rollercoaster ride, that's what this film is.", "Overlong by half, hedonistically animated and decadently self-indulgent King Kong is beastly to be sure, but there is little beauty here.", "A bit more time in the editing room could've lifted it into great blockbuster territory. instead we've got a sporadically entertaining escapade that never captures our hearts like it so desperately wants too.", "Kong is a showy, state-of-the-art popcorn movie, faithful to the spirit of the 1933 original but generously adrenalized with the best effects money can buy.", "I wish Jackson would shake off his addiction to gigantism, his apparent need to punch everything up three times as much as it needs to be."], "rating": ["6/10", "", "B+", "5/5", "4/4", "", "3/5", "", "4/5", "2/4", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "A", "4/10", "", "", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Chris McCoy", "Micheal Compton", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Matthew Lucas", "Zaki Hasan", "Tim Brayton", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Film4 Staff", "Jay Antani", "Fernando F.
