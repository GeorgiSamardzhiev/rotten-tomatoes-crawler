{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After deciding to sell their zoo in India and move to Canada, Santosh and Gita Patel board a freighter with their sons and a few remaining animals. Tragedy strikes when a terrible storm sinks the ship, leaving the Patels' teenage son, Pi (Suraj Sharma), as the only human survivor. However, Pi is not alone; a fearsome Bengal tiger has also found refuge aboard the lifeboat. As days turn into weeks and weeks drag into months, Pi and the tiger must learn to trust each other if both are to survive.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "2h 5m", "director": "Ang Lee", "studio": "HaishangFilms,GilNetter", "theater_date": "Nov 21, 2012", "dvd_date": "Jul 31, 2014", "box_office": "$125.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["In my view, people who find no drama in everyday life and lives, and feel obliged, for example, to ski down Mount Everest to keep themselves occupied and excited, are not to be trusted about important matters.", "Why must bitter reality always rear its ugly head in such parables?", "Suraj Sharma gives a performance that exudes both boyish charm and a soulful desperation.", "Giving Ang Lee access to 3D camera equipment and a modern-day fable like \"Life of Pi\" is the best idea anyone has had in a long time.", "I have certainly seen dramas about survivors; but none, absolutely none that I have seen compare to the spectacular Life of Pi. [Full review in Spanish]", "Among its many virtues, this beautiful fable of a teen boy holding a grown tiger at bay for 277 days at sea makes a strong case for the superiority of live-action drama over animation...", "...in the end, we must abandon ourselves to the storytelling. With a gorgeous film like Life of Pi, that's not hard to do.", "Although certain narrative themes seem overblown or loaded with fallacious simplicity, film is a visual medium at heart and LIFE OF PI is the work of a visual storyteller at the top of his game.", "In a rare alignment of artistic vision and blockbuster ambition, Life of Pi stretches the horizon of cinema's new technology to restore old-fashioned movie magic.", "Lee imbues the film with remarkable grace, even when its imagery threatens to overwhelm it.", "This is a strong piece of filmmaking from Lee, an exquisite bit of eye candy that examines the power of God and religion in a sharp and confident manner.", "A boy, and a tiger, and a vast, endless ocean. Ang Lee makes a film out of material that seems almost unfilmable, and a lot of it is quite wondrous.", "Ultimately, Life of Pi as film is a visual complement to Yann Martel's story as opposed to a fresh telling of its own", "Life of Pi is beautifully rendered with some fine performances. Unfortunately, this novel deemed by many to be 'unfilmable' ultimately proves to at least partially earn that distinction.", "Lee has successfully married some of this year's most sumptuous visuals with one of its most compelling and unashamedly spiritual stories.", "The visuals and special effects are imaginatively exquisite.", "Any old actor will tell you to never share the stage with children or animals. Certainly, that is the case here, as the film is almost exclusively child and animal -- and wonderful.", "While you are bathing in all the beauty, you are waiting and waiting and waiting for this film to say something, yet when it finally does... it all just feels empty somehow.", "It's harder to explain why the movie doesn't leave the audience feeling more impressed. Perhaps the lessons on religion and philosophy were a bit too overblown. Sometimes a tiger is just a tiger, after all.", "Lee shows his hero's imperilled position as a mixed blessing. By tottering on the ledge of his mortality, Pi gains a front-row seat on the miracles of creation... All this is, in a word, Awesome."], "rating": ["", "5/10", "3.5/4", "B+", "9/10", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "3.5/5", "", "3.5/5", "5/5", "", "8/10", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Brent McKnight", "Yasser Medina", "David Lamble", "Kathi Maio", "Jim Ross", "Brian D.
