{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this biographical film, glamorous yet lonely star Joan Crawford (Faye Dunaway) takes in two orphans, and at first their unconventional family seems happy. But after Joan's attempts at romantic fulfillment go sour and she is fired from her contract with MGM studios, her callous and abusive behavior towards her daughter Christina (Diana Scarwid) becomes even more pronounced. Christina leaves home and takes her first acting role, only to find her mother's presence still overshadowing her.", "rating": "49", "genre": "Drama/Special Interest", "runtime": "2h 9m", "director": "Frank Perry", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "Sep 18, 1981", "dvd_date": "Jun 6, 2014", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The movie is confusing and boring... Faye Dunaway does a decent job, but is incapable of overcoming the weakness of the book and the script. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Mommie Dearest becomes a kind of homage to the monster herself -- the emotions are so splendid, the scenes so dramatic, the experiences so incandescent.", "Lacking psychological intelligence or, for that matter, awareness of Hollywood sociology, Mommie Dearest is just a collection of screechy scenes further distanced by convictionless direction.", "This is lavish and pretty accurate as far as Hollywood lore is concerned, but Dunaway makes Norma Desmond look like Doris Day.", "Mara Hobel and Diana Scarwid are wonderful playing Christina the child and the adult... but it's Dunaway, greedily attacking her role, who proves most riveting. In this glossy, gaudy Hollywood kind of movie, she makes her very own kind of truth.", "With its hysterical sessions of psychological (and occasionally physical) torment, the movie is so wretchedly written and flatly constructed that it's easy to regard as a misguided horror flick.", "The flaws aren't the story with this unusual film. The story is in the powerful, vivid and emotionally draining scenes of torment and conflict between a mother and daughter.", "Mommie Dearest is a work created out of pain, but by the time it gets to the screen the audience is laughing at its heroine's pathetic -- and potentially violent -- outbursts.", "\"Mommie Dearest,\" the film version of Christina Crawford's poison-pen memoir of her adoptive mother, Joan Crawford, looms as wretched excess.", "The character is rendered such a grotesque, its moments don't accumulate to an arc or even a readable profile. They just pile up, like cars in a traffic accident, and all we can do is gawk.", "Campy skewering of Hollywood star is both silly and sad.", "Trashy soap opera drama on the private life of screen queen Joan Crawford.", "By all accounts, Miss Crawford had serious failings as a mother, but the film pounds so unrelentingly on her raging cruelty to her children -- and her equally offensive public sweetness -- that she emerges as a laughable caricature.", "Director Frank Perry simply sits back and lets Dunaway rip. He was either supremely untalented or he purposefully intended to sabotage her.", "Wire Hangers!", "Dunaway creates the benchmark for harridans the world over but never entirely loses sympathy for her subject. It's a constant blast of high melodrama and camp.", "It's rich, stimulating thought in spite of itself.", "Director Frank Perry, who collaborated with three others (including producer Frank Yablans) on the script, gives it all a certain crazed conviction.", "Joan Crawford (Dunaway, in a remarkable makeup job) comes off as a cartoon monster in this over-the-top biopic, which blithely mixes fact, legend, and -- especially --elements of Crawford's unique screen persona.", "Dunaway does not chew scenery. Dunaway starts neatly at each corner of the set in every scene and swallows it whole, costars and all."], "rating": ["", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "B-", "", "1.5/4", "4/4", "", "", "", "2.5/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Diego Gal\u00e1n", "Peter Ackroyd", "Richard Schickel", "Adrian Turner", "People Staff", "David Sterritt", "Bruce McCabe", "Rick Chatenever", "Gary Arnold", "Jason Bailey", "Tracy Moore", "Dennis Schwartz", "Yardena Arar", "Josh Larsen", "Stefan Birgir Stefansson", "Film4 Staff", "Dave Kehr", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "TV Guide Staff", "Variety Staff"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Globe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Santa Cruz Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flavorwire", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">sbs.is", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety"], "date": ["August 26, 2019", "June 3, 2019", "December 11, 2018", "December 11, 2018", "December 11, 2018", "December 11, 2018", "April 27, 2018", "October 4, 2017", "October 4, 2017", "October 15, 2016", "October 13, 2015", "February 20, 2013", "July 6, 2010", "May 13, 2008", "February 28, 2008", "October 30, 2007", "October 30, 2007", "October 30, 2007", "October 30, 2007", "October 30, 2007"]}}
