{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Having concluded a case, detective Hercule Poirot (Albert Finney) settles into what he expects will be a relaxing journey home aboard the Orient Express. But when an unpopular billionaire is murdered en route, Poirot takes up the case, and everyone on board the famous train is a suspect. Using an avalanche blocking the tracks to his advantage, Poirot gradually realizes that many of the passengers have revenge as a motive, and he begins to home in on the culprit.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 7m", "director": "Sidney Lumet", "studio": "EMIFilmsLtd.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 20, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Murder on the Orient Express is that unusual thing; an inflated trifle that actually works.", "For the first time Christie's social world is recreated in all of its splendor and romance.", "Lumet is as careful in showing things we don't know are important yet as he is hiding those we know are.", "The secret of this film is style.", "Its aspirations are admirable; unfortunately, the final film is a heavy-handed misadventure that fizzles flat like day-old champagne.", "Lumet has assembled the most glamorous cast since Grand Hotel, and acting like a traffic manager in Heaven, allowed each of his stars a few moments upon the stage.", "Regardless of the dust that covers its brilliance, this is a mystery film absolutely worth re-jumping on board for.", "The idea is that everything will be more interesting if Sean Connery or Ingrid Bergman, rather than the characters they play, is suspected of having committed the foul deed. The device does not work, despite the [actors'] occasionally droll efforts.", "This is easily the best screen adaptation of an Agatha Christie whodunnit and, for those unfamiliar with either book or film, the solution will take your breath away.", "As with all Agatha Christie stories, the solution to the mystery is rather ingenious.
