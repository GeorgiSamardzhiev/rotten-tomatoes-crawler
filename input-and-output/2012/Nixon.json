Nixon is seen as a child born to austere Quaker parents, as a young attorney wooing his future wife, Pat (Joan Allen), and as an astute but dour politician. After finally becoming president, Nixon is embroiled in the infamous Watergate scandal.", "rating": "74", "genre": "Documentary/Drama", "runtime": "3h 10m", "director": "Oliver Stone", "studio": "CinergiPicturesEntertainment,IllusionEntertainment,HollywoodPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 19, 2016", "box_office": "$13.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Stone had just come off of his blast of overcooked insanity Natural Born Killers, and he applies some of that rebellious invention to this otherwise sober undertaking.", "Stone's newfound timidity in both style and content -- this appeared after a 10-year stretch that included the high-powered likes of Platoon, JFK and Natural Born Killers -- marked it as the beginning of the end of a remarkable run.", "", "Dense psychodrama of much-disliked U.S. president.", "You could say that Nixon is Oliver Stone's Citizen Kane, and not necessarily mean it as praise.", "The filmmaker's deftness at evoking theme and sentiment through editorial montages within individual dramatic scenes reaches an apotheosis here.", "It's clear that Stone hates Nixon with a capital H.", "A convincing blend of Shakespearean tragedy and Citizen Kane, Nixon paints the thirty-seventh President of the United States as a uniquely American tragic hero...[Blu-Ray]", "Some of Nixon's scenes are standouts, but it's Hopkins' crazy rants that you won't forget.", "A staggering work of empathy for Stone.", "As wayward and self-regarding as its subject, the film long overstays its welcome.", "The combination of Oliver Stone and Richard Nixon, two paranoids from opposite ends of the political spectrum, is a match made in cinematic heaven.", "For all its unwieldy temporal scope and narrowness of perspective, Nixon is an amazingly graceful beast, flawed yet invigorating, packed with enough material that will fascinate and irk moviegoers of all stripes for quite a time to come.", "A riveting tragedy.", "A hulking tyrannosaur of a movie, lusty and fierce, crashing around for all the world to see, majestic in its size and scope though it's also an instant anachronism.", "", "", "", "", ""], "rating": ["4/4", "2.5/4", "A", "3/5", "", "A-", "1.5/5", "4/4", "3.5/5", "3.5/4", "", "1", "2.5/5", "4/4", "A-", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jeffrey M.
