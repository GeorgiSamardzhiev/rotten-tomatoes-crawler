It's bloated, drawn-out and has no idea how to provide a single scare.", "A lack of originality does hold the film back, but with decent work behind the camera and a breakneck finale, Paranormal Activity 4 is still a solid watch if you've an evening spare, or horror film night coming up.", "It's a strong and creepy expansion of the mythos, but one that could have used a lot more work in the story department.", "The eerie inertia and starkness of the past films' imagery are mostly gone here, and that style is what had set this series apart for me.", "Little depth or subtext here. It's tough to care about the fate of a generic, whitebread family and its blonde-in-distress living in an airless, gated-community Nevada. We've seen the creepy kid and freaked-out teens in countless fear-fests before.", "The chills are centered at the end of 'Paranormal Activity 4.'
