{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When former CIA agent Jack Ryan (Harrison Ford) hampers an IRA terrorist attack in London, he kills one of the terrorists. The dead man's brother, another member of the group named Sean Miller (Sean Bean), is arrested but quickly escapes. Vowing revenge against Ryan, Miller travels to the United States, where he forces Ryan's wife (Anne Archer) and daughter (Thora Birch) into a car accident that badly injures them. This convinces Ryan to rejoin the CIA in order to track down Miller.", "rating": "73", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "Phillip Noyce", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$82.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["More modern than its predecessor and certainly more intense, this competent follow-up is, almost inarguably, the best Jack Ryan entry of the series.", "A very good film that's overshadowed by being a sequel to a perfect one, Patriot Games is interesting for swapping out lead actors for very different takes on the same character in the middle of a trilogy.", "...a thoroughly engrossing and often impressively exciting thriller...", "manages the action with verve and efficiency while also giving the film a more nuanced emotional sensibility, emphasizing Ryan as a father who above all wants to protect his family, not save the world", "The film is too fancy and not sufficiently harsh.", "Much of Patriot Games is routine: good guys and bad guys running around with heavy artillery. But at its best moments, Noyce and Ford snap the genre back to life.", "Patriot Games is a good laugh, and a good look at Harrison Ford, and any connection with political truth, or with the real layout of London, is entirely coincidental.", "It flounders from one absurdity to another, with results that are hilarious when they aren't insulting. There is as much political realism in the film as there is in Naked Gun 2 1/2, except that in Patriot Games it matters.", "Spy thriller mixes nonstop violence with pro-family message.", "It's Ford and Patriot Games that made Jack Ryan a top-notch action hero and not just a capable CIA nerd.", "Although it simplifies global conflict to make a swift impression, the intrigue maintains a pop and the inner fires still burn bright. Baldwin is missed, yet Ford finds his place in the franchise quickly and efficiently.", "", "While Ford is a solid blend of thought and action in his James Bondish role, and his need to protect his family gives the film some gripping moments, the film's moral viewpoint is strictly neanderthal.", "Ford gives one of his most commanding performances outside of a Lucas production, establishing an action formula Ford would repeat...[Blu-Ray]", "", "", "The film's dominant motif is that of revenge. In a key scene, the wife tells her husband (Harrison Ford): You get him. I don't care what you have to do, just get him.\" From that point on, the film becomes the story of a nuclear family in imminent danger.", "", "", ""], "rating": ["8/10", "4.5/5", "3.5/4", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "7/10", "B", "C+", "", "3/4", "5/5", "4/5", "B-", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Christopher Lloyd", "David Nusair", "James Kendrick", "Vanessa Letts", "David Ansen", "Anthony Lane", "Adam Mars-Jones", "Tracy Moore", "Tim Brayton", "Brian Orndorf", "Owen Gleiberman", "Joseph McBride", "Peter Canavese", "David Kaplan", "Susan Granger", "Emanuel Levy", "Greg Maki", "Rebecca Murray", "Robin Clifford"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Yap", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Q Network Film Desk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">BrianOrndorf.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Groucho Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Kaplan vs. Kaplan", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">www.susangranger.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Star-Democrat (Easton, MD)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">About.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reeling Reviews"], "date": ["September 24, 2020", "June 2, 2020", "August 24, 2019", "September 17, 2018", "July 25, 2018", "February 9, 2018", "January 4, 2018", "November 15, 2017", "May 27, 2014", "January 18, 2014", "June 4, 2012", "September 7, 2011", "October 30, 2008", "August 6, 2008", "March 1, 2008", "October 2, 2007", "October 7, 2006", "July 2, 2006", "November 10, 2005", "November 19, 2004"]}}
