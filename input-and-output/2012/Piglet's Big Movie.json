{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this animated feature, Piglet (John Fiedler) is the smallest of all his friends, which doesn't account for his big heart and bold attitude. But, try as he might, Piglet cannot convey his personality to his friends -- not even to Winnie the Pooh (Jim Cummings) ! Piglet becomes fed up after being excluded from a honey-thieving scheme, so strikes out on his own to do some thinking. But when Piglet's friends discover he's missing, the only clue they have to go on is a scrapbook he left behind.", "rating": "70", "genre": "Animation/Kids & Family/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 15m", "director": "Francis Glebas", "studio": "BuenaVista(WaltDisney)", "theater_date": "Mar 21, 2003", "dvd_date": "May 5, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It just doesn't feel like a theatrical release.", "Not very interesting, imaginative, or exciting.", "The screenplay by Brian Hohlfeld incorporates three of the original Pooh stories but captures none of the charm of A.A.

Most moppets should love the characters and incidents.", "It may be Piglet's Big Movie, but it's a very minor entry in the Disney canon.", "While young children are still likely to be entranced seeing their beloved characters up on the big screen, it never comes close to touching the child inside the grownups. And that's the real mistake.", "O filme cativa por sua simplicidade.", "Its simplicity and lack of motive makes Piglet's Big Movie succeed.", "It's a pleasure to let yourself feel no irony, no cynicism, nothing really but a sort of lulling contentment as you learn of the adventures had by a plucky little Piglet with a heart as big as anything.", "Bother! Or, rather, why bother?", "", "Piglet's Big Movie is an agreeable, if fitfully entertaining, introduction to Milne's characters.
