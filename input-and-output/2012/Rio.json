{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Captured by smugglers when he was just a hatchling, a macaw named Blu (Jesse Eisenberg) never learned to fly and lives a happily domesticated life in Minnesota with his human friend, Linda. Blu is thought to be the last of his kind, but when word comes that Jewel (Anne Hathaway), a lone female, lives in Rio de Janeiro, Blu and Linda go to meet her. Animal smugglers kidnap Blu and Jewel, but the pair soon escape and begin a perilous adventure back to freedom -- and Linda.", "rating": "72", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Animation/Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "Carlos Saldanha", "studio": "BlueSkyStudios", "theater_date": "Apr 15, 2011", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["With Blu and Jewel chained together (like the hero and heroine of The 39 Steps), there are thrills, spills and gags galore.", "This is one film that you won't necessarily regret paying the extra bucks for the extra bursts of color and animation.", "I found it quite charming.", "I've never heard an adult say, \"I must go see that film. It has Jesse Eisenberg's voice in it.\" They could have spent the money on something else, like a better story.", "This isn't revolutionary animation, but it's warm, sincere and huge-hearted.
