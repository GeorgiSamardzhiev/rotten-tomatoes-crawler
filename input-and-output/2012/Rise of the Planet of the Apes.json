{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Will Rodman (James Franco), a scientist in San Francisco, is experimenting with a drug that he hopes will cure his father's (John Lithgow) Alzheimer's disease. After his work is deemed a failure, Will becomes the guardian of Caesar, an infant chimp who was exposed in-utero to Will's drug. Caesar displays unusual intelligence, and Will decides to continue his experiments secretly. But as Caesar's intellect and abilities grow, he comes to represent a threat to man's dominion over Earth.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Rupert Wyatt", "studio": "CherninEntertainment", "theater_date": "Aug 5, 2011", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$176.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's unfortunate that the use of nothing but computer-generated monkeys still can't fool the human eye, never appearing entirely believable in movement or appearance.", "While the human performances convince, it is Peter Jackson's Oscar-winning Weta Digital that really advances the film.", "Every now and again, a film comes out and totally surprises you. Rise of the Planet of the Apes is one of those films.", "A breath of fresh air, not only in the world of summer movies, but as a reboot in general.", "Could have easily rested on the CGI and action and been a satisfying film, but there is heart and soul here, too -- thanks to Caesar, a fully fleshed-out and complex character.", "It is frustrating in places, but overall, it's entertaining and even somewhat moving.", "The film looks good -- Caesar is a real character, not simply a futuristic fantasy created to prove a point.", "Perhaps the most brilliant narrative move in a host of brilliant narrative moves executed by Rise of the Planet of the Apes is that it's an \"end of the world\" movie that manages to make us forget it's an \"end of the world\" movie.", "When the apes get smart, it's pretty thrilling...may this be the first of many Uprising Movies, and may they give us all some practical ideas for future use.", "The kids have to go back to school soon enough, and Rise of the Planet of the Apes offers one last shot at some great summer fun.", "A visual treat that should remind audiences just why they love to see summer blockbusters - because every now and then they are both enjoyable and well-made films.", "Rise of the Planet of the Apes is one of those rare films that, like its ape protagonist, comes from humble stock but manages to exceed expectations profoundly.", "Paced like a rocket but de-politicized and de-poeticized, adorned with sprawling camera movements yet trapped in shallow screen space, the film clomps through with a flatness that makes its vision of the beginning of mankind's end seem weirdly soothing.", "The story has big ideas but is underwritten, the acting is pedestrian at best, and though the CGI apes are very well actualized, they still look cartoony at times.", "Rupert Wyatt delivers on the giddy pleasures - climbing, leaping, swinging, plus the irresistable high of an upward-rushing learning curve.", "It's a surprisingly provocative film that really stretches the definition of summer blockbuster.", "Rise of the Planet of the Apes is simian cinema at its best.", "Apes is one of the better political films I've seen lately, and its arrival in theatre is oddly timely, given current events.", "You can tell me all day that this is great, Avatar-like use of animation. I'll even grant the point. But though I was engaged in the first half of the film, this action section left me looking at my watch.", "With little dialogue but a world of emotion in his face, eyes and body, [Andy Serkis] not only keeps us on our toes but also has us rooting for the apes to trounce humanity."], "rating": ["5/10", "3.5/4", "4/5", "3/4", "A", "B", "3/5", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "3/5", "B+", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Matthew Lucas", "Micheal Compton", "Abbie Bernstein", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Zaki Hasan", "Eileen Jones", "Megan Basham", "Joseph Walsh", "Annalee Newitz", "Fernando F.
