{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Though the South Pacific's Esa-ala Caves are some of the least-accessible on Earth, expert diver Frank McGuire (Richard Roxburgh) has explored them for months. On one such expedition, Frank is joined by his teenage son, Josh (Rhys Wakefield), and financier Carl Hurley (Ioan Gruffudd). When a flash flood cuts off their exit, they are caught in a life-or-death situation.

Only those moments are far too few and far between.", "Sanctum has on its plus side stunning settings and excellent use of the 3D process [but] that dimensionality doesn't go very far with the characters.", "An enjoyable if formulaic film.", "Coupled with Frank's borderline sociopathic 'survival of the fittest' philosophy and his son Rhys Wakefield's bland sulkiness, there's not one likeable character to care about when things go wrong.", "I couldn't wait for these people to drown.", "While Sanctum isn't a great film, it's enjoyable for the thrilling element.", "The strong special effects can't overcome the story's sour focus on pain and hopelessness.", "Mixed in with flat characters and tense action is an incredible 3D visual component - which is where Cameron's involvement in the project is most apparent.", "It's a continuing clash between laughably poor acting and ultra-serious brow-furrowing that renders Sanctum unintentionally hilarious, thereby deflating it completely.", "The film's lack of a decent story, character development, and performances, as well as its emotional hollowness, make it not worth the time in any format.", "Its downfall is its clich-riddled and fusty script.", "Often feels like James Cameron just playing around with some very expensive bathtub toys -- and treading water until his Avatar sequel comes out next year.", "Seriously, you'll find yourself more emotionally and viscerally involved by sticking some Lego men in a water filled blender and watching them go round and round.", "The tension is difficult to be felt with such flat characters.", "...a well-intentioned yet utterly misguided underwater thriller.", "Lacks the Titanic appeal of a James Cameron \"event\" movie", "The script is pretty lackluster."], "rating": ["6/10", "2.0/4", "C-", "C", "B-", "3/5", "1/5", "", "3/5", "2.0/5", "3/5", "2/5", "1.5/4", "", "2/5", "1/5", "3/10", "2/4", "", "2.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "Brent McKnight", "Abbie Bernstein", "Kaleem Aftab", "Roe McDermott", "Sean Burns", "Kevin Carr", "John Hanlon", "Ben Kendrick", "Ali Gray", "Jeff Beck", "Leah Rozen", "Neil Pond", "Ben Rawson-Jones", "Mike Barnard", "David Nusair", "Robert Denerstein", "Grae Drake"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Assignment X", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The List", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hot Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">7M Pictures", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Big Hollywood", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen Rant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheShiznit.co.uk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Examiner.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheWrap", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">American Profile", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Digital Spy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Future Movies UK", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Habit", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies.com"], "date": ["November 30, 2020", "September 21, 2020", "August 11, 2020", "July 13, 2020", "February 16, 2019", "November 6, 2018", "March 11, 2016", "May 3, 2015", "August 26, 2013", "June 30, 2013", "October 4, 2012", "September 28, 2012", "September 21, 2012", "October 7, 2011", "September 9, 2011", "July 14, 2011", "June 11, 2011", "June 5, 2011", "May 26, 2011", "May 13, 2011"]}}
