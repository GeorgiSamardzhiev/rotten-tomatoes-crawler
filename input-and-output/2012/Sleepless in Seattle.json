{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After the death of his wife, Sam Baldwin (Tom Hanks) moves to Seattle with his son, Jonah (Ross Mallinger). When Jonah calls in to a talk-radio program to find a new wife for his father, Sam grudgingly gets on the line to discuss his feelings. Annie Reed (Meg Ryan), a reporter in Baltimore, hears Sam speak and falls for him, even though she is engaged. Unsure where it will lead, she writes Sam a letter asking him to meet her at the Empire State Building on Valentine's Day.", "rating": "75", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Nora Ephron", "studio": "TriStarPictures", "theater_date": "Jun 25, 1993", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$125.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Despite a madcap, slapstick type of comic conclusion, with no real hope of marital longevity, the film is terribly romantic.", "Sleepless in Seattle finds a way to put a fresh seasoning on top of the genre.", "What are we teaching the other little sons of America, when they see so few movies as humane and woman-positive as Sleepless in Seattle, and so very many that portray women as evil incarnate?", "The emotional weight of the drama rests on Hanks, and you appreciate how skilfully Ephron structures the film so that the two principals are bound by song and sentiment rather than physical proximity.", "But the movie's problems go deeper-than the dialogue: its whole premise is flawed.", "Sleepless In Seattle balances romance and realism by giving its central characters two different but equally pragmatic philosophies on love.", "The rest of this romantic comedy about the strange power that pulls a man and woman together... only reinforces the notion that Ephron is a filmmaker whose time has come at last, after years as a novelist, screenwriter and feminist wit.", "\"Sleepless in Seattle\" (citywide), a real charmer, is a romantic comedy about an ultimate long-distance relationship.

I just don't like it when the movie does the welling up for you.", "A fairy tale that even teens can enjoy.", "A romantic treat.", "Mostly, Sleepless in Seattle leaves you feeling restless in the audience.", "If one can ignore all the straining for lightness here, this is watchable enough, though hardly anything resembling a tearjerker.", "Ephron and fellow writers Jeff Arch and David S.
