{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Stingo (Peter MacNicol), a young writer, moves to Brooklyn in 1947 to begin work on his first novel. As he becomes friendly with Sophie (Meryl Streep) and her lover Nathan (Kevin Kline), he learns that Sophie is a Holocaust survivor. Flashbacks reveal her harrowing story, from pre-war prosperity to Auschwitz. In the present, Sophie and Nathan's relationship increasingly unravels as Stingo grows closer to Sophie and Nathan's fragile mental state becomes ever more apparent.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 30m", "director": "Alan J.

Sophie's Choice, no matter how disturbing, remains muted.", "Streep and Kline, embodying their characters in a way that goes beyond performing, obliterate the excesses on their straight and stirring journey to the heart.", "The amazing intimacy Pakula creates with the audience ultimately makes Sophie's Choice the best film of the year.", "Whatever the film's weaknesses are, it is, albeit unsurprisingly, saved by Streep.", "I found myself more intrigued by the actress than moved by the character, fascinated by Meryl's \"choices\" rather than Sophie's Choice.", "...a cynical, too-slick-for-its-own-good bit of blatant awards-season filmmaking.", "The dramatic structure of the possible conflict lacks inspiration. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Streep's performance is outstanding.", "Sophie's Choice is a rare film, literate, deeply moving and gifted with an absolutely awe-inspiring performance by Meryl Streep.", "Tragic post-WWII tale has violence, death, and cursing.", "In other ways the film is just as unsatisfactory as the book, because it's inseparably strapped to basic flaws. The story has no center, no protagonist. To whom does the action of the novel happen?", "And while Meryl Streep's performance is largely worthy of its laurels ... the film around it is much harder to forgive. Beyond Streep, Sophie's Choice is little more than a tediously assembled WWII drama of interminable length.", "The way Streep inhabits Sophie, and brings her history to life whether she's explicitly talking about the past or carrying herself across the room with wounded grace, can't help but make parts of the rest of the film seem smaller by comparison.", "A suffocating 151 minutes long, with a healthy portion of that running time devoted to a hunk of Holocausploitation of the most crass and cynical variety. And that's the good part.", "Without Streep, Sophie's Choice would have been a very good motion picture. With her, it attains greatness.", "Stunning to the max, and Streep is memorable as Sophie.", "The movie is too Hollywood in look and feel, and the flashback and narration are too conventional, and yet the image of the sickly and pale Meryl Streep recollecting her ordeal lingers in memory long after the film is over.", "Competently directed by Pakula and [features] gorgeous cinematography by Almendros."], "rating": ["9/10", "4/5", "", "", "", "6/10", "", "1.5/4", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "C", "3.5/5", "4/10", "4/4", "5/5", "B", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "David Parkinson", "Leonard Klady", "People Staff", "Lawrence O&#39;Toole", "John Oursler", "Molly Haskell", "David Nusair", "Diego Gal\u00e1n", "Susan Shapiro", "Bob Thomas", "Renee Schonfeld", "Stanley Kauffmann", "Glenn Dunks", "Keith Phipps", "Tim Brayton", "James Berardinelli", "Steve Crum", "Emanuel Levy", ""], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Winnipeg Free Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Maclean&#39;s Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">PopMatters", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Vogue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sojourner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New Republic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Quickflix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dissolve", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ReelViews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Video-Reviewmaster.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide"], "date": ["September 7, 2020", "July 13, 2020", "July 13, 2020", "June 17, 2020", "June 17, 2020", "June 17, 2020", "February 26, 2020", "December 9, 2019", "August 28, 2019", "August 20, 2019", "November 12, 2018", "February 6, 2018", "January 9, 2018", "August 15, 2014", "April 29, 2014", "November 5, 2009", "April 30, 2009", "March 2, 2008", "December 10, 2007", "June 26, 2007"]}}
