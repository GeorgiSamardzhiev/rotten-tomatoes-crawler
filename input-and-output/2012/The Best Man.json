Lee is clearly a director to watch.", "See it twice!", "Lee's story, which rambles on for a good half-hour longer than is necessary, contains little we haven't already seen dozens of times at the movies.", "Fun to watch!"], "rating": ["3/4", "", "4/5", "", "3/5", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "2/5", "2.5/4", "", "3/5", "7", "5", "3.5/5", "5/5", "", "7/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Milton Kent", "Teresa Wiltz", "S.
