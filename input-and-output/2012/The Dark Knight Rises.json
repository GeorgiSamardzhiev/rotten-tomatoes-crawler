{"metadata": {"synopsis": "It has been eight years since Batman (Christian Bale), in collusion with Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman), vanished into the night. Assuming responsibility for the death of Harvey Dent, Batman sacrificed everything for what he and Gordon hoped would be the greater good. However, the arrival of a cunning cat burglar (Anne Hathaway) and a merciless terrorist named Bane (Tom Hardy) force Batman out of exile and into a battle he may not be able to win.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 45m", "director": "Christopher Nolan", "studio": "Syncopy", "theater_date": "Jul 20, 2012", "dvd_date": "Jan 7, 2014", "box_office": "$2"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A brilliant example, through Batman and a superhero lens, of the power of revolution as a national myth, and how it can come to define a society.", "Even with a twisting mystery and numerous new characters, the lengthy and overly complex plotline overshadows many of the more fascinating elements.", "It is the perfect film for what it needs to be.", "The Dark Knight Rises may not always \"click\" intellectually, but it delivers some of the most rousing emotional highs of Nolan's career.", "Here Christopher Nolan brilliantly closes the final chapter of one of the most amazing film trilogies of recent times. [Full review in Spanish]", "A GREAT FINAL for the trilogy. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The Dark Knight Rises delivers a satisfying and emotional conclusion to a trilogy which will go down in history as one of the best ever. This is Christopher Nolan's crowning achievement and a perfect Batman film.", "...RISES gives the finish Nolan's characters deserve, but to say it reaches the heights of [its predecessors] is predictably hard.", "This conceit feels somewhat stale this time around, but a fearsome turn by Hardy keeps the action taut and the film exciting.", "A work that tries to honour and conclude the trilogy's politicking on its slippery themes of civic responsibility versus the value of self-preservation.", "The Dark Knight Rises caps off the trilogy with a high but bittersweet note.", "So rousingly, so emotionally, and so incalculably gratifying.", "A sprawling, messy, thrillingly imperfect film that delivers on its promise to shock and awe the audience.", "There's hope for Gotham and that makes me happy!", "Isn't quite the game changer of the previous film. But it is still a dark and exhilarating epic, grounded in reality with a precise vision and craftsmanship that make it more than just another comic book movie.", "The Dark Knight Rises not only celebrates a caped \u00dcbermensch but is itself, as a commercial enterprise, something beyond good and evil.", "The ending is likely to have people talking, but there's no question that it's been set up properly.", "The Dark Knight Rises is the pinnacle of epic movie-making and its scale and grandeur are unprecedented in cinema history. Nolan's biggest achievement -- and the real star of his third Batman film -- is Gotham city itself.", "Director Christopher Nolan has created a perfect trilogy.", "Hardy, in a miraculous performance, manages to communicate the intelligence behind the muscle using just his voice."], "rating": ["5/5", "7/10", "3.5/4", "", "8/10", "", "5/5", "", "3.4/5", "3/5", "4.5/5", "5/5", "3.5/4", "B", "", "", "A-", "5/5", "", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tony Black", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Siddhant Adlakha", "Yasser Medina", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Josh Wilding", "Jim Ross", "David Harris", "PJ Nabarro", "Danielle Solzman", "Kate Rodger", "Matthew Lucas", "Rachel Wagner", "Micheal Compton", "J.
