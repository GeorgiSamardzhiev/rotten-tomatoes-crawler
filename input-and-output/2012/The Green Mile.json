{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Paul Edgecomb (Tom Hanks) walked the mile with a variety of cons. He had never encountered someone like John Coffey (Michael Clarke Duncan), a massive black man convicted of brutally killing a pair of young sisters. Coffey had the size and strength to kill anyone, but not the demeanor. Beyond his simple, naive nature and a deathly fear of the dark, Coffey seemed to possess a prodigious, supernatural gift. Paul began to question whether Coffey was truly guilty of murdering the two girls.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "3h 9m", "director": "Frank Darabont", "studio": "CastleRockEntertainment,DarkwoodsProductions,WarnerBrothers", "theater_date": "Dec 10, 1999", "dvd_date": "Aug 15, 2008", "box_office": "$136.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The simple fable can't stand such scrutiny. More pivotally, the weight given to each moment lends The Green Mile a ponderousness that works against the emotions the story seems to want to plug into.", "Unfortunately the movie can never shake the uncomfortable and trope-filled premise.", "Much of the three-hour movie takes place in the prison, but the resonant characterization, expansive plotting, and judicious use of exterior locations and flashbacks turn the walls into windows.", "Thoughtful, intelligent movie for older teens.", "...despite the clichs and stereotypes, the film's cast manages to lift it from the depths of the commonplace and make watching it enjoyable.", "How many blockbusters deal with that kind of grief?", "To more than a few viewers, this one will feel like a life sentence.", "Though the film drifts off down some long blind alleys, when Darabont exercises discipline the result is highly effective.", "Dotted with many fine moments, clotted with a few flabby ones.", "Overextending its welcome, Frank Darabont's film is the most commercially popular adaptation of a Stephen King novella, but it's also a slow, often dull prison drama.", "The supernatural elements carry an undeniable emotional charge, but the solution to the underlying murder mystery is disappointingly tidy and trite.", "Although The Green Mile is a satisfying and affecting movie, it's not The Shawshank Redemption -- not by a long shot.", "One of the best prison films ever made.", "Mr. Jingles was robbed! (no mouse-Oscar)", "This movie is being described as inspiring? To me it just seems morbid, melancholy, sad, and far too long.", "Of all the movies based on King novels, The Green Mile ranks near the top -- but below Darabont's first, The Shawshank Redemption.", "Three long hours of wind, an exercise in titanic self-importance intent on passing off klunky rhetoric as poignant drama.", "Darabont explores the range of human kindness and cruelty as he lovingly and patiently sculpts his large cast of characters against magnificent scenery.", "Hanks and the other guards' acting is impeccable as would be expected, but Duncan and his fellow prisoners are also disturbingly real.", "A deeply racist movie, though clearly none of the filmmakers thinks so... By the picture's end, we are asked to grasp electrocution as in some way an act of benevolence."], "rating": ["", "3/10", "", "4/5", "7/10", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "C+", "", "", "3.5/5", "", "C", "3.5/4", "1/4", "5/5", "4.5/5", "D-"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Kirk Honeycutt", "Rachel Wagner", "Lisa Alspector", "Nell Minow", "John J.
