{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In what was once North America, the Capitol of Panem maintains its hold on its 12 districts by forcing them each to select a boy and a girl, called Tributes, to compete in a nationally televised event called the Hunger Games. Every citizen must watch as the youths fight to the death until only one remains. District 12 Tribute Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) has little to rely on, other than her hunting skills and sharp instincts, in an arena where she must weigh survival against love.", "rating": "84", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 22m", "director": "Gary Ross", "studio": "ColorForce", "theater_date": "Mar 23, 2012", "dvd_date": "Sep 9, 2016", "box_office": "$408.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The world and the situation in which Katniss finds herself are ripe with possibilities for deeper commentary, but so many of those possibilities are dissipated as the reader or viewer becomes swept up in the steady piling up of corpses.", "Despite its intriguing, albeit recycled plotline, several plaguing elements eat away at the intensity and - perhaps more importantly - the believability.", "The Hunger Games isn't a masterpiece, but it is far better than what most likely expected from the film.", "The Hunger Games is a fantasy spectacle that energetically takes over your eyes and leaves you hungry for more \"games\" and its strange dystopian future.. [Full review in Spanish]", "It doesn't leave any room for virtuosity and is about as literal and unsurprising a visual realisation of the story as you can get.", "Although the casting of a relative unknown like Jennifer Lawrence in the crucial role of Katniss was a bit controversial, in the hindsight of her Oscar win and status as hottest young thing in Hollywood, the choice seems brilliant.", "THE HUNGER GAMES has made its mark and, despite its issues, is a more interesting and admirable one than the 12A audience has been offered in some time.", "It's a bit of a thrill to see a bow-hunting girl nursing and defending her man, a good enough takeaway on its own to recommend The Hunger Games to both kids and the parents who drive them to the movies.", "Jennifer Lawrence is engaging as Katniss; indifferent to the circumstances and determined to survive, you end up admiring her spunk and defiance to The Man.", "Are you hungry yet? I hope so because with The Hunger Games you are in for a seven course meal with all the trimmings, guaranteed to satisfy even the most ravenous fan.", "At its best The Hunger Games is a taut thriller, an edge-of-your-seat ride once the actual games begin.", "Jennifer Lawrence is superb, with an unflinching gaze that's like a powerful alloy of fear and defiance.", "A beautiful, deeply affecting, and riveting film with a heroine for the ages.", "The odds are in its favor to please its hard-core devotees and newcomers alike.", "The Hunger Games is undeniably progressive in making its protagonist so plucky, independent, and self-actualizing a young woman.", "The Hunger Games is good, moves adroitly and holds our attention. It just doesn't fire the imagination the way its source material seems to have done for many readers.", "Lawrence is superb in her role.", "What the film offers that the book does not are elements of the outside world that readers were not privy to when confined to Katniss' head.", "The Hunger Games isn't a masterpiece. But it's finally given us a thoughtful action picture for the young and old alike.", "The Hunger Games is impressively cast, beautifully styled, dynamically shot and powerfully edited. However, the standout feature of the film has to be its all encompassing success as an adaptation."], "rating": ["", "6/10", "3.5/4", "7/10", "2/5", "", "", "", "3.5/5", "", "4/5", "", "", "3/4", "", "B+", "", "", "3/4", "4/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Yasser Medina", "PJ Nabarro", "Kathi Maio", "Jim Ross", "Felicia Feaster", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "David Harris", "Brian D.
