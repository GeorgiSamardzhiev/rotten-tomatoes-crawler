Knowing that the country needs her husband to be able to communicate effectively, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter) hires Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush), an Australian actor and speech therapist, to help him overcome his stammer. An extraordinary friendship develops between the two men, as Logue uses unconventional means to teach the monarch how to speak with confidence.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 58m", "director": "Tom Hooper", "studio": "See-SawFilms,BedlamPictures", "theater_date": "Jan 28, 2011", "dvd_date": "Apr 1, 2017", "box_office": "$138.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["While there is mild mounting tension, the crux of the film rests on a mere speech recital which is in itself largely anticlimactic.", "The holiday season's must see film.", "A wonderfully-acted, well-crafted motion picture, but one that is also brutally dull.", "This Oscar-bait tour de force should leave you laughing, and perhaps shedding a tear for a very human monarch.", "Sure, it's predictable. But Hooper is a fine storyteller and this is an undeniably fine work.

Which is why the great pedagogical movies are for all of us, every last one.", "Travel without prejudice and you will enjoy a moving, impeccably acted and surprisingly funny slice of comfort food.

As it turns out, plenty.", "When you're telling a story about people as well-documented as the English royals, it's difficult to achieve a fresh outlook; and unfortunately Mr. Hooper and screenwriter David Seidler don't quite succeed.", "A brilliant Colin Firth leading a sensational cast with Geoffrey Rush and Helena Bonham Carter.

[director Tom Hooper] had the ability to masterfully orchestrate the different elements of the film, especially the multi-star cast... [Full review in Spanish]", "A good, well-made historical biopic that stands out for a luxury cast that does not have a single flaw - notwithstanding the excessive overacting of Timothy Spall in the role of Churchill.
