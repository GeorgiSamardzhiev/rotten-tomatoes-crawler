But when Noah returns to their small town years later, on the cusp of Allie's marriage, it soon becomes clear that their romance is anything but over.", "rating": "53", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 4m", "director": "Nick Cassavetes", "studio": "NewLineCinema,AveryPix", "theater_date": "Jun 25, 2004", "dvd_date": "Mar 18, 2013", "box_office": "$81.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Though torn between two storylines, one of which vastly outshines the other, \"The Notebook\" is still an impressive production.", "Intelligently adapted and written by Jan Sardi, this is the tear-jerker of the summer. A chick flick? Yes. Classic Hollywood romance? Yes. Will it touch your heart? Without a doubt...", "James Garner and Gena Rowlands lend the story a graceful gravity that perhaps the rest of the film's more simplistic romanticism doesn't deserve.", "Never quite escapes the been-there-done-that feeling of Hollywood romantic clich\u00e9 with sunny photography and perfectly tailored costumes to boot.", "Frank Capra would be proud of the way Nick Cassavetes pulls at the heart strings... Have tissues at the ready.", "The Notebook is a ghastly piece of oldie slush which is tediously orchestrated by Nick Cassavetes.", "The Notebook is the kind of syrupy, heightened melodrama more likely to be found in the pages of a Mills & Boon paperback than on the silver screen.", "In a romance where paradise is a duck-filled pond, it helps to be mild-mannered.", "Dentistry in the Renaissance could not have been more painful than watching this.", "The Notebook is premium romantic schlock and confirms director Nick Cassavetes (Rowlands' son) as a specialist in the genre after John Q in 2002.", "Two good, young performers and a couple of not-too-shabby older ones not only make The Notebook worth watching but distinguish the film as one of the year's more pleasant surprises.", "The Notebook is a thoroughly old-fashioned romantic melodrama awash with misty-eyed sentiment as it charts the obstacles placed in the path of two young lovers from opposite sides of the social divide.", "A shameless tear-jerker and as corny as they come, this retro romantic drama skilfully pushes all the right emotional buttons.", "A honey-dipped love story with a surprisingly tart aftertaste, The Notebook is a better-than-you'd-expect adaptation of Nicholas Sparks's bestselling novel of the same name.", "A story about true love that makes you cry, the kind you don't forget. [Full Review in Spanish]", "What saves Notebook, or at least lifts it above itself, are the hints of hard-won grit that both Gosling and Garner inject into their characters.", "Sure, The Notebook's story of first love tends toward the histrionic and self-important. But if that's case, perhaps Cassavetes, like Shakespeare, simply knows how to give the people what they want.", "It's no secret that Mr. Gosling is one of our most gifted young actors. Still, this is his first romantic lead, and he's superb -- interesting in his inwardness, endearing in his demonstrativeness.", "If you ever want to see a flawless example of a movie which is redeemed from mediocrity solely through the cast, there is hardly a better one than this.", "Bland and sentimental, The Notebook is old-fashioned filmmaking aimed at an old-fashioned audience.
