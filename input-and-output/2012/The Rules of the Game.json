[Full Review in Spanish]", "Though pictorially it is very satisfying, M.

It is a film to be savored, like a fine wine whose riches have only grown with age.", "... a story of unsurpassed audacity, which leaves the most refined and ultramodern formalists with their mouths open. [Full review in Spanish]", "The word \"Mozartean\"... gets thrown around a little too eagerly by critics, but one movie, as almost everyone agrees, deserves this supreme benediction -- Jean Renoir's The Rules of the Game.", "On the surface, a lace of flirtations, insinuations and rejections compose the basic plotting. But Renoir uses flashes of accelerating drama to amplify his bigger points.", "This is cinema at its pinnacle: sublime humanism smiling through tears of frustrated sadness.", "The film may not suit all tastes, but its insight and humanity is undeniable.", "Renoir's satire is a sharp dissection of human nature and a glorious piece of art that lives up to its restored reputation.", "...has an attitude of empathetic enlightenment that remains a rarity.", "... at once savage social satire and a compassionate comedy of manners with a sour undercurrent.", "As an experiment it's interesting, but Jean Renoir has made a common error: he attempts to crowd too many ideas into 80 minutes of film fare, resulting in confusion.", "A film that I adore and worship with religious fervor, one of the small handful of movies that I have never been able to exhaust.", "[VIDEO]...a scathing satirical dissection of bourgeois mores and the use of manners to mask its frequently adulterous, and sometime lethal, sins.", "The mobile camera seems to be a member of the party, as it follows the almost balletically choreographed movements of the cast. The effect for the audience is transcendental. We are watching life at its messiest, unfolding at its most beautiful.", "A scathing attack on the show of feeling by a murderously superficial elite . . . the more you watch it, the more Renoir's masterwork reflects the cold, hard truth%u2014The Rules of the Game still apply.", "Welcome to The Rules of the Game, Jean Renoir's delightful, frothy, bittersweet masterpiece about romance, class and manners.", "A great film because of the way it moves beyond social commentary to show how each character, rich and poor, is isolated and at the same time unified by his fears and needs.
