{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Joan Jett (Kristen Stewart) and Cherie Currie (Dakota Fanning), two rebellious teenagers from Southern California, become the frontwomen for the Runaways -- the now-legendary group that paved the way for future generations of female rockers. Under the Svengalilike influence of impresario Kim Fowley, the band becomes a huge success, with Joan as the band's hard-rocking heart, and Cherie as the sex kitten. However, the teens' stormy relationship threatens the band's future.", "rating": "69", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Floria Sigismondi", "studio": "RiverRoad,LinsonEntertainment", "theater_date": "Apr 9, 2010", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$3.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The real star of the film is the music.", "Stunning. Hypnotic. On the money.", "Falls into the usual sorts of narrative traps, including expositional overkill, flimsy character building, and the inexorable rise and subsequent descent into the tedious maelstrom of excess.", "There are some wonderful emotional developments between these young women, forming bonds off stage, before kicking ass on. They are thrust into unknown territory while navigating their own sexuality and identities, and that's the real heart of the film.", "The Runaways is as stylishly honey-toned and authentically grubby as it is kick ass in its portrait of female energy chained to the universally cathartic force of rock 'n' roll.", "While the offstage passion between Jett and Currie gives the film its emotional drive, their in-concert erotic aggression is an occasion for elegantly examining the line between self-expression and self-exploitation.", "It's a too-familiar rags-to-riches-to-rags tale without much substance. But it looks and sounds good, and now and again it rocks.", "The audience is meant to relate to Jett's indignation-the band's success should hinge on their sound, not their looks-but it feels like a bogus position, since we, in watching the scene on the lawn, have been made complicit in Cherie's objectification.", "The acting makes this movie. Too often in a music movie the soundtrack takes first precedence, but here the acting is the center of the movie.", "I find it the worst kind of form over function, in which all involved seem to have forgotten that the aesthetic rebellions of the time stemmed from a deeper defiance of the status quo.", "A full-throttle joyride through fame's treacherous trenches.", "Fanning makes Currie's fame- and pharmaceutical-fueled transformation/liberation at once exhilarating and terrifying.", "", "", "... A typical story of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, but it's told with style and energy that keep it from bogging down amid the clichs.", "[It chooses] to merely nod at the more complicated, strange and exciting aspects of the band's story and spend most of its time touching on the usual stuff", "In age-appropriate casting, Fanning doesn't put a platform boot wrong in her portrayal of a valley girl rock chick (circa. 1975) growing up way too fast, with neither the inclination nor the wherewithal to slow down.", "The film might be intended as a cautionary tale, but that tends to get lost amid the lurid thrills and tacked-on happy ending.", "Aside from Stewart transforming herself into Jett, once the band is formed, there is little about the film that captures the atmosphere of the time period.", "Director Floria Sigismondi brings the tale of this real-life pop-punk band to the screen with the traits of a vapid, glossy promo video. And it works! A shame about the length then."], "rating": ["5/10", "3.0/4", "5.4/10", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "B-", "3/5", "B+", "2.5/5", "3.5/5", "C-", "", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Piers Marchant", "Kristy Strouse", "Felicia Feaster", "Troy Patterson", "Anna Smith", "Jennie Yabroff", "Sarah Marrs", "Lisa Rosman", "Emily Rems", "Michael Dequina", "Nell Minow", "Joshua Rothkopf", "Greg Maki", "Dave White", "Fiona Williams", "Mark Pfeiffer", "Matt Kelemen", "Simon Miraudo"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">In Their Own League", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Charleston City Paper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinesnark", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IFC.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bust Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieReport.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Mom", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Star-Democrat (Easton, MD)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">sbs.com.au", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Times: Reflections on Cinema", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Las Vegas CityLife", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Quickflix"], "date": ["November 30, 2020", "September 21, 2020", "August 11, 2020", "April 8, 2020", "January 23, 2020", "September 5, 2018", "August 23, 2018", "February 8, 2018", "October 24, 2017", "July 18, 2017", "October 7, 2016", "April 8, 2012", "February 18, 2012", "November 17, 2011", "November 5, 2011", "April 4, 2011", "March 30, 2011", "March 9, 2011", "January 31, 2011", "October 21, 2010"]}}
