{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Denounced by his wife as a possible spy in 1939, Janusz (Jim Sturgess) finds himself in a remote Siberian labor camp. Faced with brutal conditions inside and out, Janusz is determined to escape. A blizzard provides him with the perfect opportunity, and he and a small group of fellow prisoners make a break for it. Escape, however, is the easy part, for Janusz and his companions face a 4,000 mile trek on foot through the frozen Himalayas before they can truly be free.", "rating": "74", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 13m", "director": "Peter Weir", "studio": "ExclusiveFilms", "theater_date": "Jan 21, 2011", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$2.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["For the sheer art of true moviemaking at its old school finest, it's impossible to not recommend viewing The Way Back.", "An endurance test for both the characters and the audience, and I mean that as a compliment.", "A majestic and powerful film. A triumph of the human spirit.", "The Way Back is a hefty cinematic experience set against the vast vistas of history that may not have you cheering on its heroes at every turn, but that will enthrall you in their epic journey nonetheless.", "It's about the landscapes and backdrops. They provide a great diversion away from the poor dialogue and the bluntly heroic characters.", "I had no reason to care. And their spiritual journeys are as predictable as they are pat... It's all voyage at the expense of the voyagers, so lacks any moral power.", "... a placid, almost pleasant film, so reluctant to offend that it fails to engage.", "[Peter] Weir is marvelously attuned to the natural world but keeps the focus on the human story while acknowledging the power of the natural world, not hostile so much as inhospitable...", "The man-versus-the-natural world story is in Weir's wheelhouse, and Harris and Farrell get into a scene-stealing duel. Worth the trek.", "A gorgeously mounted epic that for all its virtues feels maddeningly remote.", "The Way Back is an inspiring story that is beautifully photographed and full of interesting and well acted characters.", "Like its characters, this drama plods along but its compelling plot makes it worth seeing.", "\"The Way Back\" is a boring movie. Repetitive, protracted and wearisome. Mostly, though: It's just long.", "a solid, resonant meditation on survival, on hope, on the value of life in the face of implacable hostility, portrayed memorably by an excellent cast and [Director] Weir's vast, brutal, awe-inspiring landscapes", "An old fashioned survival yarn, beautifully shot and well-told.", "Script-wise, there is nothing truly revelatory here, but the patient viewer will be rewarded by a film of unique awe and heart wrenching wonder.", "However, among solid performances, beautiful locations, and a truly harrowing journey, this film left me feeling empty.", "It's unfortunate that Peter Weir's first film in seven years, although a remarkable story, by its very nature risks tediousness.", "This is a perfect example of the well-made (from acclaimed director Peter Weir), well-acted and well-everything-elsed film that you watch, admire and then hope to never lay eyes on again.", "Screen-saver metaphysics"], "rating": ["3.5/4", "B", "", "3/5", "3/5", "", "", "", "4/4", "", "8/10", "3.5/5", "C", "3.5/4", "3/4", "B", "2/5", "", "3/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Matthew Migliorini", "Kaleem Aftab", "Deborah Ross", "Jennie Yabroff", "Sean Axmaker", "Joe Neumaier", "Sean Burns", "Amy Curtis", "John Hanlon", "Will Leitch", "Jay Antani", "Roger Moore", "Bruce Bennett", "Grae Drake", "Annlee Ellingson", "Dave White", "Fernando F.
