Even worse, a number of rivals aim to beat Yellowbeard to his fortune, including an old shipmate (Peter Boyle), a secret agent (Eric Idle) and a pair of conquistadors (Cheech Marin, Tommy Chong).", "rating": "22", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Mel Damski", "studio": "HemdaleFilmCorporation[us]", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 3, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["no laugh track to save us from dud after dud.", "More good than bad, worth owning.", "", "The humor is as spotty as the pirates are ratty.", "Yellowbeard seems almost to have exhausted itself with its casting.
