{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Struggling boutique bookseller Kathleen Kelly (Meg Ryan) hates Joe Fox (Tom Hanks), the owner of a corporate Foxbooks chain store that just moved in across the street. When they meet online, however, they begin an intense and anonymous Internet romance, oblivious of each other's true identity. Eventually Joe learns that the enchanting woman he's involved with is actually his business rival. He must now struggle to reconcile his real-life dislike for her with the cyber love he's come to feel.", "rating": "70", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "Nora Ephron", "studio": "WarnerBrothers", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 24, 2014", "box_office": "$115.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The most worthwhile tension in You've Got Mail lies in the simple but pure ecstasy of receiving an email from a person you are excited about. Long live the parts of the film that refurbish the excitement of our sometimes-misguided yearnings.", "What Nora and Delia Ephron do is update The Shop Around the Corner for the digital era. Or at least how the era looked in the mid-1990s.", "It's the emotional complexity of Kathleen's interior journey that still resonates.", "It's surprising how relevant this movie feels, even 20 years later. But it's not just nostalgia or deep themes that keep bringing us back, it's everything!", "It is chock full of Nora Ephron's perfect writing.", "\"You've Got Mail\" is a messed up story of early 90s catfishing. Watch it for the city/apartment/style porn, but don't let the Ephrons (or Tom Hanks) fool you: Joe is scum.", "A great big hug of a film.", "The coincidences that make the destined lovers' paths cross aren't contrived with much finesse, but the characters get in some decidedly clever lines.", "The well-honed dramedic performances by endearingly mock-cranky Hanks and quirky, cryin' Ryan add just enough weight to what might otherwise float away...[Blu-ray]", "Predictable-but-sweet romantic comedy.", "Tom Hanks, Meg Ryan and America Online. Could you be anymore 1990s?", "...you've got a lot of saccharine sweetness in the film, but it's a good kind of sweetness, a gentle, loveable, delightful sweetness.", "The clumsily loaded characterisation not only treats almost every other figure as dispensable, but doesn't even bother to make Meg and Tom properly sympathetic.", "Mail may not be as romantic as Sleepless, but it's wittier.", "You've Got Mail is not as saccharine as I expected, but the sugar-coated love story offers us nothing new or original.", "There's no denying the on-screen chemistry between Hanks and Ryan, but still it never really seems to spark as much as it did in Sleepless in Seattle.", "", "There is something marvelously contrived about this classic situation: two attractive and incongruous characters who don't know what we know:They belong with each, and when the heck will they get together?", "You've Got Mail is probably not as engaging as Sleepless, with which it will inevitably be compared, but it has its moments.", "It's a good date movie, and I recommend it.
