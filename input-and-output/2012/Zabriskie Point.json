Beside it, Easy Rider and Medium Cool seem merely the rude posturings of thumb-sucking infants.", "Antonioni wrongly surmises that you can probe a nation's soul by glossily probing its billboards.", "You can take the position that the idea was preposterous to start with, or terrific and muddied up horrendously -- but the picture is a knockout, filled with passages that leave you open-mouthed with delight.", "Everything that in American cinema is rage and truth, and violent and dissatisfied indictment, becomes stale and dead in Zabriskie Point. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Zabriskie Point is a both a thriller and a doped-out dream-capsule of the revolutionary hippy movement in California.", "A maligned masterpiece.", "Antonioni's head trip of a film is very pleasurable.", "A visually sumptuous experience, it also typifies the very worst excesses of hippie-era filmmaking.", "As a fan of Antonioni's other works, I'd have to say that, of the ones I've seen, Zabriskie Point ranks near the bottom.", "Antonioni's first U.S. film is flawed, but it's worth watching.", "...can't be regarded as any sort of success. It's a self-indulgent movie, filled with half-baked ideas and radical sloganeering.", "You will not see a better distillation of the entire 1960s and everything it stood for - good, bad, indifferent, insightful - than this uncompromising artistic overview.", "Almost 40 years later, Zabriskie Point exists to teach us more exact and sensitive perceptions about a cultural moment that its original audience was too close to appropriately observe.", "If you just sit back and let the film ride out as an experience, you're bound to enjoy the journey", "If the film is a failure, then at least it is a striking and provocative failure that attempted to challenge audiences.", "[Features] a handsome lyrical view of America right through the fantastically photographed shots of 1970 culture floating and shooting into the air.", "Antonioni has sought to bring into the focus of his own insights, the student vs establishment conflict. He is on foreign terrain.", "With this picture the director falls into two traps: employing endless 'anti-Establishment' cliches and saddling himself with the underwhelming talents of Mark Frechette.", "Having seen this and Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (the latter repeatedly) in the same week, it's hard not to see them as two sides of the same horny, hazy, and hirsute coin.", "Antonioni's sorrowing, stranger's-eye view of modern America is sadly flawed by the way his 'story' s bogged down in the mood of student revolt dogging the nation in the late '60s."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "4/5", "5/5", "5/5", "3/5", "2.5/4", "B-", "7", "5/5", "", "3.5/5", "3/5", "", "", "2/4", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Larry Zolf", "Michael Ross", "Jacob Brackman", "Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos", "Kate Muir", "David Jenkins", "Peter Bradshaw", "Tom Huddleston", "Jeffrey M.
