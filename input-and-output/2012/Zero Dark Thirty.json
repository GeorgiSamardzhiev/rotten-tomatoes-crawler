{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Following the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, Osama bin Laden becomes one of the most-wanted men on the planet. The worldwide manhunt for the terrorist leader occupies the resources and attention of two U.S. presidential administrations. Ultimately, it is the work of a dedicated female operative (Jessica Chastain) that proves instrumental in finally locating bin Laden. In May 2011, Navy SEALs launch a nighttime strike, killing bin Laden in his compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 37m", "director": "Kathryn Bigelow", "studio": "MarkBoal,AnnapurnaPictures,FirstLightProduction", "theater_date": "Jan 11, 2013", "dvd_date": "Sep 7, 2014", "box_office": "$95.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["As was the case with The Hurt Locker (2008), where the central figures were US soldiers in Iraq, Bigelow concentrates in her latest work on how exhausting and difficult it is to be a victimizer.", "A superbly edge-of-your-seat experience, perfectly riddled with unshielded and realistic violence and an enthralling hunt for evidence.", "Kathryn Bigelow's expansive drama follows the decade-long international manhunt for Osama bin Laden, from the events of 9/11 to his eventual death at the hands of US Marines.", "It very likely says quite a bit about Kathryn Bigelow's Zero Dark Thirty that the CIA has felt compelled to publicly disparage the film's accuracy.", "[T]he mix of technical mastery and conscious hollowness that left such a deep impression on me.", "Is a very intense dramatic thriller that can be classified as one of the best of its genre. [Full review in Spanish]", "[Zero Dark Thirty] is one of the great cinematic procedurals ever made.", "Jessica Chastain acts the hell out of an epic role based on the real woman who tracked down Osama bin Laden ...", "[Kathryn] Bigelow and [Mark] Boal have done it again. A film destined to become as much a part of the fabric of America as the hunt for Osama bin Laden itself...", "[Bigelow's] direction... delivers an intensity rarely seen in today's cinema and as the dramatisation plays out to its emotional and thrilling climax, you cannot help but feel a sense of true accomplishment in front and behind the camera.", "Both fascinating and maddeningly frustrating.", "When it comes to establishing and maintaining tension, there wasn't a better American genre picture released this year. Refrain from viewing it as historical record and you won't leave disappointed.", "They do not excuse or glorify torture; they do something worse: they draw the audience into accommodating it.", "[Jason Clarke] carries a sweetness and retained humanity that strikes the viewer, and breaks our hearts even as we flinch.", "This is crackerjack filmmaking, at once thrilling and deeply felt, a gripping CIA procedural that shows us what great movies are all about.", "A superb political thriller, anchored by outstanding work from Jessica Chastain. In a year that featured some outstanding films with political themes, such as \"Argo\" and \"Lincoln,\" this is the best of the bunch.", "The story [Kathryn] Bigelow and [Mark] Boal tell is an ugly one, brutal, disconnected, horribly human, but what makes the film such an exceptional piece of work is the way they center it in the quietest moments:", "What it does succeed in doing, however, is capturing the melancholy, tension and uncertainty of one of America's most difficult decades.", "There's no show-boating or wasted time here -- this is a case where well-researched art makes us believe we're watching something that is true.", "A restrained, world-weary impression of the various American attempts (from torture, interrogation, surveillance, and the final hi-tech marine raid) to track down bin Laden."], "rating": ["", "9/10", "", "3.5/4", "", "8/10", "4/4", "8/10", "", "5/5", "3.8/5", "3/5", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "4/5", "A-", "4/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Mike Massie", "Film Companion Staff", "Richard Propes", "CJ Sheu", "Yasser Medina", "Sara Michelle Fetters", "Sarah Boslaugh", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Katie Smith-Wong", "David Harris", "Scott Marks", "JoAnn Wypijewski", "Leslie Combemale", "Matthew Lucas", "Micheal Compton", "Molly Templeton", "Daniel Green", "Abbie Bernstein", "PJ Nabarro"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Companion", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Review Film Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MovieFreak.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheArtsStl", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Musings of Guitargalchina", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Diego Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Nation", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Eugene Weekly (OR)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Assignment X", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro"], "date": ["February 12, 2021", "December 2, 2020", "October 27, 2020", "September 27, 2020", "July 1, 2020", "June 25, 2020", "April 26, 2020", "December 30, 2019", "November 27, 2019", "November 26, 2019", "November 19, 2019", "October 28, 2019", "October 28, 2019", "July 30, 2019", "June 8, 2019", "April 11, 2019", "February 26, 2019", "February 8, 2019", "January 30, 2019", "January 27, 2019"]}}
