{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Traveling back in time isn't simple, as James Cole (Bruce Willis) learns the hard way. Imprisoned in the 2030s, James is recruited for a mission that will send him back to the 1990s. Once there, he's supposed to gather information about a nascent plague that's about to exterminate the vast majority of the world's population. But, aside from the manic Jeffrey (Brad Pitt), he gets little in the way of cooperation, not least from medical gatekeepers like Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe).", "rating": "89", "genre": "Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 11m", "director": "Terry Gilliam", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "Jan 26, 1995", "dvd_date": "May 8, 2015", "box_office": "$57.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["I didn't care largely because of the lack of authenticity that Willis brings to the character of James Cole.", "A fascinating journey, topped off with an unforgettable conclusion, made even more compelling with repeated viewings.", "Prevention, not time travel, is the key to halting a viral contagion.", "Gilliam seems to stick pretty intently to the script, but his visual genius comes through repeatedly. He is also perhaps one of the best filmmakers at creating dreamscapes which threaten to crack apart, become sentient, and then turn murderous.", "if there is something that stands out above everything else is the hypnotic production design that Gilliam and his team creates for the future in which the action starts.

It gives fans of the sci-fi genre something to love: An intelligent film on time travel that begs a second viewing.", "This dystopian time-travelling sci-fi is a reminder that the director can make films that are visually inventive, intellectually engaging and downright exciting.", "Terry Gilliam always had a unique spin on dystopian fantasy", "Constantly surprising and consistently unsettling.", "One of the best-looking and smartest sci-fi films of the modern era.", "Terry Gilliam has seldom been more inventive or more compelling.", "Gilliam goes on to deliver a movie that is not only rich in visual detail but offers an involving, occasionally baffling storyline and builds the tension to positively unbearable levels during the final reel.", "While all of Gilliam's movies are worth seeing, there's a fair amount of his designer grimness here mixed in with the cabaret comedy.", "Gilliam's greatest all around film.", "speculative fiction at its best in that it doesn't just trifle with science fiction concepts, but rather tells a grander story with characters and world disasters", "Terry Gilliam's violent dystopian masterpiece.", "A dark and gritty sci-fi thriller, 12 Monkeys stands apart from other sci-fi films, due to its unique and twisted concept on the future of mankind.", "Gilliam's polarizing style is at its near-best...a dazzling feat of storytelling that bristles with provocative ideas.
