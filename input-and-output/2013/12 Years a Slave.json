{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the years before the Civil War, Solomon Northup (Chiwetel Ejiofor), a free black man from upstate New York, is kidnapped and sold into slavery in the South. Subjected to the cruelty of one malevolent owner (Michael Fassbender), he also finds unexpected kindness from another, as he struggles continually to survive and maintain some of his dignity. Then in the 12th year of the disheartening ordeal, a chance meeting with an abolitionist from Canada changes Solomon's life forever.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 14m", "director": "Steve McQueen", "studio": "RiverRoad,NewRegencyPictures,PlanBEntertainment", "theater_date": "Oct 18, 2013", "dvd_date": "Aug 31, 2015", "box_office": "$56.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A harrowing, stark movie that is equal parts educational and devastating.", "Director McQueen, drawing on the visual aesthetic of his previous works Shame and Hunger, never shies away from frames that capture the ways that beauty exists in the most painful situations.", "The subject matter lends itself to compelling stories, but the characters that suffer the worst injustices aren't the primary focus and receive no closure.", "It seems impossible to think of anyone turning in as fine a performance as Ejiofor does here.", "It may have taken its time to daunder down under, garnering plenty of awards buzz behind it, but late January finally saw Steve McQueen's impeccably crafted slavery epic hit our shores, and boy was the eventual Best Picture Oscar-winner worth the wait.", "An incredible story of a man who clung to the hope of returning to his family, and used it to push away the horrible world he was forced into.", "I only have one word to describe 12 Years a Slave - masterpiece.", "The dramatic power of this film is an explicitly graphic and emotional material, in addition to working as an allegory towards racism and slavery, a cinema that is not afraid to express the shameful past of a nation. [Full review in Spanish]", "As McQueen's observant camera reminds us, we are all, in some insidious way, kin under the skin.", "Overall, 12 Years a Slave is a brave piece of filmmaking and one to last through the ages in terms of acting and storytelling.", "12 Years a Slave occupies that sparsely inhabited place beyond Oscar statues and Tomatometer scores, in the upper stratosphere of movies that act as time machine and history professor. It is, for want of a better word, important.", "The film itself is beautiful. Each shot is pure artwork. Each note of music is pure emotion. Every cut is perfectly pieced together. Steve McQueen has assembled something that is great.", "Exquisitely built, so expertly acted and so fearlessly directed.", "It's an exhausting journey through one man's experiences being denied his humanity, a decade living as property. There's no lesson to be learned. If you need a movie to tell you that slavery is wrong, well, this movie isn't for you. No movie is.", "Too often have [slavery's] horrors been whitewashed in popular culture, but here at last McQueen lays them bare through the eyes and words of a man who experienced the unthinkable.", "12 Years A Slave is such a powerful film that it leaves you overwhelmed by the horror of its truth. It's a faithful adaptation of the real-life memoir of Solomon Northup.", "The definitive film on its subject matter.", "It is a brave piece that takes the uneasy subject and creates a superb piece of cinema. It is among the very best films of 2013.", "The performances are truly harrowing.", "There's a tyranny in McQueen's vision as he compels hero Solomon Northup on a vile trajectory of kidnap, brutality and dehumanisation."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "", "6/10", "4.0/4", "5/5", "A", "5/5", "8/10", "", "3.5/5", "A+", "", "", "8/10", "4/4", "5/5", "5/5", "", "3.5/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Nijla Mu&#39;min", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Stephen A.
