Touching human story. [Full review in Spanish]", "Bring the tissues - you're gonna need 'em. Cooper may need them to polish his awards after proving this story is evergreen.", "The trajectory of a doubting girl made famous by the love of a damaged man is beginning to feel a bit hoary in 2018", "Cooper extends his career into a new field with his dramatic work and Gaga, who rivals him in both presence and raw talent, is a joy to watch.", "The story may appear a bit thin in places but it's an epic love story of award-winning proportions that will have you in awe from the raw talent and ugly crying at its heartbreaking conclusion", "My favorite film of 2018.", "An endearing film with two impeccable performances from Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper. [Full review in Spanish]", "It's not the notes themselves, it's how you play them that make a song great.\"", "Cooper proves to be just as talented behind the camera as he is in front ... He also brings out a performance from Lady Gaga that you might not think was possible if you simply judged her from her music and/or public persona", "This new remake of A Star Is Born is somewhat predictable, because, in effect, the back story is the same, but the plot moves with the great chemistry exhibited by Lady Gaga and Cooper himself. [Full review in Spanish]", "Star is Born is a tour de force directorial debut that channels Cooper's off-screen struggles with addiction and sobriety that vibes deeply personal and painfully honest.", "It's a really good movie. I was impressed.", "It's a solid movie. It's really good. I thought Lady Gaga is fantastic.", "Pop singer Lady Gaga is quite good as the wife... she subtly and convincingly manages the character's transformation from vulnerable ingenue to self-confident celebrity."], "rating": ["B-", "7/10", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "9/10", "4/4", "3.5/5", "3.5/5", "5/5", "", "", "B", "", "7/10", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jesse Hassenger", "Mike Massie", "Charlotte Harrison", "Paul McGuire Grimes", "Matthew St. Clair", "Richard Propes", "Victor Pineyro", "Jason Fraley", "Stephen A.
