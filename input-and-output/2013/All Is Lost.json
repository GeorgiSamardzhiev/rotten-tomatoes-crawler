{"metadata": {"synopsis": "During a solo voyage in the Indian Ocean, a veteran mariner (Robert Redford) awakes to find his vessel taking on water after a collision with a stray shipping container. With his radio and navigation equipment disabled, he sails unknowingly into a violent storm and barely escapes with his life. With any luck, the ocean currents may carry him into a shipping lane -- but, with supplies dwindling and the sharks circling, the sailor is forced to face his own mortality.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "J.C.

Every line in Redford's weather-beaten face seems invested in the struggle.", "Hollywood legend Redford holds our attention singlehandedly and though it is only him and the sea, the suspense never flags.", "Redford delivers a tour de force performance to ensure this beautifully simple idea enthralls throughout.", "This is a glorious piece of cinema that revels in the core values of silent film, a tale of man versus nature that speaks to the heart rather than the mind.", "This is a brilliant film with an intense and engrossing plot and an actor who does justice to his extraordinarily demanding role.", "All Is Lost's grandiose portrait of honour in struggle is a lucid and indomitable celebration of the endurance of the human spirit that makes for one hell of a ride.", "Unlike similar films, Zemeckis' Cast Away and Cuar\u00f3n's Gravity, which wrapped up in their contingencies familiarly sentimental undertones, Chandor keeps it pared down and real", "All Is Lost can be tedious to watch at times but its metaphoric overtones about crisis-driven alienation and determination will certainly float one's boat.", "In any event, the film is a subtle acting exercise and a triumph of cinematography; it is also a tad ho-hum.", "It is a bold and masterful film, and Redford is great.", "Its lack of detail and substance might be aggravating to some viewers, but the blank palette puts you in a position to run free with your own interpretation, and I have a tough time believing that wasn't director J.C. Chandor's intention all along.", "There's almost no dialogue and yet it grips from damp beginning to seriously watery end.", "Powerful.", "Even with the boring bits, it's a solid A of a movie, a top-tenner for sure.", "All Is Lost is a testament to the possibilities of digital cinema: a film like this, shot in such close confines, simply couldn't be made with anything other than lightweight, handheld cameras.", "As grim and hopeless as things could possibly get in a movie called All Is Lost, the movie is essentially about perseverance: playing it smart, staying safe and not giving up until -- well, see the title."], "rating": ["4/5", "8/10", "3.5/4", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "9/10", "", "4/5", "4/5", "2.5/4", "6/10", "5/5", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Pamela Hutchinson", "Brian D.
