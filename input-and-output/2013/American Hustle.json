{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Irving Rosenfeld (Christian Bale) dabbles in forgery and loan-sharking, but when he falls for fellow grifter Sydney Prosser (Amy Adams), things change in a big way. Caught red-handed by FBI agent Richie DiMaso (Bradley Cooper), Irv and Sydney are forced to work under cover as part of DiMaso's sting operation to nail a New Jersey mayor (Jeremy Renner). Meanwhile, Irv's jealous wife (Jennifer Lawrence) may be the one to bring everyone's world crashing down.

Who's right and who's wrong in a situation like this?", "With American Hustle, O. Russell proves once again that he is one of the best American directors of recent times. [Full review in Spanish]", "AMERICAN HUSTLE is light, but succeeds in entertaining with its plotting back-and-forths and slightly ridiculous characters.", "The story stumbles ever so slight but it is ultimately fun, brilliantly acted and incredibly stylish.", "It feels like an interesting exercise, a chance for Russell and his cast to dress up and have fun now that none of them really have nothing left to prove.", "A slickly paced con game that's so frenetically enjoyable, it'll fool you into believing it's even more substantial than it really is.", "A movie that leaves you agog with the acting prowess displayed therein.", "It does sometimes feel as if you are handling counterfeit Scorsese goods but when American Hustle is great, it's really great.", "American Hustle is the kind of film that just sizzles on the screen. With a first-rate cast, crisp dialogue and another solid directing effort by David O. Russell, this is a film that enters the fray as an Oscar contender.", "Both a beautifully orchestrated con artist thriller and a pulsating homage to seventies Hollywood, O. Russell plays fast and loose with a vaguely believable 'true story' narrative...", "I'd love to recommend it for everything it is, but I find myself arguing against it for many of those same reasons.", "The con is on. Enjoy the game!", "There's never a dull moment in American Hustle and the pieces all fit together.
