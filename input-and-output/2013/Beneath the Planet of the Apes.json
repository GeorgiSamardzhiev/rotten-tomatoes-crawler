Less subtle and profound than its predecessor, it's still an exciting and colourful action adventure.", "The zoom-frenzy direction of Ted Post, and a vague satire of Vietnam featuring some hysterical protesting peacenik chimps, does little to cover-up the film's difficulties. But it does have its moments.", "The whole movie is often frightening in the wrong way -- not by force of satire but by weight of attitudinizing.", "There are a lot of good ideas peppered throughout the screenplay by Paul Dehn...The problem is that none of these ideas are properly nurtured.", "Suffers from Jaws 2 syndrome, attempting to replicate the beats of the first film too closely with much of the same cast reprising their roles and character ticks and because of that, it simply doesn't have its own fingerprint.", "The best parts of the film are also the places where it's most ineffective as a sequel.", "Social commentary was not one of this glum film's strong points.", "annoying sequel", "[A] quickie follow-up that vainly tries to imitate the look of the original on an obviously limited budget, and for the most part, eschews the philosophical, social, and racial subtext of the first film in favor of straightforward shoot-em-up.", "Hokey and slapdash.", "A lot less poky than the original, and generally more entertaining.", "This first sequel to Planet of the Apes isn't bad, but already shows the way the original conception was to degenerate into routine comic strip adventure.", "", "One of the best sequels ever, building on the story while re-delivering what fans liked about the first", "", ""], "rating": ["", "C-", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "3/10", "C", "2/4", "2.5/5", "", "4/5", "", "2/5", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Don Kaye", "Matt Goldberg", "Ian Nathan", "Sky Staff", "Alan Jones", "Film4 Staff", "Penelope Gilliatt", "Zaki Hasan", "Chris Alexander", "Tim Brayton", "Dennis Schwartz", "Stefan Birgir Stefansson", "Michael Scheinfeld", "Variety Staff", "Rob Gonsalves", "Tom Milne", "Emanuel Levy", "Luke Y.
