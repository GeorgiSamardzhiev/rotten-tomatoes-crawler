{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After her marriage to a wealthy businessman (Alec Baldwin) collapses, New York socialite Jasmine (Cate Blanchett) flees to San Francisco and the modest apartment of her sister, Ginger (Sally Hawkins). Although she's in a fragile emotional state and lacks job skills, Jasmine still manages to voice her disapproval of Ginger's boyfriend, Chili (Bobby Cannavale). Jasmine begrudgingly takes a job in a dentist's office, while Ginger begins dating a man (Louis C.K.) who's a step up from Chili.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Woody Allen", "studio": "PerdidoProductions", "theater_date": "Jul 26, 2013", "dvd_date": "Jun 6, 2015", "box_office": "$33.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Darker than most of Allen's recent output, Blue Jasmine doesn't go for laughs - very often anyway - but is an astutely crafted psychological character study.", "Purposefully structuring a film to deprive viewers of a precise beginning, middle, and end is a risky game that doesn't always pay off.", "Blanchett is the true author of Blue Jasmine. It's a towering performance that remains fixed on your brain.", "The film ultimately depends upon and is rewarded by Cate Blanchett's insightful and emotionally resonant performance as Jasmine.", "Jasmine could have been the same neurotic type we've seen in previous Woody Allen films, but Blanchett makes the character just as much her own creation as it is his.", "With Blue Jasmine, Allen reaches another new mark in his legendary directorial career, delivering one of his best dramas in recent years. [Full review in Spanish]", "Cate Blanchett is over the moon in the best Woody Allen drama since Match Point.", "Blanchett, channeling Lauren Bacall, is so genuinely affecting that she may as well have been some tragically elegant Tennessee Williams' victim transported into the midst of Allen.", "It's the kind of performance Oscars are made of, but beyond any thought of awards or accolades, Blanchett delivers a once-in-a-lifetime kind of achievement.", "An efficacious character study of somebody truly fallen.", "Though Allen opted to not endow Blue Jasmine with his travelogue visual flare that I've grown fond of, Blanchett provides so much to chew on and gawk at that she single-handedly makes the film a certifiably significant work.", "This may be Blanchett's best performance of her career in a film that is one of Allen's better works in recent memory.", "The fact that a film with this depth of tragedy works, despite being billed as a comedy, is a tribute to the brilliant performances of the cast and one of the most polished pieces of direction by Allen in recent times.", "Blanchett is a true force of nature; sozzled, depressed and on the verge of madness, it's the best work of her career.", "There are the raw materials for a piercing American tragedy, detailing the corrosive hubris of a certain type of moneyed class, but a far more studied and icier eye is needed.", "Blue Jasmine is Woody Allen at the top of his game.", "It's been said Allen casts people who share traits with the personalities he'd like them to play. If that is the secret to a great film, then this movie is a sample of that genius.", "It's brilliantly watchable, if not mesmerising; and brilliantly performed, particularly by Cate Blanchett, who will knock your socks off, and may knock them off so explosively there is every chance you will never retrieve them again.", "A self-aggrandizing look at how the mighty (Allen) have fallen.", "Blue Jasmine weaponises Blanchett's elegant image against us, showing a character who is trying with all her might to maintain this glamour that is falling down around her. Seriously, she's amazing in this one."], "rating": ["4/5", "7/10", "A", "3.5/4", "A-", "7/10", "", "", "3/4", "5/5", "8.4/10", "B+", "", "5/5", "2/5", "8/10", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "Murtada Elfadl", "Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "Yasser Medina", "David Lamble", "Nicholas Bell", "Matthew Lucas", "Cameron Ward", "Bernard Boo", "Micheal Compton", "Rachael Mead", "Craig Williams", "PJ Nabarro", "Debbie Baldwin", "Sarah Gopaul", "Deborah Ross", "Pat Padua", "Kambole Campbell"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sundays with Cate", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bay Area Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Way Too Indie", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Square Eyes", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Ladue News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Digital Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">DCist", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View"], "date": ["January 31, 2021", "December 3, 2020", "September 4, 2020", "September 3, 2020", "July 24, 2020", "June 25, 2020", "June 19, 2020", "August 22, 2019", "June 8, 2019", "June 4, 2019", "April 12, 2019", "April 9, 2019", "March 20, 2019", "March 5, 2019", "February 3, 2019", "November 1, 2018", "October 26, 2018", "September 5, 2018", "August 30, 2018", "August 25, 2018"]}}
