But what he chums out is vastly unappetizing.", "The vampire story turned into a gory and romantic epic fairy tale. This is a powerful entry into the universe of adaptations of the count that simply fell in love. [Full review in Spanish].", "A phantasmagoric work of gothic horror that is no less terrifying to me today than the other-worldly fantasies of biblical devils and demons that I experienced in my nightmares when I was a child.", "Dracula's deepest problem is that for all its playing with the history of the genre, it stirs little sense of dread, barely even a tingle of uncanniness.", "Beware, Francis Ford Coppola, degenerate, American; beware how you meddle with Count de Ville. Faugh!", "Coppola's remake throws so much fancy technique at its story that the usually foolproof drama at its core gets drowned in a tide of images. It's not scary, it's not suspenseful and its eroticism is largely theoretical.", "James Hart's screenplay may put Bram Stoker's name up there in the title, but there's no certainty that the author would recognise the result.", "What we're left with is a gorgeous, but tedious adaptation of the classic tale that feels confused about its own identity, leaping this way and that, while at other times just meandering about.", "Coppola's stunning adaptation of the classic vampire novel is a movie lover's dream, as the director elected to rely on old-school cinematic techniques (albeit executed with modern-day aplomb) to punch across his bold and bloody interpretation.", "It's shame to see such a mess made of a project with such a capable cast.", "A feast for the senses that fails to satisfy the heart, libido or mind.", "Bloody, sexy, scary Dracula for mature teens only!", "This luscious film restores the creature's nobility and gives him peace.", "Salom\u00e9 goes to Transylvania", "Fighting against pop culture expectations and a century of vampire clich\u00e9, Coppola's approach is unique. Like it or not, no one had ever seen a \"Dracula\" quite like this.", "misguided and ludicrous", "Unashamedly epic, but it's the details which make the film, particularly vampire-killing Anthony Hopkins and Tom Waits as insect-gobbling Renfield.", "Has a film ever promised so much yet delivered so little?"], "rating": ["8/10", "", "", "4/4", "", "", "", "", "", "2.5/5", "3.5/4", "2/5", "C+", "3/5", "", "3.5/5", "5/5", "2/5", "", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Emma Wolfe", "Emily Heller", "Dolores Barclay", "Federico Furzan", "Dom Nero", "Geoffrey O&#39;Brien", "Vanessa Letts", "David Ansen", "Adam Mars-Jones", "Jeff Beck", "Matt Brunson", "Jennie Kermode", "Nick Schager", "Kelly Kessler", "Richard Corliss", "James Wegg", "Brian Holcomb", "Jay Antani", "Film4 Staff", "Tom Hibbert"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">SpookyAstronauts", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Polygon", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinelipsis", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Esquire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New York Review of Books", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Blu Spot", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Eye for Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lessons of Darkness", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">JWR", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CinemaBlend", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmcritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine"], "date": ["October 26, 2020", "October 8, 2020", "February 20, 2020", "June 12, 2019", "October 16, 2018", "August 14, 2018", "July 24, 2018", "February 8, 2018", "November 15, 2017", "July 16, 2016", "October 10, 2015", "November 7, 2013", "June 1, 2011", "January 2, 2011", "October 20, 2009", "July 22, 2009", "May 2, 2008", "October 14, 2007", "September 26, 2007", "September 26, 2007"]}}
