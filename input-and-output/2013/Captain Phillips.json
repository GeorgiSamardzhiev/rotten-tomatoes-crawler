{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In April 2009, the U.S. containership Maersk Alabama sails toward its destination on a day that seems like any other. Suddenly, Somali pirates race toward the vessel, climb aboard and take everyone hostage. The captain of the ship, Richard Phillips (Tom Hanks), looks to protect his crew from the hostile invaders, and their leader, Muse (Barkhad Abdi). The pirates are after millions of dollars, and Phillips must use his wits to make sure everyone survives and returns home safely.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 13m", "director": "Paul Greengrass", "studio": "ScottRudinProductions,TriggerStreetProductions,MichaelDeLuca", "theater_date": "Oct 11, 2013", "dvd_date": "Nov 13, 2015", "box_office": "$107.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A terrifically tense thriller that is worth the price of a full seat, even though you'll only use the edge.", "Features exceptional performances, led by veteran actor Tom Hanks.", "Newcomer Barkhad Abdi, a Somali with no previous acting experience who beautifully captures both the desperate menace and the thoughtful humanity.", "Even though the ending is well known, the suspense is tangible, made through expert craftsmanship and authentic acting.", "Tom Hanks puts on one of the best performances of his career in Captain Phillips...", "Paul Greengrass assimilates the dramatic events of Captain Phillips, teaching us how modern pirates operate in these times with outstanding cinematic execution. [Full review in Spanish]", "There's too much waiting and overly dramatic reflection. But the film does finish with a thrilling flourish, and the details of the cat and mouse games at sea are quite riveting.", "Nothing feels false and in its final 30 minutes Captain Phillips is damned near perfect.", "Sadly, thanks to the Dutch film A Hijacking, which \"coincidentally\" hit DVD this week, Captain Phillips isn't even the best \"hijacked by Somali pirates\" movie in the last 6 months.", "Mainstream films this good deserve to be celebrated, because they don't come along nearly as often as they should.", "It's a compelling, ripped-from-the-headlines drama that offers plenty of tension -- even if you are familiar with the story.", "The Navy SEALS procedural is a bit of a jumble even as it comfortingly demonstrates American competence in the face of a standoff. Still, it's the captain's passion that gives the movie its emotional intensity.", "Hanks excels as Phillips with his everyman persona.", "What makes Captain Phillips so gripping, apart from its visceral sense of danger, is that it daringly gives us both points of view.", "Works as a reasonably effective thriller, although, in retrospect, that seems more down to the inherent strengths of the scenario than any brio in the storytelling itself.", "Director Paul Greengrass creates a compelling film that is engaging without being preachy or didactic. Tom Hanks is, as always, stellar; and first-time actor Barkhad Abdi is moving as the villain/victim of the story.", "Captain Phillips is a stupendous thrill ride that should not be missed. Hanks' performance alone makes it worth the price of admission, but Abdi and Greengrass sweeten the deal.", "Captain Phillips is a tense and taut thriller with exceptional acting from its leading men.", "My heart was in my mouth throughout. It is nail-bitingly exciting, even if you know the outcome, and I think I can safely say it's a better film than the one I thought I was going to see.", "It's a breath-taking cat-and-mouse thriller with a superb central performance from Tom Hanks as well as from newcomer Barkhad Abdi."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "8/10", "3.5/4", "A", "4/5", "8/10", "2.5/4", "4.2/5", "C", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "A-", "2/5", "7/10", "9.5/10", "7/10", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "Danielle Solzman", "Yasser Medina", "Tom Meek", "David Harris", "Ryan Syrek", "Matthew Lucas", "Micheal Compton", "J.
