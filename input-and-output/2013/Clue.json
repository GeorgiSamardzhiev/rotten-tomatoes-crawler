{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Based on the popular board game, this comedy begins at a dinner party hosted by Mr. Boddy (Lee Ving), where he admits to blackmailing his visitors.

Mustard (Martin Mull). When Boddy turns up murdered, all are suspects, and together they try to figure out who is the killer.", "rating": "65", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "Jonathan Lynn", "studio": "PolyGramFilmedEntertainment,Guber-PetersCompany,DebraHillProductions", "theater_date": "Dec 13, 1985", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$13.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Everybody knew what they were doing", "Every single person is perfect", "...a mostly entertaining yet decidedly erratic board-game adaptation.", "If you're open to a weirdly atmospheric comedy that dashes from deadpan to manic and back again, it's a delight.", "You leave it with one conviction: stick with the game.", "It's not the least bit scary or suspenseful but instead quickly grows tedious.
