{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In Chicago, honor-driven Sgt. Eddie Cusack (Chuck Norris) and his team stake out a drug exchange involving notorious drug czar Luis Comacho (Henry Silva). Cusack is caught off guard, however, when rival Mafia kingpin Tony Luna (Mike Genovese) and his disguised crew show up, unleash a torrent of gunfire on Comacho's crew and make off with both cash and cocaine. Now Cusack must fight both gangs -- and corruption in his own department -- in order to stop the drug war.", "rating": "63", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Andrew Davis", "studio": "OrionPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 11, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's still a Chuck Norris movie, of course, but it focuses on strong characters, interesting situations, and an appealingly gritty, urban realism.", "A better than usual entry in the glum Norris filmography.", "Although it's outside his wheelhouse, the script does work in Chuck's favor - it's one of the few films where he actually blends into his role.", "Norris has all the charisma of a railroad tie...", "Though it's your typical formulaic violent action picture, in the model of Dirty Harry, it has more intelligence than expected.", "An engaging feature, smartly cast, while showing a little more sophistication than the genre typically receives. It's too bad Norris couldn't make a few more of these before the Cannon Films curse claimed his marquee value for good.", "This was the 80s when Star Wars pushed all movies to include a robot, no matter how silly it was... if you can look past this ludicrousness, there's a solid third act", "Actually quite good for the type.", "The program, however, is by no means the worst effort Norris has ever participated in and the ending, in which he single-handedly wipes out an entire brigade of bad guys, has a certain heroic charm to it.", "Kickin', jabbin' Chuck Norris actioner.
