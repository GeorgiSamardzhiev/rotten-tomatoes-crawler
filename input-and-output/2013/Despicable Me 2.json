As he struggles with his responsibilities as a father, the Anti-Villain League -- an organization dedicated to fighting evil -- comes calling. The AVL sends Gru on a mission to capture the perpetrator of a spectacular heist, for who would be better than the world's greatest ex-villain to capture the individual who seeks to usurp his power.", "rating": "75", "genre": "Animation/Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Chris Renaud, Pierre Coffin", "studio": "ChrisMeledandri", "theater_date": "Jul 3, 2013", "dvd_date": "Oct 1, 2015", "box_office": "$368.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The humor this time around isn't nearly as juvenile as before, with much of it based on quick snapshots of immaterial gags - such as flashbacks and visualized backstories.", "Kristen Wiig is an absolute wonder as Lucy.", "It's bright, fun, and exists with good intentions. Hard to hate on something like that.", "It has an incessant narrative rhythm and a fruitful direction, an animation that continues to explore the personal style of its predecessor. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The best compliment you can give to Despicable Me 2 may also explain why it doesn't get a higher grade here: it's slight, mass-appealing fun.", "The filmmakers know they have a good thing in the minions, and they figure more prominently in the plot and the film's humor, with sight gags and recurring jokes seamlessly woven into and enhancing the story.", "A slick, inventive and thoroughly entertaining slice of animated nonsense that will enthral kids, amuse adults and rule at the box office.", "It doesn't try to tug at your heart nor terrify you -- it's just happily silly entertainment that genuinely is for the whole family, from tykes to those actually shelling out the money for the tickets.", "If you loved Despicable Me, you'll love this lovable sequel.", "Even though it's not on par with the original, this is a quality sequel that hits all the marks.", "I enjoyed it more than the first one. It's a lot of fun, you're going to enjoy it.", "There's plenty here to keep the kids happy, if only because the film employs Gru's seemingly innumerable yellow minions as a constant source of slapstick humor.", "I even laughed at the fart guns. I never laugh at fart guns.", "Despicable Me 2 earns the right to be slight and nutty because it cultivated those feelings in its predecessor.", "It's hard to tell if directors Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud faced interference on the part of the studio, but the film lacks any discernible spark beyond frenzied goofiness.", "The first act of Despicable Me 2 is so winning and engaging that it's almost a tragedy how the rest of the film falls into bargain basement formula.", "...a passable followup that's sure to amuse and entertain fans of the original.", "Carrell's almost better this way, with his mugging fully abstracted by animation, whereas we start to miss Wiig's actual face.", "Franchises are born more from box-office success than creative necessity, and this sequel has only a fraction of the originality demonstrated by its predecessor.", "Gru's villainy is replaced by a cloying fish-out-of-water mentality that is tortured by overuse of the minions characters.
