{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Detective John McClane (Bruce Willis) is now divorced, alcoholic and jobless after getting fired for his reckless behavior and bad attitude. He is called back into action, however, when a cryptic terrorist (Jeremy Irons) takes New York City hostage in a lethal game of \"Simon Says\" and refuses to speak with anyone but McClane.

[Full Review in Spanish]", "Die Hard: With a Vengeance follows traditional Hollywood sequel rules, but does so with enough impudence so as to not feel superfluous. [Full Review in Spanish]", "McTiernan saves the day by turning the film into a pure Mcguffin. [Full Review in Spanish]", "A highly entertaining sequel that almost surpasses the iconic first film. [Full Review in Spanish]", "For fans who like the first two, it's the last step before the new millennium had its influence. For those who lament where the franchise went, perhaps this is where it all started unraveling.", "Die Hard With A Vengeance is better than Die Hard 2, but not as good as the peerless original.", "The first 40 minutes of the movie contain the most giddy and intoxicating action scenes you'll find in any cinema this summer.", "This third installment is so loud, fast and full of chases that watching it is like being abandoned on a set of roller coaster tracks. You're definitely not bored, but you're not necessarily pleased.", "While it isn't as insultingly dopey as the first two films in this series, this Die Hard is every bit as violent, obscene and implausible.", "Returning to the fray after missing the first sequel, John McTiernan directs with a gleeful disregard for narrative logic, especially in the closing stages. It's cracking entertainment, though.", "On a pure production level, Die Hard With a Vengeance is first-rate work. Its highly elaborate stunts and explosions are expertly choreographed and executed.", "Using the tried-and-true recipe, Die Hard With a Vengeance is a grand slice of bang-up action -- purely Hollywood-style.", "Watching Die Hard 3 is like moving along a conveyor belt with shocks applied to your brain every 10 minutes. It wore me out -- and this from a critic who actually put Die Hard 2 on his \"10 Best\" list five years ago.", "Vengeance proves more technically impressive than truly gripping.", "Some movies ought to be reviewed not by critics but by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms."], "rating": ["8/10", "3/4", "4/4", "3/5", "A-", "", "2.5/5", "", "4/5", "", "3/5", "", "2.5/4", "", "4/5", "3/4", "", "2/4", "2/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Tom Meek", "Jeff Simon", "Leigh Paatsch", "Matt Goldberg", "Luis Martinez", "Virginia Montes", "Alberto Abu\u00edn", "Mikel Zorrilla", "Fred Topel", "Ian Nathan", "Ryan Gilbey", "Michael Wilmington", "Ralph Novak", "David Parkinson", "Dennis King", "Roger Hurlburt", "Gene Siskel", "Malcolm Johnson", "Richard Corliss"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cambridge Day", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Buffalo News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Collider", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sensacine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Showbiz Cheat Sheet", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine"], "date": ["September 11, 2020", "August 28, 2020", "August 14, 2020", "August 14, 2020", "June 11, 2020", "June 11, 2020", "June 11, 2020", "June 11, 2020", "June 11, 2020", "May 20, 2020", "April 2, 2019", "April 2, 2019", "April 2, 2019", "April 2, 2019", "April 2, 2019", "April 2, 2019", "April 2, 2019", "April 2, 2019", "April 2, 2019", "April 2, 2019"]}}
