{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A smug and overly self-assured downhill skier, David Chappellet (Robert Redford), joins the American ski team and quickly makes waves with his arrogant behavior and even flashier maneuvers on the slopes, falling into conflict with the team's coach (Gene Hackman). A rivalry also develops between David and Johnny Creech (Jim McMullan), the man who considered the team's best skier, as both push themselves and each other in a race to the Olympic Games.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Michael Ritchie", "studio": "Wildwood,WildwoodEnterprises", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 1, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Excitingly adept in its presentation of potentially ruinous ambition, Downhill Racer continues to exceed expectations of formula and tone.", "Th[e] astounding ending absolves the film of all its other sins, including a screeching score and choppy scene transitions[.]", "A modest effort but a good one. It may be the first film in history that starts at the top, goes steadily downhill, and still stays interesting along the way.", "The movie avoids the cheerleading approach of today`s sports sagas (Rocky, etc.), but it has a fascinating ending, and is very satisfying.", "This skiing potboiler from Robert Redford's production company, Wildwood, has the whiff of vanity about it.", "A sports movie that tweaks the formula just enough to make a personal, thoughtful film without refuting genre expectation.", "It's the little things that create this film's powerful atmosphere, and as a result the action sequences are all the more gripping.", "One of the great unheralded films of the late '60s.", "Downhill Racer doesn't always work... As a look at how [Robert] Redford's character and those orbiting him spend their time between runs, however, it's superb.", "Several shots are positively astonishing when you consider that they are in no way manipulated or digitally altered, simply a man on skis flying down a hill with a 40-pound film camera in his hands.", "Redford's matinee looks are more than just Hollywood casting in this context; the film never says it in so many words, but it's clear that Chappellet's popularity is as much for his good looks as for his success.", "The sort of somber, minimalist drama that can only be found in the cinema of the late 1960s and early '70s.", "It's better than most sports films since it avoids sentimentality and falsely romanticizing its unsympathetic egotistical hero.", "... the downhill runs are shot and edited with a visceral quality that takes us off the sidelines and into the skier's perspective.", "could be lumped into the convenient category of \"uplifting sports drama,\" but in fact is a challenging deconstruction of all the underdog clichs associated with that genre", "Downhill Racer stands as lean condemnation of the calculating underdog clichs Rocky would bring make the norm.", "An influential and extremely well-done sports film, worth watching even if you don't normally enjoy films of this type.", "An intriguing film that balances skiing and the majesty of Alpine scenery with an absorbing story of hero Robert Redford, young American innocent abroad.", "", "The location skiing sequences, revealing Ritchie's background and interest in documentary styles, are simply astounding, even for those with little interest in the sport."], "rating": ["4/5", "", "", "", "2/5", "7/10", "", "A", "B+", "", "", "3/4", "A", "", "3/4", "3/4", "4/5", "", "2/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "CJ Sheu", "TIME Staff", "Bill Kelley", "Andrew Collins", "Stephen Snart", "Nelson Maddaloni", "Chris Nashawaty", "Keith Phipps", "Amanda Mae Meyncke", "Sean Axmaker", "Matt Brunson", "Dennis Schwartz", "Sean Axmaker", "James Kendrick", "Fernando F.
