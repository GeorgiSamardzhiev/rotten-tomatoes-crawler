Not recommended for the squeamish.", "Vapid, pointless and wholly predictable.", "...the sick kind of comedy that involves laughing at stupid people being ripped in half, but we know there are plenty of you out there.", "In its own morbid little way, this is very much a stand-up-and-cheer -- or shriek, as the case may be -- kind of film.", "This film is the least of the three: it lacks the novelty of the first film and the cleverly morbid humor of the second one.", "Who needs an intriguing story line when an everyday piece of equipment can be used to splatter someone's head like a festering zit?", "With its third outing, the Final Destination series surprisingly gets a second wind.", "YOu know, the \"Final Destination\" movies contain characters who are self-obsessed, cheap, profane and mean-spirited. Maybe that's why it's so much fun to watch them get taken out, one by one.", "Enjoyable threequel which delivers handsomely on the demands of the franchise: an attractive cast, inventive direction, a dark sense of humour and increasingly nasty death sequences.", "You won't be scared one bit, but that's not exactly the point here.
