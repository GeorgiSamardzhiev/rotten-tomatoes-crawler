{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A small, turbulent town in Texas obsesses over their high school football team to an unhealthy degree. When the star tailback, Boobie Miles (Derek Luke), is seriously injured during the first game of the season, all hope is lost, and the town's dormant social problems begin to flare up. It is left to the inspiring abilities of new coach Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton) to instill in the other team members -- and, by proxy, the town itself -- a sense of self-respect and honor.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "1h 57m", "director": "Peter Berg", "studio": "ImagineEntertainment", "theater_date": "Oct 8, 2004", "dvd_date": "Feb 12, 2014", "box_office": "$61.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The game sequences do stand out, but this refreshingly no-frills affair also finds time to question the value of the win-at-all-costs ethos rife in modern sport.", "With Billy Bob Thornton's garrulous Coach Gary Gaines masterminding every play, you'll get caught up in the action even if you can't tell your 'first-and-down' from your 'time-out.'", "It is reminiscent of a war movie...the football impact scenes are brutal and the sound editors have the volume on high for each wince-inducing hit, underscoring the disposability of the boys...", "Every performance in Friday Night Lights rings true.", "It succeeds best as a sadly iconic portrayal of America's love affair with Texas high school football.", "", "So much more than a football movie.", "What Friday Night Lights offers is the perspective that, for the people and young players caught up in this whirlwind, football simultaneously means everything and ultimately nothing.", "Friday Night Lights is a feel-good movie, but it's not real. It's a hard-hitting Hallmark greeting card. It's no wonder it appealed to Larry King %u2014 it's safe, easy, conventional, and feigns incisiveness.", "", "Had Billy Bob Thornton not been so good in so many films, people would be talking about this as his greatest role.", "Few films have shown so powerfully the slashing double edge of sports fever.", "The script spends at least as much time exploring the psychologies of the young players and the problems they face at home as it does rallying the audience behind their efforts on the field.", "A heart-pounding big-screen treatment that captures all the action of a tumultuous season while showing the emotional toll on the players.", "While the atmosphere is excellent, and the general elements all strong, the film sadly fails to give any real insight or depth in regards to explaining the hows and whys of the near fever over the game and its players.", "You'll leave the theater somewhat emotionally spent -- feeling like you've been tackled by a 220-pound linebacker -- but it's worth the ride. One of the best sports movies ever.", "The affecting, gruelling result is less a document of recreational sport than one of obligation and ordeal.", "The movie's principles are seriously out of whack, even as it angles toward a Big Life Lesson about learning to live with falling short of greatness.", "The best sports movie for years, as it's not about sport at all.
