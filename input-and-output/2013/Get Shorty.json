{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Chili Palmer (John Travolta) is a Miami mobster who gets sent by his boss, the psychopathic \"Bones\" Barboni (Dennis Farina), to collect a bad debt from Harry Zimm (Gene Hackman), a Hollywood producer who specializes in cheesy horror films. When Chili meets Harry's leading lady (Rene Russo), the romantic sparks fly. After pitching his own life story as a movie idea, Chili learns that being a mobster and being a Hollywood producer really aren't all that different.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Barry Sonnenfeld", "studio": "JerseyFilms,MetroGoldwynMayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 21, 2015", "box_office": "$68.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The screenplay is brilliant (based on the novel by Elmore Leonard), interweaving fast-paced dialogue with sharp editing and plenty of humor.", "How cool can a mere movie be? A perfect cast and great script, based on a hilariously witty best seller, are key elements. When you add a talented director and let the magic of Hollywood take over, the result is Get Shorty.", "Like the Elmore Leonard novel it adapts, Get Shorty is fast, very funny, minorly caustic, and about as consequential and lasting as the movies Chili himself tries to green-light.", "Get Shorty - for all its critical and commercial acclaim - has never received its due as one of the funniest Hollywood films of modern times.", "Get Shorty belongs to a long line of spoofs that still appeal to Hollywood magic in their very design.", "It's terrifically entertaining.", "", "A pleasing satire on gangsters, hustlers and Hollywood.", "A freewheeling comedy-thriller with the gift of the gab.", "Hollywood has been in love with mobsters since the beginning of movies. But the other side of the equation has seldom been considered. That is, until now.", "This Hollywood is the one we want to believe exists: no film school snots here, no MBA's, no dock-worker philosophers-turned-screenwriters. Just a town full of second-rate swindlers where a clear-eyed racketeer can keep his eye on the ball and rise.", "A drolly offbeat look at Hollywood mores dedicated to the proposition that the best preparation for becoming a film producer is a stint in the criminal underworld.", "An entertaining comedy-thriller adapted by Scott Frank from the Elmore Leonard best-seller and directed with bounce (if not much nuance) by Barry Sonnenfeld.", "A very cool, very fresh, very slick crime flick.", "Everything clicks.", "Sonnenfeld keeps all of this under two hours by cutting the movie at a dazzling clip.", "", "...it seems clear that Get Shorty will appeal mostly to those familiar with the source material - as it has to be more coherent and fleshed out than this.", "It's not an official masterpiece, but like Casablanca, it's a virtually flawless product of the Hollywood machine.", ""], "rating": ["9/10", "", "", "4/4", "", "", "B", "A", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "9/10", "", "", "4/5", "2/4", "4/4", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "David Hunter", "Manohla Dargis", "Matt Brunson", "Chance Solem-Pfeifer", "Carol Buckland", "Owen Gleiberman", "Dennis Schwartz", "", "David Ansen", "Harlan Jacobson", "Variety Staff", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "JoBlo", "", "Jesse Hassenger", "", "David Nusair", "Jeffrey M.
