{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Father Charles O'Malley (Bing Crosby) is an easy-going, golf-playing young priest whose entry into a tough neighborhood parish in midtown Manhattan is viewed with skepticism from all quarters, especially the aging Father Fitzgibbon (Barry Fitzgerald).

Such a screen drama is Going My Way.", "The film is excellent in every way -- acting, production, and evangelical outlook.", "It is a slice of life, illuminated by those flashes of rich detail by which McCarey so often makes beauty out of the commonplace.", "[Bing Crosby's] best film. [Full review in Spanish]", "Crosby will send many a humble cinema-goer away with a new respect for his local parson.", "Although writer/producer/director Leo McCarey bagged three Oscars for this effortless piece of Catholic whimsy, its enduring charm rests with the Oscar-winning performances of Bing Crosby and Barry Fitzgerald.", "It makes you feel happy.
