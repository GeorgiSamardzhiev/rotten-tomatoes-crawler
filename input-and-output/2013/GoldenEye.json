{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When a powerful satellite system falls into the hands of Alec Trevelyan, AKA Agent 006 (Sean Bean), a former ally-turned-enemy, only James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) can save the world from an awesome space weapon that -- in one short pulse -- could destroy the earth! As Bond squares off against his former compatriot, he also battles Trevelyan's stunning ally, Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), an assassin who uses pleasure as her ultimate weapon.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 10m", "director": "Martin Campbell", "studio": "UnitedArtists,DanjaqProductions,MetroGoldwynMayer", "theater_date": "Nov 17, 1995", "dvd_date": "Oct 1, 2016", "box_office": "$106.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["In trying so hard to distance itself from old Bonds, Goldeneye is also now a relic of the post-Cold War era.", "The tank chase through St. Petersburg is perhaps the greatest action scene in any Bond film to date.", "Goldeneye never loses sight what this film is about. The spy game is all about secrets and betrayal and if you are a spy - keep your friends close and your enemies closer. Goldeneye epitomizes that phrase.", "The interplay between Alec and Bond, the cast of oddball characters, the great set pieces. GoldenEye enjoyable for its entire runtime.", "With a dynamite opening reel that showcases the series renewed vigor, GoldenEye is two hours of well-executed thrills, high-tech mayhem and one-of-a-kind comedy.", "Some elements of the story are a little silly - though I love Famke Janssen's portrayal of Xenia Onatopp, her psychopathic, nymphomaniac pathology is slightly comical.", "GoldenEye, the 17th in the series and first in six years, gives 007 a new lease on life. Pierce Brosnan is no Sean Connery, but he is the best Bond since Connery started it all with Dr. No in 1962.", "It's a thoroughly fun film overall, though, and ranks as something of a forgotten gem 25 years later.", "With the ideal Bond, a worthy adversary, gorgeous Bond Babes and a director skilled enough to fully maximize their potential, this stands atop the rest as the best Bond film.", "It contains four or five humorous, intricately choreographed action sequences that -- while not as riveting as similar episodes in True Lies or Die Hard With a Vengeance -- are enjoyable on that idiot level that even critics possess.", "James Bond, the British spy with a taste for the high life and a license to kill, comes back in surprisingly hardy and supple form.", "Brosnan's right there, born to play the part. Perhaps by design, he captures a bit from each predecessor -- the panache of Sean Connery, the cheeky humor of Roger Moore, the serious grit of Timothy Dalton.", "At the most basic, crowd-pleasing level, Goldeneye does the trick.", "Giving 007 a sleek bullet of a BMW instead of his trusty old Aston-Martin isn't exactly going to turn the world of Bond upside down. And, as it turns out, neither does the casting of Brosnan.", "In GoldenEye, [Brosnan's] performance achieves darker, Conneryesque tones. And the movie's relatively realistic take on Bond -- realistic, that is, by the series' flamboyant standards -- helps to give his work weight.", "James Bond's latest outing is big, and it's brash -- in short, it's double-oh-fun.", "Basically, James, GoldenEye wasn't bad. A bit long and not the sexiest or most thrilling Bond movie. But a Bond movie nonetheless, and far from an embarrassment like Moonraker.", "Under the direction of Martin Campbell, GoldenEye is a film that respects its predecessors. No new heights are scaled here, but it's nevertheless a handsome, well-engineered film that gets the job done.", "In GoldenEye, one of the very best of the Bond movies, Pierce Brosnan knows he's trying on something mythical.", "Entropy, the inexorable running down of an energy system, may have overtaken the Bond saga."], "rating": ["", "8/10", "4/5", "5/5", "", "3/5", "", "7/10", "1", "2.5/4", "3/4", "3.5/4", "", "2/4", "3/5", "", "", "3/4", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Fred Topel", "Mike Massie", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "David Hogan", "David Hunter", "PJ Nabarro", "Mary Nemeth", "Sean Collier", "Jeffrey Lyles", "David Baron", "Michael Wilmington", "Doug Thomas", "Desson Thomson", "Steven Rea", "Jay Boyar", "Carol Buckland", "Todd Anthony", "Dave Kehr", "Richard von Busack", "David Ansen"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Showbiz Cheat Sheet", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Confessions From A Geek Mind", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">hoganreviews.co.uk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Maclean&#39;s Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Box Office Prophets", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lyles&#39; Movie Files", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times-Picayune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNN.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MetroActive", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek"], "date": ["November 17, 2020", "September 14, 2020", "July 16, 2020", "January 24, 2020", "November 19, 2019", "October 29, 2019", "October 15, 2019", "August 23, 2019", "November 4, 2015", "November 2, 2015", "October 28, 2015", "October 28, 2015", "October 28, 2015", "October 28, 2015", "October 28, 2015", "October 28, 2015", "October 28, 2015", "October 28, 2015", "October 28, 2015", "October 28, 2015"]}}
