When the unlikely friends meet upper-middle-class debutante Sheila Franklin (Beverly D'Angelo), sparks fly between the country boy and the city girl, and Berger's troupe attempts to keep the young lovers together.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "2h 1m", "director": "Milos Forman", "studio": "CIP", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 11, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["has enough vigor and raucousness to carry it past its various pitfalls while celebrating an age that, far from dawning, had already passed", "It gets my vote as the all-time best rock film and second only to 1935's Top Hat as the all-time best musical.", "Dismissed by some as merely a time capsule piece, the film adaptation of Hair, seen today, proves to be an incredibly relevant and resonant work as well as an immensely entertaining one.", "As it is, Arthur Penn's Alice's Restaurant - a film whose situations and even imagery Hair several times calls to mind - offers from its contemporary vantage-point a far more reflective impression of late-60s counterculture.", "Hair is brilliant and spectacular -- if at times a bit watered-down -- and will please the public, especially those who love its music. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Maybe it's just as well that this version had to wait a decade to be filmed so Forman could be hired to do it. He brings life to the musical form in the same way that West Side Story did, the last time everyone was saying the movie musical was dead.", "Milos Forman's movie version of Hair is every bit as exhilarating and exciting as the original play. What's more, Forman has managed to recreate with amazing accuracy the rebellious mood and irreverent spirit of those confusing times.", "It's the songs that make this film worth watching. Without them, it's a pretty uneven narrative that can be awfully slow at times.", "Milos Forman's screen version of the landmark musical production is uneven, though there's no doubt it would have been better received had been made earlier, during the Vietnam War.", "Hair benefited from the creative freedom of '70s cinema...at its best when it's most creatively subversive...
