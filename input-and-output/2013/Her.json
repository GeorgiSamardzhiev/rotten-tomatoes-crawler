{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A sensitive and soulful man earns a living by writing personal letters for other people. Left heartbroken after his marriage ends, Theodore (Joaquin Phoenix) becomes fascinated with a new operating system which reportedly develops into an intuitive and unique entity in its own right. He starts the program and meets \"Samantha\" (Scarlett Johansson), whose bright voice reveals a sensitive, playful personality. Though \"friends\" initially, the relationship soon deepens into love.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Special Interest/Romance", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "Spike Jonze", "studio": "AnnapurnaPictures", "theater_date": "Jan 10, 2014", "dvd_date": "Sep 28, 2015", "box_office": "$25.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Anyway, if Jonze's concern is presumably with humanity's future and fate, Samantha is largely a diversion, a gimmick.", "An oddball story, but it's not an oddball film. It is ripe with real human emotion and commentary on a generation's reliance on technology at the cost of social interaction.", "Spike Jonze has a brilliant eye for style and inventiveness, taking on a conventional quasi-futuristic narrative and giving it a heart and a philosophical message.", "Had Samantha taken a downward spiraling turn toward the HAL 9000 spectrum of robots, this movie could have been exciting.", "Tender, soulful, and thought provoking, Spike Jonze's film uses its bizarre sci-fi scenario to both comment on the modern reliance on technology as well as impart wisdom about the state of human relationships.", "I wasn't blown away by Her. I was enveloped by it.", "A sweet, delicate story, that can be emotionally pummeling while never losing its fundamental optimism.", "An unconventional way of telling an age-old story that works so well that you forget about its unconventionality as its humanity washes over you.", "It is a romantic drama bordering on the eccentric and is not afraid to show the psychological depth of human relationships. [Full review in Spanish]", "...the film excels in its terrific execution and intriguing framework; and despite the technological trappings and high concept, HER is filled with humanity.", "Her has the most richly genuine denouement, a sincere sense of awakening where a stunted character recognizes his potential.", "Overall, Her is a beautiful film - wonderful acting, great story and dreamy soundtrack. Miss it and you'll miss out.", "Her wasn't as fantastically profound emotionally as the similarly toned Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. It lopes a bit in the middle when you want it to run.", "One of the most deeply felt and profoundly wise love stories to come along in a long time.", "The story of a man falling in love with his computer is an absurd sitcom-ready premise, but through Spike Jonze's vision it's looked at in a disarming and surprisingly sincere light.", "The first rush of new love feels as real and euphoric as any traditional relationship and slowly sours into disaffection and jealousy with just as much familiarity.", "Her is an intelligent and beautiful achievement in science fictional romance; a film about human fragility and the strangest aspirations of platonic love. [Full review in Spanish]", "There are so many rich nuances in this film that I could mull over and contemplate with, it's definitely one of those films that I'd like to watch more than once just to absorb it all again.", "Beginning life as a quirky rom-com before turning into something far greater and more profound, Jonze's Her puts forward a convincing and compelling defense of technology's growing dominion over our everyday lives.", "A bizarre little concoction that proves to be rather sweet and charming."], "rating": ["", "4/5", "3.5/4", "3/10", "", "4.0/4", "A", "", "8/10", "", "4.2/5", "4.5/5", "B+", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "9/10", "4.5/5", "4/5", "B+"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Richard Crouse", "Wesley Lovell", "Mike Massie", "Film Companion Staff", "Richard Propes", "Brent McKnight", "Damond Fudge", "Yasser Medina", "Jim Ross", "David Harris", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Ryan Syrek", "Matthew Lucas", "C.J.
