{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this visually arresting martial arts epic set in ancient China, an unnamed fighter (Jet Li) is being honored for defeating three of the king's most dangerous enemies. When Nameless recounts his battles with the assassins -- Broken Sword (Tony Leung Chiu Wai), Flying Snow (Maggie Cheung Man-yuk) and Moon (Zhang Ziyi) -- the king begins to question some of the details. As Nameless goes on, the king challenges the tales, interjecting his own take on these perhaps suspect version of events.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Art House & International/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Yimou Zhang", "studio": "BeijingNewPictureFilmCo.", "theater_date": "Aug 27, 2004", "dvd_date": "Aug 26, 2016", "box_office": "$53.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The drama and ideas are not sufficiently compelling to sustain the martial arts.

And one of the best wuxia films of all time. Simply gorgeous. [Full review in Spanish]", "It is entirely possible that this is the single most beautiful film of the 2000s.", "An acceptable adventure that features some breathtaking action sequences and exquisite cinematography.", "Until the final 15 minutes of its deceptively short hour-and-a-half running time, Hero is a marvel, one of the best films to be released in the United States this year. It concludes, however, on a note both emotionally unsatisfying and morally idiotic.", "If it were merely lovely and silly, that would be fine, but Hero wants to be more than merely kung fu fun. It has a message.", "As they move through the martial-arts sequences, the performers leave the impression that the laws of gravity are subject to amendment. The rules of love and war -- all's fair -- are, Hero makes clear, immutable.", "The result is not so much a historical epic as a kind of highly determined ballet: dreamy with bloodless violence, relying less on shades of character than on magnificence of gesture.", "The austerity of Hero makes you realize how cluttered other action movies are.", "What makes Hero special is that it has so much more going for it than just the superb fight sequences. There are a satisfyingly complex plot, passionate romance, cool special effects and strong performances.", "Sumptuous and breath-catching, Hero blends the elegance of fine visual art with the more familiar cinematic jollies of attractive people engaged in crunching punch-ups.", "Zhang Yimou's Hero is a true martial arts epic -- a spectacle of movement, color and sound that will leave you awe-struck.", "The result is both thrilling and thoughtful, offering imaginative action sequences as it considers questions of loyalty and the individual's role in history.", "Intoxicatingly beautiful, structurally enigmatic and decidedly brief.", "As a technical achievement, Hero finds Zhang at the height of his powers, effortlessly expanding into complex genre filmmaking without losing his command. But in light of his earlier work, the film continues a sharp decline in urgency.", "Gorgeous martial arts movie for older kids.", "Zhang weaves a complex and interesting story but the ultimate strength of Hero is its poetic beauty.", "When we are not left agog by the pristine production design and costuming, we marvel at the various staged conflicts, each one bringing a new level of proficiency and polish to an already overripe genre.", "A visually stunning martial arts epic in the wuxia tradition."], "rating": ["", "", "4.5/5", "4/5", "B-", "", "", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "4.5/5", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Diane Carson", "Fico Cangiano", "Tim Brayton", "Micheal Compton", "Christopher Orr", "Dorothy Woodend", "Joanne Kaufman", "Anthony Lane", "David Edelstein", "Leah Rozen", "", "Clare Pfeiffer Ramsey", "Hank Sartin", "Mike Goodridge", "Scott Tobias", "Liz Perle", "Ryan Cracknell", "Bill Gibron", "Joe Lozito"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KDHX (St. Louis)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineXpress Podcast", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternate Ending", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New Republic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Tyee (British Columbia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slate", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro Times (Detroit, MI)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Views", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">PopMatters", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Big Picture Big Sound"], "date": ["February 15, 2021", "February 12, 2021", "May 12, 2020", "January 30, 2020", "November 16, 2019", "January 5, 2018", "August 24, 2017", "March 18, 2014", "August 5, 2013", "August 5, 2013", "August 5, 2013", "August 5, 2013", "August 5, 2013", "August 5, 2013", "August 5, 2013", "August 5, 2013", "January 2, 2011", "September 27, 2009", "September 17, 2009", "October 18, 2008"]}}
