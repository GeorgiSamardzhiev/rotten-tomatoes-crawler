{"metadata": {"synopsis": "As his wedding day approaches, Peter Klaven (Paul Rudd) realizes he has no one to act as his best man. Through a series of \"man-dates,\" he finds Sydney Fife (Jason Segel), and the pair become instant friends.

[Full review in Spanish]", "For our era, Rudd is a perfect everyman. I enjoyed Segel's antics, but liked Rashida Jones even more. A few leading roles and she would be the Doris Day of a new age.", "Rudd and Segal's onscreen chemistry is palpable, and combined with some fantastic bit-players, the film delivers easy, if somewhat puerile laughs.", "That movies from this brand will have \"heart\" is now a given, but the variety Rudd provides here is singular.", "[T]his unpretentious crowd-pleaser is still punchy enough to send packed theaters reeling in riotous laughter.", "One of the better recent 'buddy comedies' and one if you're in the mood to laugh, you definitely won't regret showing a little love.", "Rudd and Segel share genuine chemistry and the early scenes in which their bromance blossoms are tinged with recognisable humour; the dumb nicknames; the inexplicable use of silly voices; the embarrassingly out-dated 'man slang'.", "If Rudd steals the show, Segel deserves props for downplaying Sydney's regressiveness.", "It's hard not to like this witty, well-made celebration of friendship in which two very different guys come to know and appreciate each other.", "For both men though, it's the sincerity lurking just beneath the bravado which sets the film apart from the abrasive comedy it might have been.", "At the end of the day it is a pretty formulaic bromantic comedy, and the little bit of a twist it has can't hide that fact. But it's done really, really well and that counts for a lot.", "The film is a microcosm of us all, guys - raucous, juvenile and puerile on the outside, but tender, sweet and vulnerable in our hearts.", "Pays respect to the crucial role male bonding plays in adulthood...", "We all know where the film is heading, but that's hardly the point. Rudd and Segel are such entertaining guides you're willing to follow them anywhere.", "Thanks to the incredible chemistry of its two leads, I Love You, Man stands as one of the best buddy comedies since Swingers.", "Feel the man love with I Love You, Man, a constantly entertaining comedy about marriage, love, and friendship which is aimed towards adults."], "rating": ["5/10", "3.0/4", "1.5/4", "2.5/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "", "", "7.5/10", "3/5", "4/5", "3.5/5", "3/5", "7.5/10", "", "", "4/5", "3.5/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Matthew Lucas", "Leigh Paatsch", "Laura Hiros", "Dan DiNicola", "Joanna Hunkin", "Justin Stewart", "Paul Brunick", "Jeffrey Lyles", "Ali Gray", "Ben Kenigsberg", "Neil Pond", "Stella Papamichael", "Joshua Starnes", "Simon Foster", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Simon Miraudo", "Jason Zingale", "Matthew Pejkovic"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rinc\u00f3n de cine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Daily Gazette (Schenectady, NY)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Zealand Herald", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Stop Smiling", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Comment Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lyles&#39; Movie Files", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheShiznit.co.uk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out Chicago", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">American Profile", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Digital Spy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ComingSoon.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">sbs.com.au", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Quickflix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bullz-Eye.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Matt&#39;s Movie Reviews"], "date": ["November 28, 2020", "September 11, 2020", "June 6, 2019", "July 5, 2018", "March 20, 2018", "February 3, 2018", "June 22, 2016", "May 17, 2016", "October 20, 2014", "March 20, 2013", "September 29, 2012", "April 9, 2012", "September 29, 2011", "July 14, 2011", "March 27, 2011", "March 9, 2011", "January 4, 2011", "October 27, 2010", "July 6, 2010", "July 6, 2010"]}}
