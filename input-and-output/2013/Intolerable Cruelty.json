{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Miles Massey (George Clooney) is an exceptional divorce lawyer who specializes in saving cheating husbands from having to pay expensive settlements. Unchallenged, he wearies of his life -- until he meets the cunning Marylin Rexroth (Catherine Zeta-Jones). When Massey's representation of her husband in court denies her any divorce compensation, Marylin vows to get revenge, enlisting the help of an oil baron (Billy Bob Thornton), and the two vie for the advantage in a flirtatious duel of wits.", "rating": "75", "genre": "Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Joel Coen", "studio": "ImagineEntertainment,TheKLLine,AlphavilleFilms", "theater_date": "Oct 10, 2003", "dvd_date": "Jul 22, 2015", "box_office": "$35.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A bland studio comedy with some genuinely terrific bits.", "Glitz, glamour, comedy and Clooney and [&#8232;Catherine] Zeta-Jones.

The Coens come closer to the zaniness of their greatest comedy, Raising Arizona, then they have in all of their movies since then.", "Despite the inconsistent script and low tone, this has many funny moments.
