{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Plagued with worry and insomnia since saving New York from destruction, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), now, is more dependent on the suits that give him his Iron Man persona -- so much so that every aspect of his life is affected, including his relationship with Pepper (Gwyneth Paltrow). After a malevolent enemy known as the Mandarin (Ben Kingsley) reduces his personal world to rubble, Tony must rely solely on instinct and ingenuity to avenge his losses and protect the people he loves.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 10m", "director": "Shane Black", "studio": "MarvelStudios", "theater_date": "May 3, 2013", "dvd_date": "Nov 22, 2015", "box_office": "$409.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["State-of-the-art special effects can't compensate for the lackluster antagonist or the absence of an inspired plot.", "You're going to be entertained and, even if the meandering plot drives you crazy, it's hard to imagine you won't leave the film at least being modestly entertained.", "Action and banter propel the entire film forward, and there's a bleak, grim center to the glossy, candy shell that provides added depth.", "Iron Man 3 is pure Iron Man fun in the style we've become accustomed to. Downey, Jr. keeps up the charm, even through all of his snarky comments, while bringing a depth to the scenes concerning his post-Avengers PTSD.", "Iron Man 3 is an enjoyable, energetic and amazing summer entertainment, with enough surprises to send you to buy a ticket and see it again. [Full review in Spanish]", "Overall, the movie was great.", "I thoroughly enjoyed it.", "Ultimately, empty suits fighting anonymous henchmen is still an empty spectacle, and it happens to be at odds with Stark's journey in the film.", "Iron Man 3 is ironclad -- it rocks!", "Iron Man 3 is action-packed, funny and entertaining.", "Iron Man 3 is still marred by that disconnect between the subversive wit of Stark's dialogue and the clich\u00e9d tedium of the action.", "This movie risks a most interesting mix of intense action, humor, and genuine character development.", "This is biggest, boldest Iron Man  yet.", "The twist of The Mandarin is...so silly it just didn't work and felt a little insulting to the viewers", "While Tony Stark will live on as Iron Man, Iron Man 3 serves as a satisfying conclusion to his personal story.", "A sporadically entertaining but ultimately underwhelming endeavor. Coming on the heels of The Avengers, this is a film that tries too hard to capture the same magic.", "The story is more convoluted than the previous installments and it runs a bit slow in the middle, but it remains entertaining.", "[IM3 features] the psychological damage that most superheroes are denied on film, the type of damage they are more likely to receive than any grave physical injury.", "What it doesn't offer is much in the way of originality -- or lucidity.", "I liked this film far more than many say they do ... It reinterprets many ... elements, ...
