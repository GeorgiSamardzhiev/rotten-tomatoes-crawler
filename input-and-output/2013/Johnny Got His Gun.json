{"metadata": {"synopsis": "War has plunged Army soldier Joe Bonham (Timothy Bottoms) into an unending nightmare. Hit by an artillery shell in World War I, Joe has suffered injuries that have all but erased his humanity: he's lost his sight, speech, hearing and sense of smell. But he still has the ability to think and remember, which, in the end, may be more a curse than a blessing. Trapped in his body, Joe realizes there's only one way out of his misery: death. Can he get a sympathetic nurse to help him?", "rating": "67", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Dalton Trumbo", "studio": "WorldEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 22, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Problems aside, there's a cumulative power to the material and an idea that's impossible to ignore.", "[Trumbo's] filmmaking is frugal -- jump-cuts state the passage of time, a languid fade to yellow signifies solar warmth.", "Trumbo, directing his first film, drives home his points in a somewhat obvious, often awkward fashion that is overly talky, but so disquieting is his story and the reality underlying it that it is difficult not to be moved by the film.", "Sadly, time has not made this story any less relevant or potent.", "Dalton Trumbo (member of the Hollywood Ten) sole directing effort is one of the most hauntingly powerful anti-war film made, an experimental work that's effective as realistic portrait of war's damages as well as metaphoric, quasi-religious journey.", "strong historical and literate adaptation of a truly remarkable anti-war classic", "a sobering, grueling look at us", "The primal power of the story -- a young man trying to find some sense in what's happened to him -- prevails.", "Ainda que contenha algumas seqncias memorveis e angustie pela situao de seu protagonista, este nico trabalho deTrumbo na direo  bvio tanto em sua mensagem anti-belicista quanto em sua abordagem fantasiosa.", "The film is often sentimental, sometimes brilliant as well as horrifying, and it is intriguing to speculate on what Buuel, whom Trumbo originally wanted to direct, would have made of it.", "", "Although Mr. Trumbo is primarily a screenwriter, screenwriting is only the worst of the film's several failures.", "Instead of belaboring ironic points about the \"war to end war,\" Trumbo remains stubbornly on the human level.", "", "Johnny Got His Gun, Dalton Trumbo's 30-year-old novel, is a milestone in anti-war literature. His movie version, however, is less a milestone than it is a fumbling attempt at getting the same impact on film.", "Trumbo successfully turns Johnny into the living embodiment of the horror and futility of war -- but also of the unquenchable resilience of the human spirit.", "A heartbreaking anti-war allegory that's a bit slow, yet stills commands your attention. Donald Sutherland as a hippie Jesus is a bit too much, though.", "", "This grim soldier's tale has some bad acting and some overextended melodrama, but eventually it hits its stride and becomes a gripping drama.", ""], "rating": ["4.5/5", "", "2/4", "4/5", "A-", "B+", "3.5/5", "4/5", "2/5", "", "2/5", "2/5", "4/4", "4/5", "", "5/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3/4", "1/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Ken Hanke", "Fernando F.
