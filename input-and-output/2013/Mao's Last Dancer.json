You'll view Li's progression as an international artist as he becomes one of the best ballet dancers in the world.", "Powerfully compelling and passionate, MAO'S LAST DANCER is a celebration of the human spirit, aiming for the heart and hitting it every time.", "a sweeping story that has many ups and downs, with some pretty noticeable changes in tone and pace", "", "", "Missteps prevent ballet drama from reaching great heights.", "...somehow makes the extraordinary true story it's based on seem like common corn while succeeding in modest ways.", "Woefully creaky and corny.", "The script is far too melodramatic, and the performances ... are hamfisted and overwrought.", "Mao's Last Dancer is such a profoundly moving story, it's hard not to get drawn in as Li must decide how much he's willing to sacrifice for his American dream.", "Debuting actor Chi Cao's athleticism is the movie's most striking element.", "Ballet is kinda like ice hockey. It's more impressive when you're up close at the real deal. When you're 30 yards away, the snap of a slipper after a 90-lb ballerina lands a glissade is just as impressive as a 290-lb hockey goon hitting the boards.", "Mao's Last Dancer is an epic tale of love and betrayal, triumph and heartbreak, that captures the real-life drama and emotion of one man's search for freedom. Well, it almost is.", "Whenever Beresford concerns himself with politics or, even worse, personal drama, Dancer falls limply to the ground.", "Bruce Beresford's biopic of Li Cunxin, the Chinese ballet dancer who defected while on a student visa in Houston in 1981, is sometimes the movie equivalent of Oscar Meyer cold cuts. But the dancing is pure caviar.", "The movie works, thanks in large part to Chi's performance.", "Feel-good movie about a Chinese dancer presses all the right buttons.", "Let the trumpets blare for artistic freedom of expression that is perfectly reflected in this uplifting and moving biopic.", "Beresford knows the only way to deal with schmaltz is to just go ahead and embrace it."], "rating": ["2.5/4", "4/4", "", "3.5/5", "B", "2/4", "3.5", "8", "C-", "2/4", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "2/4", "2/5", "", "3/4", "", "3/4", "4/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Sarah Knight Adamson", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Kevin Carr", "Nell Minow", "Rene Rodriguez", "Don Groves", "Philip Martin", "Nick Schager", "Sean P.
