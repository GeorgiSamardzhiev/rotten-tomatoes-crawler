{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Ever since he was a kid monster, Mike Wazowski (Billy Crystal) has dreamed of becoming a Scarer. To make his dream a reality, he enrolls at Monsters University. During his first semester, he meets Sulley (John Goodman), a natural-born Scarer. Sulley and Mike engage in a fierce rivalry that ultimately gets them both kicked out of MU's elite Scare Program. To make things right, Mike and Sulley -- along with a bunch of misfit monsters -- will have to learn to work together.", "rating": "80", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Animation/Comedy/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Dan Scanlon", "studio": "PixarAnimationStudios", "theater_date": "Jun 21, 2013", "dvd_date": "Aug 31, 2016", "box_office": "$268.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Lacks the substantial level of unbridled creativity and emotional punch found in its predecessor.", "Randy Newman's original music gives the film a heartfelt yet fun aura.", "What follows is a perfectly pleasant pile of shenanigans that never once outstays its welcome.", "Straight \"A's\" across the board, it's time to matriculate in Monsters University!", "The excellent storytelling and pathos Pixar is so celebrated for is missing - and the film suffers as a result.", "It is the kid friendly equivalent of a frat comedy, albeit with the genuine heart of a coming of age buddy pic.", "An amusing prequel to 2001's Monsters, Inc.", "A decent enough way to pass the time, but it pales in comparison to the modern classics that Pixar has delivered before.", "Overall, Monsters University is a very pleasant Pixar movie and one... that subverts traditional narrative quite a bit for the kind of story it is telling.", "The latest from Pixar is a charming endeavor that's sure to please children while sprinkling in just enough to keep the adults interested as well.", "Monsters University's diverse and eclectic menagerie of monstrosities will certainly entertain younger audiences, whilst parents and older viewers will still find the odd subtle adult joke here and there.", "The main reason I think the film works is that it sends out a harsh but necessary lesson for kids.", "With no shortage of exceptional talent, this movie will satisfy any Pixar fan. Though it may not knock their M.U. emblazoned hats off.", "The film has a good script and some great set pieces, as well as the usual selection of monsters that look like people you know.", "It feels like a good Disney movie. It doesn't have that magical spark that we've seen in previous Pixar movies, but it's not bad. It's enjoyable.", "Monsters University doesn't keep the faith, laying the creatures on thick and fast. It's not that the new crowd aren't fun, but they're a distraction", "This is the ingenuity and warmth we love in Pixar movies, and long may it remain.", "Mike and Sully went to college; both \"scare majors.\" But Sully's a talented, no-work-ethic scare-scion, and little Mike's an overachiever with no scare-ability. Teamwork!", "Great Randy Newman score, some inspired sight gags, and a sure way to let your 6-year-old learn early on that school is all about cliques, and that the people who tend to run in them are often jerks.", "Breezy and charming enough to warrant a viewing - especially for younger audiences."], "rating": ["8/10", "3.0/4", "3/5", "", "3.5/5", "", "3/4", "2.5/4", "B-", "B", "3/5", "8/10", "", "3/5", "", "3.5/5", "", "3.5/5", "3/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Leigh Paatsch", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Leslie Combemale", "Matt Brunson", "Matthew Lucas", "Rachel Wagner", "Micheal Compton", "Patrick Gamble", "Jennifer Heaton", "Sarah Gopaul", "Camilla Long", "Andre Meadows", "Amber Wilkinson", "Kristian M.
