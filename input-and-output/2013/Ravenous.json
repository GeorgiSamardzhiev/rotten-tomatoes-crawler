{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Upon receiving reports of missing persons at Fort Spencer, a remote Army outpost on the Western frontier, Capt. John Boyd (Guy Pearce) investigates. After arriving at his new post, Boyd and his regiment aid a wounded frontiersman, F.W. Colghoun (Robert Carlyle), who recounts a horrifying tale of a wagon train murdered by its supposed guide -- a vicious U.S. Army colonel gone rogue. Fearing the worst, the regiment heads out into the wilderness to verify Colghoun's gruesome claims.", "rating": "48", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Horror", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Antonia Bird", "studio": "TwentiethCenturyFox,ETICFilms,HeydayFilms,Fox2000Pictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 3, 2016", "box_office": "$2.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Cannibalism as a metaphor for homosexuality may not seem like the most obvious path to take, but it makes Ravenous a fiendishly interesting entry into the cannibalism sub-genre.", "An idiosyncratic cannibal masterpiece about the ceaselessness of American violence.", "The film offers nothing to sharpen your teeth with. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Ravenous will doubtless find some sort of cult following, but that cult will be following a lousy, ill-conceived movie.", "A disproportionate film. [Full Review in Spanish]", "I]f anyone could make a good adaptation of either of Lansdale's Jonah Hex comic mini-series or his great standard \"Incident On and Off a Mountain Road,\" it's Bird and Griffin.", "It's such an odd and compelling mixture of horror and subtle comedy, with some really weird music cues throughout to put the audience in a state of unease, perfect for someone losing their mind from eating people.", "Antonia Bird's pitch black comedy is a patchily hilarious triumph. But the queasy and squeamish have been warned.", "It's too muddled to be considered a success, but the fact that such an uncompromisingly mean, loopy film can still be made within the studio system will be reason enough for some people -- and you know who you are -- to celebrate.", "Ravenous is a stupid black comedy set in the same place and the same year but more a Western version of Night of the Living Dead.", "It's \"Eating Raoul\" in buckskins. But the movie is also coarse and bloody and uses far too many horror movie tricks, like the shock of the mutilated body or the unexpected plasma squirt.", "... the definitive frontier cannibal movie. ... a gruesome survival thriller with a crimson-hued streak of black humor and an elemental hint of the supernatural.", "It's a layered and very unique satire on America's consumption of the world...", "Imagine a film that makes A Modest Proposal-style satire out of Dracula's gothic horror tropes in the spaghetti western milieu of The Great Silence. It's a pitch-black comedy about Manifest Destiny and cannibal frontiersmen.", "'He was licking me!' That plaintive, disgusted wail is pretty unforgettable once you've seen this one-of-a-kind tongue-in-cheek/blood-in-mouth historical horror movie that has garnered an appreciative cult audience...", "Ravenous is unlike anything else, and even if it's not to my own specific taste, I have great respect for its unrepentant weirdness.", "There's an awkwardness to Ravenous' more violent scenes, and while Carlyle and Jones give zesty performances, the rest of the supporting cast is quirky to a fault.", "\"Ravenous\" could have turned out to be much more than what it ended up becoming, but thanks to an inability to take advantage of its creepy premise, all we get is a monotonous, forgettable, and worst of all, boring horror film.", "More than just a gory horror film in period dress, though it bears saying over and over again that even as a simple Western-horror hybrid, this is pretty great.", "[A]ll the blood in bloody Ravenous is just so much barbecue sauce."], "rating": ["3.5/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "2.5/4", "", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "2/4", "3/5", "2.5/5", "8/10", "C-"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Trace Thurman", "Evan Dossey", "Clar\u00edn Staff", "Stephen Thompson", "Adolfo C.
