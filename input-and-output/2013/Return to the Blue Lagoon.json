{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When widow Sarah Hargrave (Lisa Pelikan) washes ashore on a tropical island with her daughter and adopted son, she learns how to survive and raise the two children on her own. After her death, the kids -- Lilli (Milla Jovovich) and Richard (Brian Krause) -- are forced to continue their uncivilized lives without any parental guidance, and, as they enter young adulthood, they begin to fall in love. Their Eden-like existence is threatened, however, when outsiders arrive on the island.", "rating": "0", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "William Graham", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$2.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Director Graham opts to virtually remake a film that was widely disparaged by critics, again presenting visualizations of puberty with a controversially youthful cast.", "A textbook example of a disaster that amazingly manages not only to contain bad acting and an appalling script, but also some of the most unconvincing love scenes ever committed to film.", "The lagoon is the locale to which this new movie disastrously returns.", "Graham paints a picture of love that is tediously sexist. One for pervs and frustrated holidaymakers only.", "The travelogue-style photography is soothing, the bodies are pretty and the music isn't offensive, but feature-length movies can't survive on the ingredients for a standard airline commercial.", "Things are pretty much the same for the semi-nude kids in this movie as they were for the semi-nude kids in the first Blue Lagoon.", "The movie is occasionally cutesy. That's the worst of it. You can't call it gross, but it is cutesy.", "Return to the Blue Lagoon is neither campy enough to be howlingly funny nor prurient enough to be provocative.", "Jovovich is a beauty recalling the very young Myrna Loy, Krause is boyishly handsome; both are capable and should survive this particular shipwreck.", "When an old scallawag spies on Lilli bathing naked in a waterfall, we civilized viewers are primed to condemn him. But we're all scallawags here.", "At 15 years of age, I wanted to live inside this screen world of freedom and loinclothed abandon. Today, I wanted these kids to fall on some coral.", "Even the soft porn is a total yawn.", "A movie whose best features are its lush tropical vistas has evident limitations.", "Return to the Blue Lagoon is a pointless spinoff of the 1980 hit, which was itself a remake of a 1949 British pic.", "", "Like a sex education film made by semi-liberated nuns, the movie keeps its sticky truths hidden beneath a veneer of leering cleanliness.", "", "", "", "Not even teen lust can justify watching this film."], "rating": ["2/10", "1/5", "", "2/5", "1/4", "1/5", "2/4", "2/4", "", "1/4", "D", "1/5", "2/4", "", "0/5", "", "1/5", "1/5", "0/5", "0/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Jo Berry", "Bill von Maurer", "Miranda Sawyer", "John Hartl", "Jay Boyar", "Lou Cedrone", "Carrie Rickey", "Kevin Thomas", "Mark Caro", "Brian Orndorf", "", "", "Variety Staff", "Jake Euker", "Mark Kermode", "Emanuel Levy", "Thomas Delapa", "Nicolas Lacroix", "Alex Sandell"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">BrianOrndorf.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">F5 (Wichita, KS)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boulder Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EnPrimeur.ca", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Juicy Cerebellum"], "date": ["September 24, 2020", "July 25, 2014", "July 11, 2014", "May 21, 2013", "May 21, 2013", "May 21, 2013", "May 21, 2013", "May 21, 2013", "May 21, 2013", "May 21, 2013", "August 2, 2011", "August 3, 2009", "July 31, 2009", "March 26, 2009", "February 18, 2007", "February 9, 2006", "June 25, 2005", "April 13, 2005", "January 5, 2004", "November 4, 2003"]}}
