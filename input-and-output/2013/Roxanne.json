{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this modern take on Edmond Rostand's classic play \"Cyrano de Bergerac,\" C. D. Bales (Steve Martin) is the witty, intelligent and brave fire chief of a small Pacific Northwest town who, due to the size of his enormous nose, declines to pursue the girl of his dreams, lovely Roxanne Kowalski (Daryl Hannah). Instead, when his shy underling Chris McConnell (Rick Rossovich) becomes smitten with Roxanne, Bales feeds the handsome young man the words of love to win her heart.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Fred Schepisi", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$34.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Sadly, most of the humor falls completely flat.", "It manages to entertain. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Martin is very funny in the role, and most ingenious about finding modern equivalents for the various bits of business in the original play. Yet the nagging question remains: Why?", "Light and likable, with hearts unabashedly all over its sleeves, Roxanne is a winning romantic comedy whose appeal should cross age barriers and backgrounds -- giving it an across-the-board promise.", "Witty, sweet, utterly delightful.", "Roxanne has a way of making you feel good even though you know it may be the corniest movie you've seen. Filled with romance, from its plot to the scenery, Roxanne makes no apologies for its sweet fervor.", "Charming '80s romantic comedy has innuendo, swearing.", "...an entertaining yet undeniably forgettable romcom that benefits substantially from the stars' charismatic work.", "for all the things this movie is, it's probably Martin's fault.", "It's difficult to call a movie this light and insubstantial a classic, but it's as likeable as ever more than two decades after its initial release.", "another in a long line of Cyrano De Bergerac adaptations but easily one of the very best", "I'd call it reasonably successful, but I can't get excited about it.", "It's a neat trick, being Steve Martin. He's so good; his movies will get even better.", "In an era when romance seems to have taken second place to sex, it's heartwarming to see a film like Roxanne bring back the loveliness of love.", "In the end it's hopelessly sappy stuff.", "The film's success rests firmly with Martin. He wrote the warm-hearted script and delivers a sparkling performance of physical and verbal gymnastics that he hasn't been able to match since.", "", "Very good adaptation of Cyrano with Steve Martin in one his best roles.", "Far and away [Martin's] richest film to date, lyrical, sweet-natured, touching, and very, very funny.", ""], "rating": ["5/10", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "", "4/5", "2.5/4", "1.5/4", "8", "4/5", "3/5", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "4/5", "5/5", "", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "\u00c1ngel Luis Inurria", "Richard Freedman", "Duane Byrge", "Jason Best", "Cathy Burke", "Betsy Bozdech", "David Nusair", "Walter Chaw", "Brian Webster", "Jason McKiernan", "Ken Hanke", "Richard Corliss", "", "Variety Staff", "", "David Kaplan", "Steve Crum", "Geoff Andrew", "Chuck O&#39;Leary"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newhouse News Service", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Talk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">United Press International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Freak Central", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Apollo Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmcritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Kaplan vs. Kaplan", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dispatch-Tribune Newspapers", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fantastica Daily"], "date": ["September 7, 2020", "April 22, 2020", "November 15, 2019", "June 20, 2017", "December 5, 2016", "November 8, 2016", "October 8, 2013", "November 14, 2009", "June 24, 2009", "May 7, 2009", "April 29, 2009", "April 29, 2009", "February 2, 2009", "February 2, 2009", "February 2, 2009", "February 2, 2009", "March 1, 2008", "February 20, 2007", "June 24, 2006", "September 1, 2005"]}}
