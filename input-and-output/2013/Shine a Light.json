As long as the Stones are ambulatory, they're ageless.", "Unanswered question: If this is what Keith Richards' face looks like when he goes on stage, what does he look like when he gets up in the morning?", "Note to self: Need more yoga ASAP.", "Sparkles like polished ember encasing dinosaur DNA, but Scorsese's best jukeboxes have little use for such reverence", "It's unfortunate that the unfairest criticism one can level at Shine a Light is arguably the most legitimate as well: it's no Gimme Shelter", "More than a concert film, Scorsese's Shine a Light not only throws yet another spotlight on the rockers but also carves out a story to pay tribute to the \"Satisfaction\" musicians.", "A whirlwind demo of technical proficiency.
