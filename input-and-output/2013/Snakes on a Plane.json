Jackson's ridiculous performance as the FBI agent who just wants to kick some asp is guilty-pleasure gold.", "The fact is, the film isn't as bad as it wants to be, which isn't a good thing if you are going for that campy B horror movie feel.", "The giddy awfulness of it all that makes it what it is - a wildly entertaining bad movie.", "This is a good-looking film, and Jackson is just so much fun to watch. The other horror films that are out there? This one's a slither above them all.", "A movie about snakes on a plane does not need to be straightforward; it only has a shot if it is either genuinely scary or so incredibly over the top it's funny. Snakes on a Plane is neither, but maybe Snakes on a Boat will be better.", "Few studio-supported films match its B-movie nirvana of stupid-goodness. It's exactly what its title suggests and more ? the proof in the primal levels ranging from basic exploited fears to the crowd?s roaring reactions and howls of humor or horror.", "A snarky genre exercise and its own late-night sketch parody, it parades nothing so much as the force of the public's lowered expectations", "Although the film's production company New Line retooled the movie from a PG-13 to an R rating with ideas and dialogue from web fans, \"Snakes On A Plane\" is a boring ride.", "", "", "", "It hurts so good.
