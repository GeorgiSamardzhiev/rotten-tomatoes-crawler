{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Virgil Starkwell (Woody Allen) is intent on becoming a notorious bank robber. Unfortunately for Virgil and his not-so-budding career, he is completely incompetent. Presented in mockumentary format, the film features interviews with those who know Virgil best, including his wife, Louise (Janet Margolin). Following him from his crime-obsessed youth to his law-breaking antics, the movie eventually depicts both Virgil's jail time and his prison break, with plenty of slapstick silliness throughout.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Classics/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 25m", "director": "Woody Allen", "studio": "AmericanBroadcastingCompany(ABC),JackRollinsandCharlesJoffe,PalomarPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 10, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["I have long thought Woody Allen to be one of the funniest men in the world, and now that his first film, Take the Money and Run, which he has written, directed and in which he stars, is out, the world is going to know it as well.", "Rosenblum even suggested the use of New Orleans jazz on the soundtrack, which became a staple of future Allen projects.", "A work of despairing acuity dressed up as a skittering gagfest.", "Whatever its genesis, Allen's scraggly rhetoric evolved into the dominant comic style of the 70s.", "Woody Allen's first directorial achievement is a frequently hilarious, sometimes misfiring satire of crime movies.", "This good natured, episodic spoof of gangster movies was Woody Allen's first film as a director.", "A few good laughs in an 85-minute film do not a comedy make.", "Sight gags and one-liners abound in this funny Woody Allen comedy, one of his earliest.", "", "It has plenty of hilarious jokes and concepts, like the ventriloquists' dummies at prison visiting time, and the return home from a chaingang break with five shackled cons in tow.", "", "Allen has made a movie that is, in effect, a feature-length, two-reel comedy -- something very special and eccentric and funny.", "Woody Allen's Take the Money and Run has some very funny moments, and you'll laugh a lot, but in the last analysis it isn't a very funny movie.", "", "", "", "", "Not really good, but interesting early Allen.", "", ""], "rating": ["", "3/5", "", "", "3.5/4", "C+", "", "4/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "3.5/5", "2.5/4", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Bernard Drew", "David Parkinson", "Fernando F.
