{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After unhinged Vietnam vet Bobby Thompson (Tim O'Kelly) kills his wife and mother, he goes on a brutal shooting spree. Starting at an oil refinery, he evades the police and continues his murderous outing at a drive-in movie theater, where Byron Orlock (Boris Karloff), a retiring horror film icon, is making a promotional appearance. Before long, Orlock, a symbol of fantastical old-fashioned scares, faces off against Thompson, a remorseless psychopath rooted in a harsh modern reality.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Peter Bogdanovich", "studio": "SaticoyProductions", "theater_date": "Aug 15, 1968", "dvd_date": "Jan 19, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The ingenious twist is the inclusion of Boris Karloff as an incarnation of himself", "It was one of the most powerful films of 1968 and one of the greatest directorial debuts of all time.

Unfortunately, it is a record made to be broken.", "Aware of the virtue of implied violence, Bogdanovich conveys moments of shock, terror, suspense and fear.", "Impressive directorial debut.", "A fascinatingly complex commentary on American mythology, exploring the relationship between the inner world of the imagination and the outer world of violence and paranoia, both of which were relevant to contemporary American traumas.", "Brilliant film.", "", "", "", "Targets scores an unnerving bullseye.", "Targets isn't a very good film, but it is an interesting one.", "", "", "", "", "It's difficult not to wonder how many Bobby Thompsons are out there right now, driving around with an arsenal in their trunks, ready to fire their first shots."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "", "3/4", "4/4", "8", "", "", "B+", "", "4/4", "3/5", "2/5", "3/5", "4/5", "2.5/4", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tom Meek", "Quentin Tarantino", "David Nusair", "Mike McGranaghan", "Philip Martin", "", "Variety Staff", "Dennis Schwartz", "Geoff Andrew", "Jeffrey M.
