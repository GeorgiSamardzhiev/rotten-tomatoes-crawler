When a British expedition enters the jungle, Tarzan encounters the beautiful Jane (Minnie Driver) and recognizes that, like her, he's human. Falling in love with Jane, Tarzan is torn between embracing civilization and staying with his gorilla family, which becomes threatened by the ruthless hunter Clayton (Brian Blessed).", "rating": "89", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Animation/Drama", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Chris Buck, Kevin Lima", "studio": "WaltDisneyPictures,BuenaVistaPictures", "theater_date": "Jun 18, 1999", "dvd_date": "Nov 24, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It isn't perfect but there is a lot to like in Tarzan.", "There's nothing Broadway about this Edgar Rice Burroughs adaptation, but the wow factor is still there.", "A great treatment of the original novel, and one I revisit constantly.", "Kids will be drawn to Disney's fast-paced version.", "The most legitimately touching Disney feature of the 1990s.", "The stylized physiques and movements of the characters in this exciting animated musical-romance-adventure are at once realist and fantastic.", "Just as Disney animation has become increasingly impressive, so have Disney animated films become increasingly adult.", "Highly enjoyable, great looking animated adventure that combines its touching storyline with plenty of wit and style.", "A splendid, eye-filling adventure that harkens back in many ways to the 1967 animated version of The Jungle Book.", "No classic, but very enjoyable.", "There is not one frame of this film that I would change.", "A technical marvel from Disney that shrewdly compresses and streamlines the Disney formula into a more efficient whole.", "An exciting, accomplished work that ranks with the wonderful Johnny Weissmuller movies.", "...one of Disney's most beautiful, most spectacular visual treats, even if the story line and characters are watered-down children's fare.", "Simply a smashingly well-done example of animated storytelling.", "A beautifully crafted, well-paced and well-voiced feature that will easily become yet another Disney classic.", "The first half of Tarzan is Disney's best stuff since Beauty and the Beast ...
