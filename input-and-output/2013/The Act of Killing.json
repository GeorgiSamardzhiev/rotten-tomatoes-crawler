It can't be reduced to one simple trope or theme and really can't even evoke one overriding, overarching emotion.", "The Act of Killing is important and unique in illustrating the banality of evil.", "Soaked in blood and haunted by ghosts, The Act of Killing is not an easy watch at all. But it is an incredibly rewarding one; this truly is cinema at its most important.", "One of the great, unique, often intangible and sometimes scary potentials of the film medium is the way that cinematic artifice can achieve something more profound than mere fact.", "A disturbingly comfortable voyage into the mindset of evil and the psychology of a murderer(s), Oppenheimer's film is like nothing you'll have ever seen before.", "The Act of Killing is the only 100% original work of cinema to come out this year.", "Beyond this intellectual actualisation, I can't help but think that the film falls short of its supposed brilliance. Surely watching socially or politically charged documentaries should achieve something more than cognition!", "If Oppenheimer's aim is to question and investigate what life the past has in the present, he has succeeded in a staggeringly original way.", "To take Anwar's own dramatic projection of his gradual humanisation seems a much more murky and less conclusive process than Oppenheimer wants to tidily present us with.", "It all makes sense when you submit yourself to Oppenheimer's bizarre, tragic, and eye-opening experiment.", "What makes the film so powerful, and so provocative, is that the people whose imaginations spawned these spectacular images killed hundreds of people.", "Philosophically rich, visually stunning, emotionally devastating.", "Rarely has the full potential of cinema itself been brought home so forcefully.", "The result is something we've never seen before - a new type of film - call it psycho-documentary - that's not just about mass crimes but the state of mind that produced them.", "[An] innovative piece of filmmaking so breathtakingly daring and powerful, it replaces your oxygen with awe.", "The visual highs and emotional payoffs contained within the film are well worth slogging through its slow patches."], "rating": ["1", "4.0/4", "A+", "", "A", "", "4/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "", "5/5", "2/5", "", "", "", "", "", "5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "Alison Gillmor", "Ryan Syrek", "Hanna B", "Christopher Preston", "Daniel Barnes", "Patrick Gamble", "Scott Marks", "Tara Judah", "Dave Calhoun", "PJ Nabarro", "Thrillist Entertainment Staff", "Pat Padua", "Eve Tushnet", "Steve Erickson", "Lynden Barber", "Larushka Ivan-Zadeh", "Abby Olcese"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Winnipeg Free Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Reader (Omaha, NE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dare Daniel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Diego Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Overland", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Thrillist", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">DCist", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The American Conservative", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gay City News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Limelight", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Scene-Stealers.com"], "date": ["December 3, 2020", "September 1, 2020", "July 27, 2020", "December 23, 2019", "August 27, 2019", "August 6, 2019", "June 8, 2019", "April 19, 2019", "February 26, 2019", "February 21, 2019", "January 8, 2019", "January 3, 2019", "December 16, 2018", "November 28, 2018", "August 30, 2018", "August 7, 2018", "February 21, 2018", "January 3, 2018", "September 5, 2017", "June 23, 2017"]}}
