{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After his release from prison, Jake (John Belushi) reunites with his brother, Elwood (Dan Aykroyd) -- collectively known as the \"Blues Brothers.\" Jake's first task is to save the orphanage the brothers grew up in from closing, by raising $5,000 to pay back taxes. The two are convinced they can earn the money by getting their old band back together. However, after playing several gigs and making a few enemies, including the police, the brothers face daunting odds to deliver the money on time.", "rating": "73", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy", "runtime": "2h 13m", "director": "John Landis", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "Jun 18, 1980", "dvd_date": "Jun 15, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The Blues Brothers are a popular novelty, and have a definite tongue-in-cheek appeal. But this film does nothing with the characters, except to portray them as a couple of one-sided and unlikable hoods.", "The Blues Brothers is the year's best film to date; one of the, all-time great comedies; the best movie ever made in Chicago. All are true, and, boy, is that ever a surprise.", "The Blues Brothers is unlike anything you've ever seen before, at once touching and far-far out -- and most of all, best of all, it is hugely entertaining.", "Too many times, The Blues Brothers is static when it should be ecstatic. When it tries to hit the heights, it's not nearly dizzying enough And when it should soar, it simply hangs there.", "Despite the temporary lift that the old pros give the picture, it is difficult for the non-cultist to feel anything but dismay, again, that so much has been squandered to produce so little that is truly artful or genuinely entertaining.", "As spectacular as the chases are, Blues Brothers works because of Aykroyd and Belushi, who play off each other with nearly flawless timing and sustain it throughout the movie's two hours and 10 minutes.", "The film is a monument to car wreckage, with a tip of the hat to rhythm and blues. If you've seen the preview, you've seen the movie.", "Only the music, a collection of rock and blues hits, is palatable but not enough to pull this film out of the gutter.", "With a simple narrative based around the- brothers trying to put together a band and raising money for the orphanage that moulded them with numerous complications along the way there are plenty of chances for viewers to be entertained.", "The film is a dreary waste of crude gags and misfiring stunts. But... small relief is afforded along the way by musical encounters (all too brief) with John Lee Hooker, Cab Calloway, Aretha Franklin and Ray Charles.", "But, for all those excesses. The Blues Brothers is jaunty enough often enough and joyous enough just enough to escape total disaster and to tantalize the determined.", "Landis' staging and camera blocking aren't always up to the task, but the performers are so electrifying, it doesn't much matter.", "The Blues Brothers is a joke that went too far.", "The Blues Brothers really is the sort of enterprise that makes, you wonder what the world is coming to.", "The Blues Brothers keeps our attention with its general good humor musical expertise and the myriad of comic details with which Landis fills every scene.", "Elsewhere flat characterisation and flimsy subplots -- who ever dreamed up those Nazis? -- numb the brain and add up to an expense of spirit in a waste of time, talent and money.", "Between [musical] numbers there are a number of good laughs, but most of the comedy falls flat through constant over-statement. The 20-car prang where two might do philosophy, spills through the whole film.", "The plot here is merely an excuse to slam Big Names up on the Big Screen and enact enough big crashes to give some of us a big headache.", "A loving musical tribute, a raucous comedy and an amazing demolition derby -- The Blues brothers is all these and more. Filmed in and near Chicago, the home of electric blues, it is extravagant pandemonium -- continuous and delightful.", "The script, written by Aykroyd and director John Landis, is full of opportunities for comedy, few of them realized."], "rating": ["", "4/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "4/4", "2/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["John Stark", "Gene Siskel", "Joe Baltake", "Steven Reddicliffe", "Charles Champlin", "Jack Mathews", "Patrick Taggart", "Marylynn Uricchio", "Dave Sargent", "Tom Milne", "Richard Labonte", "Jason Bailey", "Leonard Klady", "David Robinson", "Robert W.
