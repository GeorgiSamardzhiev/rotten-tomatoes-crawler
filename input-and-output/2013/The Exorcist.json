{"metadata": {"synopsis": "One of the most profitable horror movies ever made, this tale of an exorcism is based loosely on actual events. When young Regan (Linda Blair) starts acting odd -- levitating, speaking in tongues -- her worried mother (Ellen Burstyn) seeks medical help, only to hit a dead end. A local priest (Jason Miller), however, thinks the girl may be seized by the devil. The priest makes a request to perform an exorcism, and the church sends in an expert (Max von Sydow) to help with the difficult job.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Classics/Horror", "runtime": "2h 2m", "director": "William Friedkin", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,HoyaProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 24, 2014", "box_office": "$441.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Remains one of the scariest movies to date given the shocking nature of its subject matter of a little girl possessed by devil, and it's really up to the audience to believe if that can happen or not.", "The makeup is still top-notch and spectacularly chilling, paired perfectly with puppetry and repulsive props for several of the most alarming cinematic shots.", "A product of its time, in the best ways.", "Such perfectionism at the service of trash takes on a lurid, almost indecent, character. Still, Friedkin has a crass expertise with which he can keep the average moviegoer from laughing at these absurd goings-on, and he certainly gets great performances.", "Simply the most terrifying movie ever made, even now.", "The film continually struggles to suggest through atmosphere what it promises but fails to provide in substance.", "The probelm for me is that the movie has no sense of purpose, no convictions.", "One scary movie that still terrifies me to this day...", "They went above and beyond...we have movies like The Exorcist to thank for so many other movies...", "This is a powerful movie that continues to stand up today and for good reason too - it's a masterpiece.", "\"The Exorcist\".. may not be a great film. It is, however, a brilliantly successful horror movie.", "Friedkin seems to have found his forte.", "Without a doubt, \"The Exorcist\" is a touchstone in horror, seemingly incapable of taking a wrong step. Watching with the lights off is strongly encouraged. Turning them back on immediately afterwards will be a necessity.", "The Exorcist runs out of steam long before reaching its decidedly low-key (and somewhat anticlimactic) finale...", "A work of cinema in its own league.", "The Exorcist, with its excellent cast, mounting intensity, and ingeniously constructed surprises, is still a commanding achievement.", "The movie that launched a new era in horror films, and which, for one generation, remains one of the scariest experiences of their lives.", "The Exorcist, like most memorable Hollywood movies, gains its power from the way it mixes opposites: new-style realism and sexual radicalism, old-style horror and religion.", "When I first saw The Exorcist, I saw only the literal side of the story. But as I watched it again, I began to view the movie as a dark fairy tale about a parent whose child is experiencing a painful trauma.", "[Friedkin] knew he wasn't making art; he was concocting gross-out pop -- a movie so \"scary\" it borders on being silly."], "rating": ["", "9/10", "", "", "A+", "", "", "", "A", "1", "", "", "4/4", "2/4", "", "3.5/4", "3/4", "4/4", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Paul McGuire Grimes", "Mike Massie", "Simone de Rochefort", "John Simon", "Brent McKnight", "Richard Combs", "Dick Lochte", "Geoff Burns", "Chris Stuckmann", "Matt Hudson", "Kathleen Carroll", "Stanley Kauffmann", "Dustin Putman", "David Nusair", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Desmond Ryan", "Jack Mathews", "Michael Wilmington", "Jay Boyar", "Robert Wilonsky"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KSTP-TV (St. Paul, MN)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Polygon", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Esquire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sight and Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Free Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Toledo Blade", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ChrisStuckmann.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">What I Watched Tonight", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New Republic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheFrightFile.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Times"], "date": ["November 5, 2020", "August 29, 2020", "August 11, 2020", "July 25, 2020", "July 8, 2020", "March 27, 2020", "December 17, 2019", "October 26, 2018", "October 26, 2018", "October 11, 2018", "February 9, 2018", "January 8, 2018", "January 30, 2017", "November 4, 2016", "October 20, 2016", "October 15, 2014", "October 15, 2014", "October 15, 2014", "October 15, 2014", "October 15, 2014"]}}
