[Full review in Spanish]", "This masterpiece of filmmaking, written and directed by Paolo Sorrentino seems at first to be a haphazard collage of images and sounds, but it somehow all fits together perfectly.", "All things considered, you'd be hard pressed to find a more stunning, thoughtful, honest and stirring film than The Great Beauty.", "Sorrentino has finally followed up that overlooked gem (This Must Be the Place) with The Great Beauty.", "A wander through visceral vignettes of excess with a tender human heart.", "The Great Beauty is about a bored, jaded man but doesn't leave its audience bored or jaded which is itself an achievement.", "A self-conscious twenty-first century version of the Fellini classic, La Grande Bellezza is a visual feast, one of the relatively few films that takes full advantage of the extraordinary, almost hallucinatory beauty of Rome.", "The director certainly makes the most of Rome and its great beauty, making the city as much a protagonist as Jep.", "Sorrentino may well have made his masterpiece... The Great Beauty is a joyous cerebration of humankind's fleeting mortality.", "A thesis on opulence and how Rome has sated the aesthete sensibility of its main character.", "A travel by la citt\u00e0 eterna. About the beauty, the desire, the life and, finally, the death. An audiovisual travel that worth doing. [Full review in Spanish]", "It's just a life, full of strangeness and beauty, abounding with some things and lacking others.", "Ranges from acidic to surprisingly thought-provoking, disturbing, and nuanced.", "At first, The Great Beauty plays like an enjoyably exuberant satire of modern Rome. Yet slowly, grandeur starts shining through the decadence.", "I'd like to say there was a plot, only there isn't: it is simply a baroque and beautiful reflection of a five-decade romance with Rome.", "Unfortunately, it seems to expect the audience to find it a revelation that all-night partying often conceals an underlying sadness.", "... a nostalgic journey - fantastic and surreal... [Full review in Spanish]", "The Great Beauty is an alleged condemnation of the decadence of Rome and its high society, but inasmuch as it approaches coherence at all.", "Funny and sad, poignant and profound, elegant and elegiac, ambitious and ambiguous, The Great Beauty is one of the most utterly enjoyable movies I've seen in years."], "rating": ["", "8/10", "A", "A-", "", "5/5", "", "", "", "5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jordan M.
