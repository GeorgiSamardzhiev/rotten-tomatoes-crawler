{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Adrien Williams has spent time at a psychiatric hospital, learning to come to terms with a troubled past and is looking for a quiet, anonymous life as she begins to re-enter society. But she is too beautiful and self-possessed to be overlooked by the \"in crowd\" at the club -a clique of attractive, wealthy people led by Brittany Foster, their leader. Brittany takes Adrien under her wing, showing her the benefits of the privileged life and introducing her to other members of her inner circle.", "rating": "2", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Mary Lambert", "studio": "MorganCreekProductions", "theater_date": "Jul 19, 2000", "dvd_date": "Mar 26, 2019", "box_office": "$5.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Late-night cable, here it comes!", "Dark and twisted, with sexually suggestive undercurrents, this one's as safe to miss as a sunburn by the club poolside.", "The movie is billed as an erotic thriller, but it's not very erotic, nor is it really all that thrilling. It's just there, a languid, workmanlike time-waster that's the multiplex equivalent of sitting around the country club pool and working on your tan.", "Brittany is so obviously wicked, from the first glimpse we get of her, that there's nowhere for Ward to take her, except over the top.", "The acting is universally abysmal, although so are all the lines of dialogue. So I can't entirely blame the cast members.", "The press release makes a \"special request\" to not reveal the ending. They didn't need to worry. Anyone over PG-13 age is going to know exactly where this movie is going long before it gets there.", "The In Crowd's deep, dark secret? That it, too, is just a mediocre movie-of-the-week in feature-film clothing.", "Late-night Cinemax fare inexplicably granted a theatrical release.", "The In Crowd isn't a movie, it's Gorgonzola, a crumbly summertime stinker veined with pop-cultural fungus.", "A country-club member takes a club employee under her wing in this cagey formula thriller that exploits homosexuality better than murder-mystery clues.", "Stone the crows! Or is that flog the dead horse? Either way, this is cobblers.", "There's little noteworthy.", "The In Crowd isn't a movie--it's a J. Crew catalogue. Junk mail, junk movie.", "", "", "...if you're a fan of cat fights, you'll have it made in the shade.", "", "Somebody wrote this, directed this, and wrote out checks for the actors.
