{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Billionaire Sir Guy Grand (Peter Sellers) thinks nothing of throwing his endless stream of money away. He adopts a street person (Ringo Starr), christens him Youngman Grand and sets about trying to illustrate to his new heir how virtually everyone in the world can be bought. He pays a traffic cop to eat a ticket, pays the Oxford crew team to sabotage a race and finally fills a vat with feces and money, inviting one and all to keep the latter if they don't mind putting up with the former.", "rating": "59", "genre": "Classics/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Joe McGrath", "studio": "Columbia", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 9, 2019", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Vital, devastating and immensely entertaining.", "Joseph McGrath's movie version remains an acerbic, late-Sixties dark comedy classic.", "Odd yet fun comedy-fantasy starring Peter Sellers and Ringo Starr.", "", "Save for some eye-popping cameos, there's nothing very magic about this dated dog's breakfast of a movie.", "A brazen, irreverent, and wild satire that hits more often than it misses.", "A spotty, uneven satire (from the novel by Terry Southern) with a number of good yocks, but insufficient sustained wit or related action.", "The result is a variety concert of a film in which most of the acts/jokes fall flat.", "...drips with low-gloss British Mod Pop style and a would-be Richard Lester vibe, but with no clue about how to put its abundant British talent, chiefly Peter Sellers, to any worthy purpose beyond playing at adolescent cynicism.", "", "Funny, uncomfortable and without an ounce of benevolence.", "", "", "Is it all of its era?
