Bishop carries out his assignments with precision, detachment and adherence to a strict code, but when Harry (Donald Sutherland), his close friend and mentor, is murdered, Bishop vows revenge. Harry's son (Ben Foster) comes to him with vengeance in his heart and a desire to learn Bishop's trade, signaling the birth of a deadly partnership.", "rating": "53", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Simon West", "studio": "Chartoff-WinklerProductions,NuImage", "theater_date": "Jan 28, 2011", "dvd_date": "Jun 5, 2012", "box_office": "$29.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Underneath its grittier, hyper-violent, modernistic shaky-cam exterior, it's still a Jason Statham movie - for better or for worse.", "It's not so much the body count as the ways in which the bodies add up that you will remember the most.", "There is a bit of fizz between Statham and Foster that saves the copious weapon-and-whuppin' stuff from getting too generic.", "A run-of-the-mill Jason Statham action vehicle, in the best and worst ways.", "Capping the entire film is a pulsating, propelling, heart pounding score by Mark Isham. It just accelerated the excitement and energy of the already powerful storyline and action.", "It may not be a film that has any lasting impact, but it is one that satisfies audiences trying to get their action fix.", "The Mechanic gets a low score even by the abysmal standards set by Statham and the kinds of films he assembly-lines.", "If you've seen and enjoyed a Statham movie, you know what to expect.", "The Mechanic isn't precisely a classic, but Foster's performance and the ferocity of some sequences elevate it above the genre median.", "Statham belongs to the tradition of heroes, from John Wayne through Harrison Ford, who are laconic to the point of grumpiness. Yet it's not his terse toughness that makes him special. Oddly enough it's his fastidiousness...", "A brainless and easily-forgettable thriller.", "Somewhat faithful to the original, but a stupendously violent fiasco that weasels its way into being unlikable.", "[Simon West] goes for headshots, stabbings and other dispatches that are the antithesis of modern PG-13 action filmmaking.", "If you're looking for substance, character development, and an engaging storyline, you'll sadly be disappointed as this film is seriously lacking in all three of those areas.", "Statham, he of the chiseled physique and sexily receding hairline, holds his own here, doing what he has to in scenes and no more -- which is perfect for a movie like this.", "Statham has slowly become this generations' Bruce Willis, combining a quiet and sly screen persona with the ability to kick major ass when called upon", "The Mechanic will be a decent time-killer for Statham fans, but it's another black mark against the name of director Simon West.", "... a minor pleasure to see an action film that makes a virtue of lean, mean action stripped to the essence.", "A passable, but emotionally empty, action film that fails to capitalize on its interesting characters.", "Jason Statham is quickly becoming the 21st century's Bruce Willis -- I am convinced that when the apocalypse comes, the only things left surviving on the planet will be cockroaches and this Derbyshire-born bloke."], "rating": ["6/10", "2.5/4", "2.5/5", "C", "", "", "1.5/5", "", "B", "", "1.5/5", "1.5/4", "3/5", "2/4", "", "4/5", "2/5", "", "5/10", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Leigh Paatsch", "Brent McKnight", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Micheal Compton", "Shubhra Gupta", "Nathalia Aryani", "Abbie Bernstein", "John Powers", "John Hanlon", "Roger Moore", "Adam Ross", "Jeff Beck", "Leah Rozen", "Michael A.
