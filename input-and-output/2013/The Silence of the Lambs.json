{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Jodie Foster stars as Clarice Starling, a top student at the FBI's training academy. Jack Crawford (Scott Glenn) wants Clarice to interview Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), a brilliant psychiatrist who is also a violent psychopath, serving life behind bars for various acts of murder and cannibalism. Crawford believes that Lecter may have insight into a case and that Starling, as an attractive young woman, may be just the bait to draw him out.", "rating": "96", "genre": "Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "Jonathan Demme", "studio": "OrionPictures", "theater_date": "Feb 13, 1991", "dvd_date": "Aug 27, 2015", "box_office": "$130.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Although, in essence, it could be considered a police procedural work, Demme films it like an arty horror, always cloaking the action in an air of non-omniscience.", "So near perfection it practically defies criticism.", "It works as a horror movie, but also as a police procedural, a suspenseful thriller, and as a character study.", "[Foster and Hopkins's] scenes together are, to my mind, the best in a recent Hollywood film.", "This very unsettling chiller has since been elevated to classic status by virtue of the eerie chemistry few would have seen coming from the odd-couple pairing of Anthony Hopkins and Jodie Foster.", "One of the best films of the nineties, and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of cinema. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The Silence of the Lambs is supremely suspenseful, deliciously twisted and superbly acted.", "It is competent melodrama spun off from a fiendishly clever book.", "Although The Silence of the Lambs is of dubious moral value -- a triumph of technique rather than ideas -- it is not offensive. And as a pure thriller, it ranks with the classics.", "It's ultimately rather remarkable just how engrossing The Silence of the Lambs remains for the duration of its 118 minute running time...", "A film far ahead of its time. Maybe even of our time as well. It feels somehow prescient, timeless, a dark portrait of humanity's very worst coupled with the hopeful idea of what we could be.", "The creator of Something Wild establishes a similarly unpredictable context here, mixing suspense and thrills and even black humor in provocative fashion.", "It is a masterclass of acting, directing, writing and cinematography, of tonality, of pacing and of emotion.", "Harrowing, tense, and unforgettable...", "Hopkins as Lecter is chilling throughout, and he delivers one of the best final lines in movie history.", "Demme's use of close-ups is remarkable, and not something that's translated into contemporary film language too often anymore: Faces, eyes, hands; they're everywhere, making the suspense personal, and therefore way more frightening.", "Jonathan Demme's Silence of the Lambs has everything you want in a popular thriller. It's stylish, intelligent, audacious rather than shocking, and stolen by a suave monster you'll never forget.", "[Jonathan] Demme uses some surprising methods to create a thriller that is cold, baroque and brutal.
