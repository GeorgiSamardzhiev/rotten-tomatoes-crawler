Mr. Bancroft's powerful voice, in particular, registers well.", "George Bancroft, who plays the name part, has created many forceful characters on the silent screen; but those who have never heard him speak know only half his powers. His expression of the role Is commanding, magnetic.", "The slowness which has been characteristic of the majority of the \"talkies\" previously is never apparent here, for the action, once started, is fast-moving, gaining in momentum and dramatic power toward a tense and wholly logical climax.", "It's a disappointment after the fine work done by George Bancroft in other, and more virile, pictures.", "Paramount, has produced a gripping story, well directed by Rowland V.
