{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Nada (Roddy Piper), a wanderer without meaning in his life, discovers a pair of sunglasses capable of showing the world the way it truly is. As he walks the streets of Los Angeles, Nada notices that both the media and the government are comprised of subliminal messages meant to keep the population subdued, and that most of the social elite are skull-faced aliens bent on world domination. With this shocking discovery, Nada fights to free humanity from the mind-controlling aliens.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Horror/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "John Carpenter", "studio": "AliveFilms,LarryFrancoProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 5, 2016", "box_office": "$12.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Hilariously outrageous action scenes and asinine dialogue ultimately overshadow the layers of political and social commentary.", "Whereas I saw an intriguing satire on '80s materialism and conservative economic policy, Piper saw a badass action movie being made by a director at the top of his game.", "A direct and effective direction that never gives itself to unnecessary trappings, 'They Live' has not lost a bit of the freshness that it already had three decades ago.
