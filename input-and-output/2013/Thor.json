{"metadata": {"synopsis": "As the son of Odin (Anthony Hopkins), king of the Norse gods, Thor (Chris Hemsworth) will soon inherit the throne of Asgard from his aging father. However, on the day that he is to be crowned, Thor reacts with brutality when the gods' enemies, the Frost Giants, enter the palace in violation of their treaty. As punishment, Odin banishes Thor to Earth. While Loki (Tom Hiddleston), Thor's brother, plots mischief in Asgard, Thor, now stripped of his powers, faces his greatest threat.", "rating": "77", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Kenneth Branagh", "studio": "MarvelStudios", "theater_date": "May 6, 2011", "dvd_date": "Nov 23, 2015", "box_office": "$268.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Poorly characterized villains and bouts of hokey dialogue work to hinder the nobler efforts.", "Doesn't come close to achieving its true potential.", "There were too many inconsistencies to simply ignore, too many questions that are left unanswered to make this a truly enjoyable experience.", "Marvel's reluctance to entertain the notion of confronting military conquest works to its narrative detriment. The heroes aren't allowed to truly change, because they're never made to face the parts of themselves most connected to the world around them.", "Thor changed everything. Thor gave us a universe.", "A surprisingly adept mixture of comic book goofiness and epic mythos, filled with bright colors and beautiful production design.", "Thor introduces an entirely new realm of mythology to the Marvel Cinematic Universe by way of the wondrous beauty that is Asgard.", "Director Kenneth Branagh and the screenwriting team of Ashley Edward Miller & Zack Stentz and Don Payne...have come up with a movie that's surprisingly winsome and enjoyable.", "Thor deserves a thunderous applause.", "[H]umanity is what Thor has in spades.", "The self-serious aspects established here are turned on their head down the line, but in establishing the lovable, naive Asgardian power-hitter, it makes an effective debut.", "Thor's not entirely worthless, though. There are a few good things about it. For example, it's so loud that if you happen to be preoccupied by something bad in your life, you can't think about it while you're in the theater.", "If Thor isn't necessarily a home run, it's an extremely solid base hit, effectively extending the goal posts of what to expect in this universe without ever shattering our suspension of disbelief", "It's almost infuriating when 'Team Thor vs. Team Loki\" has little of the fervor that made \"Team Edward vs. Team Jacob\" a phenomenon.", "This is wink-and-nod fantasy with no overtures to anything more significant.", "First is worst in Thor appearances, but since he gets better every time this one's valuable as a part of the whole. Also, just say NO to Dutch Angles & bleached facial hair.", "Chris Hemsworth makes an imposing, good-humoured Thor... but the motor of the film is Tom Hiddleston's complex, conflicted Loki.", "This, my friends, is what a summer movie should be: exciting, clever, comedic, and a joyride.", "Witty, charming and very current, the big screen adaptation of Thor is sure to catapult its star Chris Hemsworth (whose wife, Elsa Pataky, ironically stars in Fast Five) to leading man status.", "Thor...as in bore?
