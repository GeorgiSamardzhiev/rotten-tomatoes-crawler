Unfortunately, the uncontrollable kids do not play nice, so Woody and the gang make plans for a great escape.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Animation/Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Lee Unkrich", "studio": "PixarAnimationStudios,WaltDisneyAnimation", "theater_date": "Jun 18, 2010", "dvd_date": "Nov 23, 2015", "box_office": "$415.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Nothing short of brilliant.", "Yet another masterful creation by Pixar Animation Studios.", "Not in the same league as Pixar's previous efforts ... it still solidifies the notion that this production company is at the forefront of modern animation.", "Toy Story 3 is not only one of Pixar's best films, but perhaps the best of the Toy Story trilogy.", "...an inventive and often completely gripping adventure...", "While threepeats may be rare in the sports world, they're even harder to achieve in the cinematic realm. Yet here's Toy Story 3, bucking the odds and satisfying sky-high expectations.", "Something deeply, almost primal in a powerful way, tapping into the emotional core of an entire generation and the eternally young at heart.", "More than lives up to the lofty expectations as a worthy addition to the already classic series. There is something for everyone in the film, which is easily the best major American studio release I've seen in 2010.", "Toy Story 3 has magic in spades.", "Dear Pixar, THANK YOU for not churning out yet another inferior straight-to-DVD animated sequel, and instead taking the time to create something that will be as dear to Toy Story fans at the first time we saw Woody & Buzz on screen.", "From moments of pure delight to one of the most heartbreaking goodbyes in recent movie memory, the trilogy wraps up in a masterful way and once again proves Pixar is on a level all its own.", "Leave it to Pixar to subvert the Hollywood rule of sequels, which states that each subsequent film must have eyes full of dollar signs at the expense of quality.", "With a heart felt ending and truly outstanding story, Toy Story 3 has ensured that the franchise and all the characters we have known and loved, will be remembered for infinity, and beyond.", "What's so distressing about all this, as I keep pointing out, is the tremendous talent of the Pixar team getting wasted on nostalgic goop, forever presenting idealized 1950s suburban culture as the norm.", "Moments of uproarious humor and emotional farewells offset the darkness and send Woody and his pals on a memorable ride off into the sunset.", "Like last year's Up from the same company, Pixar, this film tickles the funny bone but also brings a tear to the eye.", "Hilarity, terrors, the melancholy of love and loss and growing up, and millions of adult-baby tears ensue.", "It's not the usual Hollywood conveyor-belt product. Made with love and intelligence, this adventure has enough thrills, laughs and emotion to satisfy any adult or child.", "A reasonable amount of fun ensues.", "Toy Story 3 isn't in the same league as its predecessors, but it's close enough that most people won't care."], "rating": ["1", "3.5/4", "", "", "4/4", "4/4", "3.5/4", "A", "A+", "", "A-", "", "5/5", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "5/5", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "David Harris", "David Nusair", "Matt Brunson", "Matthew Lucas", "Micheal Compton", "Rachel Wagner", "Amie Simon", "Kiko Martinez", "Tara Thorne", "Christopher Suter", "Eileen Jones", "Brandy McDonnell", "Rebecca Cusey", "Lindy West", "Christopher Tookey", "Daniel Barnes", "Edward Johnson-Ott"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Frenzy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Three Imaginary Girls", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Antonio Current", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Coast (Halifax, Nova Scotia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The eXile", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Oklahoman", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WORLD", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Stranger (Seattle, WA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Mail (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sacramento News &amp; Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">NUVO Newsweekly"], "date": ["November 30, 2020", "September 26, 2020", "August 14, 2020", "October 24, 2019", "July 6, 2019", "June 20, 2019", "June 7, 2019", "May 9, 2019", "April 22, 2019", "March 8, 2019", "December 31, 2018", "November 17, 2018", "November 5, 2018", "October 31, 2018", "August 8, 2018", "March 22, 2018", "January 11, 2018", "January 4, 2018", "June 29, 2015", "June 29, 2015"]}}
