{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Architect Mark Wallace (Albert Finney) and his wife, Joanna (Audrey Hepburn), travel to France to meet with an affluent client (Claude Dauphin). While there, they reflect on their first decade of marriage -- memories of when they first met, of courtship and of road trips through the French countryside. As flirtation and playful quarreling turn to boredom with the banality of married life, the Wallaces struggle to rekindle their passion, while mutual infidelity threatens to tear them apart.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 52m", "director": "Stanley Donen", "studio": "TwentiethCenturyFox", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Despite the intermittent tragedies, the ending is powerfully heartfelt, smartly repeating an artistic motif that ties up the whole mixed-up storyline.", "Would be a far better film if it could only decide which of three lanes it wanted to drive in - comedy, farce or philosophical comment.", "The influence is clearly Nouveau Vague - specifically, it apes A Man and A Woman and even the theme music by Mancini resembles the haunting score of that French movie. No matter. Two for the Road rings true.", "Imagine if Richard Linklater's three Before films were all rolled into one movie...", "A Hollywood-style romance between beautiful people, and an honest story about recognizable human beings.", "It's more facile than poignant.", "Hepburn, shedding her established persona with glee, is particularly great, while Frederic Raphael's acerbic screenplay has touches of material he'd explore decades later with Eyes Wide Shut.", "With Two for the Road... Donen took a romantic comedy and deconstructed it, using the nonlinear structure and jump cuts that were being popularised at the time by the French new wave.", "The picture never quite finds its tone.", "", "A benchmark of marital dischord with luminous Hepburn, cheeky Finney", "", "The jagged editing left many audiences stranded, but credit Donen for at least trying to put some gas in the worn-out conventions of 1960s mainstream filmmaking.", "Despite its visual trickery, it's one of the most emotionally honest films ever made in America.", "", "", "", "", "One of the best movies about relationships ever.
