Visiting an art gallery, they meet seductive painter Juan Antonio (Javier Bardem), who invites them for a weekend of food, art and sex. Sparks really ignite when his fiery former lover (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz) arrives on the scene, making for a very crowded house.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "Woody Allen", "studio": "MediaproPictures", "theater_date": "Aug 15, 2008", "dvd_date": "Jan 21, 2017", "box_office": "$23.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The worst aspect of Vicky Cristina Barcelona is its attitude toward art and creativity, which is entirely superficial.", "The Spanish sun has clearly rejuvenated Woody Allen's career. After making three films in London with diminishing returns... he's noticeably benefited from a good dose of Vitamin D: Vicky Cristina Barcelona is his most entertaining movie in years.", "This is Allen's most laid-back movie in memory, but the relaxed, carefree vibe does not blunt the edge of the humour. The city of Barcelona is a delight to gaze at throughout too.", "Vicky Cristina Barcelona is a colourful, passionate romantic comedy that - hopefully - marks a return to form for one of the industry's most iconic talents.", "Truly a ride of pure enjoyment to watch...", "Perhaps the biggest surprise, though, is Miss Cruz. She has always been a more than serviceable actress, but here she really shines.", "Missing from Vicky Cristina Barcelona are the keenly complex touches that elevated [Woody Allen's] earlier statements on caprice. Then again, that's been gone from his movies for years, and there's vain hope in thinking that Iberia would inspire it again.", "This is a slight film, a minor Allen film, a bit of a footnote, but it's warm and engaging and isn't Matchpoint, Scoop or Cassandra's Dream, which has to be a mercy.", "This is one of Woody's throw-away movies. It's as if he has a compulsion to make them, just as he has to haul his ass down to Michael's Pub in Manhattan every Monday and play clarinet.", "Penelope's performance is a little sterotypoical, but fantastic...", ". . .while Vicky Cristina Barcelona isn't entirely a return to form, it is interesting enough to stick in one's brain.", "Vicky Cristina Barcelona is everything it tries, halfheartedly, to criticize about the character of Vicky: It's determined to be ordinary and likeable no matter what the emotional cost.", "What you see is less reflective of old glories and more indicative of a new composure that inflicts a lot of Allen's newest endeavors, in which characters are seen engaging in discussions that test the limits of their deadening comforts.", "Unlike the vast majority of summertime comedies, the delights of Vicky Cristina Barcelona won't evaporate any time soon.", "I couldn't imagine better company than Vicky, Cristina and Woody on a relaxing summer day.", "Allen seems uninterested in pushing his material beyond impersonally generic, or even in thinking things through.", "It's a shift in tone for Allen; it's still a movie about sex and those who seek it, but it's hung on a sun-blushed, wine-sploshed Spanish love triangle that's more appealing and more amorous than anything the director has produced in decades.", "", "", "Although Penelope Cruz's performance is amusing, the film feels a bit forced, looking for meaning in Spain where there may not be any."], "rating": ["", "", "3.5/5", "4/5", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "B+", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "", "4/5", "4/5", "B-", "2/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Jason Best", "Leigh Paatsch", "Nikki Baughan", "Remezcla Team", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Stephen Garrett", "Deborah Ross", "Brian D.
