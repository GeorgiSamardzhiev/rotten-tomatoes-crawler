Yet, for all that, it still doesn't have the charm of the brief original.", "The advantage of adapting Maurice Sendak's slim tome is that there is plenty of scope for interpretation; however, for the first time in his career, Jonze comes up short in the imagination department.", "Jonze isn't always successful in his sometimes-esoteric interpretation of the book. But his attempt shows that he has sensitivity to the smaller dramas of the human experience.", "It's a quiet reminder of the power of scary-ish stories, and it's made with warmth, humor, and wisdom.", "It is bewildering but not in an emotionally complex or troublesome way. It's bewildering in a narratively confused, narratively lost, we-never-figured-out-what-we-wanted-all-this-extra-stuff-to-add-up-to sort of way.", "Fortunately, we have artists like Maurice Sendak, who remain unabashedly young at heart and wondrously capable of connecting with the child inside us all.", "The minus I give this children's story pains me...If I had seen this film when I was eight, I would have been terrified.", "Spike Jonze's film adaptation of Sendak's beloved 1963 picture book, Where the Wild Things Are, evokes that state of being, of creative and destructive feelings undiluted and sometimes unchecked.", "It's gorgeous but slow in parts.", "Unnecessarily gloomy and emotionally convoluted, Spike Jonze and Dave Eggers' script for Where the Wild Things Are is a melancholy adaptation of the one-two punch that is the heavily illustrated, scantly written book by Maurice Sendak.", "Does leave a lingering impression--but more due to the nagging feeling that it never quite connects than to Jonze actually meeting his grandiose thematic ambitions.", "Spike Jonze adapted a book with less than 200 words into a 90-minute feature and it's simply wonderful.", "What Spike Jonze is doing is trying something completely new, messing with the idea of what exactly a movie is, what a narrator is, what a filmmaker is, really, and doing it with a beloved franchise and a $80 million budget."], "rating": ["6/10", "3.5/4", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "A+", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "B+", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "A-"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "David Harris", "Matthew Lucas", "Micheal Compton", "Rachel Wagner", "Amie Simon", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Kaleem Aftab", "Megan Basham", "Alissa Wilkinson", "Deborah Ross", "Emily Sears", "Ed Koch", "Melissa Starker", "Jenni Miller", "Sarah Silver", "Michael Dequina", "Chase Whale", "Will Leitch"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Three Imaginary Girls", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The National (UAE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WORLD", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Vox", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Birth.Movies.Death.", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Atlantic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Columbus Alive", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bust Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Stop Smiling", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieReport.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gordon and the Whale", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Deadspin"], "date": ["November 29, 2020", "September 27, 2020", "October 11, 2019", "June 6, 2019", "May 11, 2019", "May 4, 2019", "March 9, 2019", "December 1, 2018", "November 1, 2018", "October 8, 2018", "September 25, 2018", "August 30, 2018", "June 26, 2018", "January 17, 2018", "August 23, 2017", "October 5, 2016", "March 5, 2014", "January 27, 2014", "August 28, 2013", "June 22, 2013"]}}
