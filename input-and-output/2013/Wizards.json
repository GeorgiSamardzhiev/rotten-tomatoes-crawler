{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After the death of his mother, the evil mutant wizard Blackwolf (Steve Gravers) discovers some long-lost military technologies. Full of ego and ambition, Blackwolf claims his mother's throne, assembles an army and sets out to brainwash and conquer Earth. Meanwhile, Blackwolf's gentle twin brother, the bearded and sage Avatar (Bob Holt), calls upon his own magical abilities to foil Blackwolf's plans for world domination -- even if it means destroying his own flesh and blood.", "rating": "59", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Animation/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 20m", "director": "Ralph Bakshi", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 20, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["What is at least galavanising and shocking in the context of Bakshi's earlier films seems more like an out-of-control tic here.", "There are moments of beauty, but it's a far cry from Fantasia.", "If Wizards is a failure, then it's a fascinating failure.", "Bakshi is direct in his imagery and his messaging: the drumbeat of war and the rush of new technology is killing us...Wizards is far more than a simple animated curiosity, but a surprisingly dark, dangerous, and compelling piece of fantasy.", "Bakshi's filmmaking is sloppy and slapdash at times, to be sure, but it is also uncompromising.", "The story is kind of a mess, but Wizards goes beyond your standard sword and sorcery tale into some heavy surrealism.", "a unique film unlike anything else you'll see from this era", "Story and characters leave much to be desired, but there's something wonderful about this refreshingly gritty, innovative animated feature.", "Its status as a low-budget cult film seems secure. I just don't think it's as good a film as it might have been with more restrained storytelling or art design.", "Wizards is meant to be vast, but its smallest moments tend to be the most memorable.", "If some elements do date the film, there nevertheless is an artisan's touch to Bakshi's images that warrant his inclusion in any discussion of cinema's great visionaries.", "while having so little money may, paradoxically, have liberated Bakshi from studio interference, this freedom allows him to indulge in ideas that are, metaphorically and otherwise, away with the fairies.", "An effective mix of animation, stock footage, and rear projection.", "Ralph Bakshi's animated sword-and-sorcery tale is a long way from his best work, marred by cut-rate techniques and a shapeless screenplay.", "Moderate fun here and there.", "", "Mr. Bakshi's allegory is fairly obvious from the outset, but he and his animators are convincingly professional.
