{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Growing up on an apple farm in Tasmania, youthful Albert Einstein (Yahoo Serious) makes various scientific discoveries and winds up in plenty of unusual circumstances, even rescuing kittens from being cooked in a pie. The goofy, shock-haired Albert also develops the theory of relativity and subsequently promotes his revelation in Sydney, where he falls for the lovely Marie Curie (Odile Le Clezio) and somehow manages to invent rock 'n' roll along the way.", "rating": "36", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 29m", "director": "Yahoo Serious", "studio": "WarnerBros.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2008", "box_office": "$8.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Pleasingly cartoonish as physical comedy.", "Serious's most distinguishing feature is his unruly hair, which serves as both a reminder of Einstein's own unkempt mane and the endless series of '80s-era stand-up comedians memorable only for their wacky hairdos.", "The movie runs out of -- excuse me again -- energy in the late going, and the invention of the humor is uneven. But Serious plays the title role with charm and lightness. His wild red hair makes Don King's look like a crewcut.", "Young Einstein is good-natured and harmless, but it's not very funny.", "Considering the pre-opening buildup this film has had, it could turn out to be a bigger bomb than the one Einstein's theory anticipated.", "The next Serious movie could well be something special.", "It has the charm and advantage of a genuine visual style of its own, both laconic and witty, as well as a likably dopey plot and cast of characters.", "A rather lame, awkward and amateurish movie, only fitfully funny and made in such a remorselessly low-brow way that it makes Crocodile Dundee look like Citizen Kane.", "Not all the gags work -- the cat pie-related ones, for instance -- but the whole is clearly the product of an inimitable and engaging talent.", "Serious himself is a pleasantly cartoonish screen presence, but he conveys an underlying, offhand intelligence that hints at an acute familiarity with his subject.", "Einstein has a handsome period look, even when director of photography Jeff Darling is shooting the musical montages that periodically break up the action.", "A five-minute idea stretched bloodily over 90 minutes of dead air.", "Serious, a long-haired gangly clown, exhibits a brash and confident sense of humor, endearing personality, and a fondness for sight gags.", "The episodic structure and slapstick humour keep the pace superficially bubbling along, but given a flimsy intellectual base, form and content are at odds with one another.", "", "I couldn't even make it through this movie! Did anyone?", "An animated, and clever cocktail of laughs and rock and roll", "Pee-Yew!
