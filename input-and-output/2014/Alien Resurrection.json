Cheer on the dumb humans, boo the even dumber aliens.", "The team chose to raise the franchise from the ashes, but instead of a golden phoenix they produced a jaundiced turkey.", "Jeunet,... has both a pictorial imagination and a healthy sense of irony, qualities that may not have viewers on the edge of their seats but do tend to make \"Resurrectoin\" quirky fun.", "Alien Resurrection is juiced by the fresh thinking of visionary French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet...", "It's tense, mordantly funny, very graphic and bloody, while Weaver is on great form as the clone with some interesting alien influences on her personality.", "It's at least more watchable than Alien3 in that it knows it's a bit crap but has a blast with it anyway! I have to admire that, even if it still won't score that highly...", "Without anything to pull the project in a single direction, it fumbles and flails, punctuated by some interesting visuals and action beats, but content to coast on the calm seas of been-there, done-that.", "The franchise has lost none of its taste for acid-spewing, flesh-impaling, entrail-dripping gore. But the tone has changed...If this is your cup of slime, this jauntily gruesome installment won't disappoint.", "Weaver obviously knows her role by now, but Winona Ryder is as much of an action hero as Julie Nixon would be, going way out of her element.", "If you prefer the action of Aliens, then Alien: Resurrection has the next best action of the franchise. If you prefer the horror of Alien, Alien: Resurrection is the second scariest one.", "This is not a Hollywood space thriller at all, but an intergalactic fantasy driven by the same cheerfully eccentric impulses that have informed a myriad of high-spirited French filmmakers.", "A blend of surrealist humor, unintentional self-parody and groan-inducing moments, this is easily the nadir of the franchise.", "[Jeuenet] doesn't push it all the way to \"so bad it's good\" territory, but he at least gives a healthy dose of the bizarre that makes it memorable, in its fashion.", "This fourth chapter in the popular sci-fi-horror franchise is without a doubt the weakest, both dramatically and visually.", "More than worthwhile as a closing statement.", "", "Simply put, Jean-Pierre Jeunet was the absolute wrong choice for this film. His award-winning quirky French visual sensibilities don't mesh well with Joss Whedon's meat-and-potatoes script.", "Grotesque carnage, vile characters; steer clear.", "This fourth chapter comes off as the first fully postmodern Alien film: not Alien multiplied or cubed, but synthetically reawakened, groggy enough to sleepwalk through our memories of the first three, as in a dream."], "rating": ["3/10", "2.5/5", "1/5", "", "", "4/5", "3/5", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "3/4", "2/4", "4/10", "C", "", "B+", "6/10", "2/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Leigh Paatsch", "Jim Ross", "David Baron", "Peter Travers", "Alan Jones", "David Hogan", "Zaki Hasan", "David Ansen", "Mike Clark", "Fred Topel", "David Keyes", "Wesley Lovell", "Tim Brayton", "Emanuel Levy", "Michael Nordine", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "R.L.
