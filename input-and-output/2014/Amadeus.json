{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) is a remarkably talented young Viennese composer who unwittingly finds a fierce rival in the disciplined and determined Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham). Resenting Mozart for both his hedonistic lifestyle and his undeniable talent, the highly religious Salieri is gradually consumed by his jealousy and becomes obsessed with Mozart's downfall, leading to a devious scheme that has dire consequences for both men.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "2h 38m", "director": "Milos Forman", "studio": "AMLF", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 18, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Amadeus is not only one of the best films made about professional jealousy and classical music, it's also - rather uniquely - a young person's movie.", "...a case study for the theological notion of common grace.", "From the first few seconds of the film, it's evident that the music will guide it to cinematic perfection.", "Amadeus is a film of high accolade...this film is grand on every level and I'm glad to have experienced it.", "The film's awesome achievements will remind audiences how rich and challenging a cinematic experience can be.", "Tom HuIce's brattish Mozart builds in strength and sensitivity as the film proceeds; F. Murray Abraham's Salieri impresses immediately.", "Amadeus isn't meant to be a biography of the composer's life, but a bawdy, black fantasy, a fiction based on a few curious facts. Peter Shaffer adapted the screenplay from his own stage play: What was intimate is now opulent.", "A substantial achievement -- and graced by an uncommonly distinguished score.", "What starts as an absorbing study of historical characters and situations ends as just another elaborate and over-long Hollywood style costume-piece.", "Amadeus (1984) was director Milos Forman's stunning, opulent fictional biography of musical prodigy Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, based on the Tony-winning Broadway play...", "Amadeus is a movie masterpiece: engaging, beautifully performed and staged, and packed with emotional power.", "Both Shaffer and Forman sidestep traps of being too obvious or of oversimplifying. Consequently, both Mozart and Salieri emerge as complex figures, full of contrasting impulses.", "The unkindest cuts of all are inflicted on the music. It bleeds at every splice, welling up, fading out, left suspended in mid-phrase.", "The skill of Amadeus is in making you sympathize with Salieri, as slimy and despicable as he is, because of his flaws. He appeals to your sense of democracy, even though you know that talent -- certainly genius -- isn't parceled out democratically.", "I enjoyed the film despite all my objects about the representation of Mozart. [Full Review in Spanish]", "One of the best American films of the 1980s.", "[Forman's] is a genuine adaptation, not only because the play is permitted to stretch its legs beyond the pop-up book confines of a proscenium arch, but because he has leavened its High Art pretensions with a dash of showbiz raciness.", "Sheer craftsmanship is the film's key strength.", "The look of the film is absolutely gorgeous.", "Except for the Mozart music and Tharp movements around the edges, Amadeus plays like a monument to mediocrity."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "1", "", "", "", "", "", "", "A+", "1", "", "", "", "", "1", "", "", "4/4", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Andrew Parker", "Josh Larsen", "Mike Massie", "Ed Travis", "Mark Czarnecki", "Geoff Brown", "Rita Kempley", "Tim Pulleine", "Patrick Gibbs", "Tim Dirks", "Grant Watson", "Rick Chatenever", "Robert Craft", "Bruce McCabe", "Gabriel Jackson", "Tim Brayton", "Gilbert Adair", "Trevor Johnston", "Scott Nash", "Michael Sragow"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Gate", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Jesus", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Maclean&#39;s Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmsite", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fiction Machine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Santa Cruz Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New York Review of Books", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Globe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sight and Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Three Movie Buffs", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun"], "date": ["November 19, 2020", "October 8, 2020", "August 31, 2020", "April 10, 2020", "January 23, 2020", "January 22, 2020", "January 22, 2020", "January 22, 2020", "January 22, 2020", "September 27, 2019", "May 12, 2019", "February 20, 2019", "June 18, 2018", "April 26, 2018", "March 1, 2018", "March 12, 2015", "March 3, 2015", "March 3, 2015", "March 3, 2015", "February 4, 2014"]}}
