After his boss dies, Frank uses his own ingenuity and strict business code to become one of the inner city's most powerful crime bosses.

[Full review in Spanish]", "Something akin to a time warp, stepping back into a time of higher filmmaking integrity and more personal visions.", "Though it's certainly admirable to aim high, it's like Frank Lucas himself says: \"Either you're somebody, or you ain't nobody.\" Unfortunately for American Gangster, it ends up somewhere between the two.", "It's 157 minutes long, but immerses its audience with its twists and intricacies as it plays out and considers the logistics and consequences of crime and police corruption, with a plethora of show-stealing performances from the cast.", "American Gangster is an epic, true crime drama, that although not entirely original in its premise is excellent in its execution.", "Flattened by Scott's cardboard evocation of New York in the '70s, Zaillian's shallow criticism of corrupting power, and weirdly bloodless performances", "File this one under \"American Oscar Wanna-Be.\"", "When American Gangster was announced, with actors Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe and directed by Ridley Scott, it seemed like a can't miss project. It missed.", "", "Ridley Scott's gangster flick aims high and mostly measures up.", "Washington may have not wanted to glorify the Harlem drug dealer, but with his superb acting skills he has created one of the coolest gangsters since Tony Montana.", "Telling a true story doesn't excuse a filmmaker from making his movie stand out from the many others that have traversed similar ground.", "It feels familiar, even Washington's performance of real-life Frank Lucas feels like something we've seen before.", "It isn't that American Gangster is an empirically bad film or is even unenjoyable. But don't be surprised if, when you walk out of the theater, you forget the film ever existed.", "Inflated talk of American Gangster as a modern masterpiece--or even an Oscar-worthy picture--ignores the fact that there's not a single memorable setpiece in the film.", "Best of all, there are top-flight performances from both Denzel Washington and Russell Crowe who create interesting, rounded characters out of potential clich\u00e9s.", "Scott's not interested in fireworks but small implosions of the soul and ego."], "rating": ["1", "3.0/4", "B+", "3/5", "3.5/4", "3/5", "4/5", "4/5", "", "2/4", "2.5/5", "D+", "", "4/5", "2/5", "7/10", "6/10", "2.5/4", "4/5", "B"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Micheal Compton", "Nando Salv\u00e1", "Matthew Lucas", "Ali Gray", "Alex Fletcher", "Matthew Pejkovic", "Fernando F.
