{"metadata": {"synopsis": "David (David Naughton) and Jack (Griffin Dunne), two American college students, are backpacking through Britain when a large wolf attacks them. David survives with a bite, but Jack is brutally killed. As David heals in the hospital, he's plagued by violent nightmares of his mutilated friend, who warns David that he is becoming a werewolf. When David discovers the horrible truth, he contemplates committing suicide before the next full moon causes him to transform from man to murderous beast.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Comedy/Horror/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "John Landis", "studio": "PolyGramFilmedEntertainment,Guber-PetersCompany", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 13, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...an entirely erratic yet ultimately satisfying endeavor...", "The prosthetics and animatronics of the initial transformation sequence are the unforgettable (and Oscar-winning) highlight of the picture.", "David's writhing discomfort in his own skin marks not just the monstrous metamorphosis in and of genre, but also that deep sense of estrangement experienced by any well-meaning if gauche tourist tripping up on local lore and mores.", "While it doesn't bore or anger the public, it is one of those films that's forgotten as soon as it's over. [Full Review in Spanish]", "It feels increasingly like a symbol of traveler abroad alienation-what trying to live in a place that isn't home can feel like: confusing, rageful, even physically debilitating.", "Aside from the special effects, this film is a fun time at the movies, but not as memorable as other horror classics.", "I suspect Landis hoped to keep moviegoers eerily disarmed with an unpredictable mixture of wacky and terrifying touches. Unfortunately, his own touch... is so slack and uncertain that the movie ends up dramatically shapeless.", "John Landis teaches us two things in An American Werewolf in London (1981): turning into a werewolf is a very painful process, and the dead are boring!", "A film that, despite 35 years of evolution in special effects, do not surpass the carnal naturalness of this one.

He would have been better off dispensing with the comedy altogether.", "Scary-funny is an acquired taste. For me, it tends to be a recipe in which you can't taste either of the constituent ingredients. The big man-to-wolf transformation scene is still a marvel.", "The metamorphoses into the werewolf scenes are spectacular and the beast's rampage through Piccadilly Circus is marvellous. Splendid gory fun.", "Still scary, violent and very, very funny.", "Some of the special effects are a little creaky now, but the snap of Landis's editing and the razor's-edge balance of horror and comedy are still fresh.", "An American Werewolf in London, like a fine wine, just keeps getting more and more vintage."], "rating": ["3/4", "8/10", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Nusair", "Mike Massie", "Anton Bitel", "Diego Gal\u00e1n", "Sean Fennessey", "Chauncey K.
