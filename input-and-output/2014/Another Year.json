{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Tom (Jim Broadbent) and Gerri (Ruth Sheen) are an older couple who have been happily married for a long time, making them an anomaly among their friends and family members. Gerri's friend Mary (Lesley Manville) is a single woman whose husband left her and who disguises her loneliness. Gerri tries to fix her up with another friend, Ken (Peter Wight), but is taken aback when Mary is more interested in the couple's adult son, Joe (Oliver Maltman), a lawyer who is considerably younger than she is.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 9m", "director": "Mike Leigh", "studio": "ThinManFilms,SimonChanningWilliams", "theater_date": "Dec 29, 2010", "dvd_date": "Jan 14, 2014", "box_office": "$3.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There is little doubt that Another Year will be a film that will stay with you long after the closing credits.", "Another Year is a life-affirming portrait of a harmonious marriage and the emotional salve it offers in a cruel world.", "Another Year, though not an important piece of Leigh's oeuvre, is still a highly enjoyable one.", "Another year, another 100 things to celebrate and mourn-and another film that makes me appreciate how good cinema can make me feel.", "Although caring, cheerful and kind individuals feature prominently, with much to laugh about, Another Year is really about the emotionally bruised amongst us, about regret, about envy, and the fact that life is often cruel.", "With its slow movement and at times painful portrayal of human wretchedness, it would be hard to imagine a less fun time at the movies than Another Year, but it would also be hard to imagine a more worthwhile one.", "It is beautifully played, free of the usual tics and twitches and palsies that so often afflict Leigh characters, and Manville, in particular, gives everything she has, which turns out to be an awesome amount.", "This turnaround isn't enough to completely salvage it, but it turns it from Leigh's worst film into an interesting, honorable failure.", "There is something radical in the way Leigh creates such an intimate, closely observed portrait of a marriage and then essentially takes it for granted, looking elsewhere for the drama to propel the narrative.", "This movie is really about a departure.", "Mike Leigh doesn't do thrill rides or happily ever afters, and this character-driven drama marks no new territory for the director. But it may just be his best film yet.", "This movie makes me want to avoid my married friends.", "Another Year is an extremely accessible and gripping film with beautifully observed character moments and outstanding performances by a superb cast, especially Leslie Manville who shines as Mary.", "It's not the most focused Leigh movie, but plot has never been his strong suit.", "Leigh sculpts Another Year in time like Edgar Degas painted a picture.", "", "Mike Leigh is often dumped in the dour, 'kitchen sink' genre of British filmmaking, but that is to overlook his wily sense of humor.", "Leigh creates a fascinating diorama in which life-long and contented couple Tom and Gerri sit in sympathy and in judgement on the lonely friends that orbit them.", "[Observes] the thin lines and acute angles which separate well-adjusted people on a continuing path of contentment from the less fortunate ones who live lives of regret and desperation.", "The Hepples are a joy to watch. ...
