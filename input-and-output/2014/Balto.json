{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this animated feature, a deadly diphtheria epidemic strikes the remote town of Nome, Alaska. With the life-saving medicine located hundreds of miles away, the residents decide to send out a sled-dog team. Balto (Kevin Bacon) -- a half-wolf dog ignored by all except a goose, Boris (Bob Hoskins), and two polar bears -- is chosen to run but is disqualified by lead dog Steele (Jim Cummings). When the other dogs get lost in the snow, Balto risks his life to rescue them and deliver the medicine.", "rating": "54", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Animation/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 17m", "director": "Simon Wells", "studio": "UniversalPictures,AmblinEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 10, 2014", "box_office": "$11.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["'Balto' is touching, even if in very specific moments -, it is so much because of the honesty in those moments in which the drama is not covered by any extra layer.
