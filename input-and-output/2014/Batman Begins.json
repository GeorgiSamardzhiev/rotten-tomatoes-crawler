{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A young Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) travels to the Far East, where he's trained in the martial arts by Henri Ducard (Liam Neeson), a member of the mysterious League of Shadows. When Ducard reveals the League's true purpose -- the complete destruction of Gotham City -- Wayne returns to Gotham intent on cleaning up the city without resorting to murder. With the help of Alfred (Michael Caine), his loyal butler, and Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman), a tech expert at Wayne Enterprises, Batman is born.", "rating": "84", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 20m", "director": "Christopher Nolan", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,DiBonaventuraPictures", "theater_date": "Jun 15, 2005", "dvd_date": "Sep 9, 2009", "box_office": "$206.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Admirable in its emphasis on character over gadgetry, and is ambitious for a summer blockbuster, but for me, unfortunately it never quite takes flight.", "All in all, it definitely changes the course - for the better - of this formerly failing franchise.", "Batman is shackled by one of the most potent recurring themes in Nolan's work: a fear of the past, in all its pain, guilt and trauma - a fear that the forward march of time may not be enough to heal.", "Batman Begins is an utterly conventional, conformist work, respectful of order and wealth, unable or unwilling to challenge any of contemporary society's taboos. Worse than that, its grim pomposity and self-seriousness invite only laughter.", "Batman Begins is certainly a worthy staging post in the inescapably compelling career of Christopher Nolan, and stands the test of time some 15 years after its release.", "Batman Begins is easily one of the best films featuring the iconic DC Comics superhero, but far from perfect, despite telling what may just end up being the definitive big screen origin story for the Dark Knight.", "Bale provides the series with the best Batman thus far, with a dark and conflicted performance that easily matches Nolan's tone.", "With a phenomenal cast, technical work that is beyond reproach and attention to detail that is generally only seen in works by Spielberg or Lucas, Batman Begins is a perfect way to begin the summer movie season.", "The Batman origin story that we've been waiting for!", "The film looks great and there some striking set-pieces, but in spite of a series of comic quips -- the new film lacks a sense of adventure and fun. Nevertheless, Nolan, Goyer and Bale have still managed to revitalize the ailing franchise.", "I like that it embraces comic book sensibilities a little bit more than other Nolan films. Definitely a bit too long but a good origin story", "Batman has been all about darkness, Nolan just makes it a shade darker. Go see it.", "That the movie ends up thematising the murk of our modern world, if not exactly piecing it together into a comprehensible whole, is perhaps as much as we can expect.", "Nolan has created a Batman epic that races so far ahead of its predecessors that they simply cease to exist.", "Batman Begins isn't a terrible film, it simply isn't that good. Overly long, vaguely goofy in places, and straining for gravity and dignity, it's the dignity part that is hard.", "... Nolan gets the character right: Bruce Wayne is the secret identity and Batman is the real persona.", "It's a refreshing approach to the genre, even when revisiting years later, in an era inundated with superhero movies where each tries to better the last's visual effects budget.", "Nolan takes an admirable stab at developing a character-driven drama, only to give in to generic action-movie conventions with a blinding, deafening, explosion-laden finale that could have capped off any number of interchangeable Jerry Bruckheimer flicks.", "Batman Begins summons up moments of great eloquence and power. If only its cast of characters was as fully inhabited as its turbulent city.", "Christopher Nolan made something special with his Batman films and it feels like Batman Begins is often overlooked due to the reputation of The Dark Knight. Fans should at least appreciate Batman Begins in a similar light if not a slightly brighter one."], "rating": ["3/5", "8/10", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "B", "", "4.5/5", "4/5", "B+", "3/4", "4/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "4.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "Siddhant Adlakha", "David Walsh", "PJ Nabarro", "Josh Wilding", "Micheal Compton", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Danielle Solzman", "Miles Fielder", "Rachel Wagner", "Namrata Joshi", "PJ Nabarro", "Zaki Hasan", "Dorothy Woodend", "Sean Axmaker", "Jess Lomas", "Christy Lemire", "Joe Morgenstern", "Chris Sawin"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IGN Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ComicBookMovie.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Solzy at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The List", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Outlook", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Zaki&#39;s Corner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Tyee (British Columbia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Stream on Demand", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Quickflix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Rundown"], "date": ["January 31, 2021", "September 25, 2020", "August 28, 2020", "July 9, 2020", "June 9, 2020", "February 15, 2020", "November 19, 2019", "November 6, 2019", "September 22, 2019", "April 24, 2019", "April 15, 2019", "January 8, 2019", "November 4, 2018", "November 2, 2018", "August 24, 2017", "February 12, 2016", "July 7, 2014", "April 14, 2013", "April 14, 2013", "July 21, 2012"]}}
