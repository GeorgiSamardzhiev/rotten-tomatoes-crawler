{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the late 1950s and early '60s, artist Walter Keane (Christoph Waltz) achieves unbelievable fame and success with portraits of saucer-eyed waifs. However, no one realizes that his wife, Margaret (Amy Adams), is the real painter behind the brush. Although Margaret is horrified to learn that Walter is passing off her work as his own, she is too meek to protest too loudly. It isn't until the Keanes' marriage comes to an end and a lawsuit follows that the truth finally comes to light.", "rating": "72", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Tim Burton", "studio": "TimBurton,ElectricCityEntertainment", "theater_date": "Dec 25, 2014", "dvd_date": "Oct 29, 2016", "box_office": "$14.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A skillful, if a little thin look at an artist's soul and the soulless shark who tried to steal it from her.", "The stranger-than-fiction biopic Big Eyes is only the second of [Tim Burton's] non-animated pictures to have a woman at its center, and, perhaps not surprisingly, it's one of the richest portraits he's brought to the screen yet.", "Even during its best moments, the film is only a simple, small, pleasant digression.", "The movie has merit as a depiction of an unusual episode in art history. Unfortunately, the director does not probe the incident in any depth, and what he does make of it is largely wrong.", "It cannot be denied that it is picturesque at times, but only to support the provocative histrionics of the neurotic performances of Christoph Waltz and Amy Adams. [Full review in Spanish]", "Big Eyes remains watchable thanks to Adams and Waltz, its few moments of Burtonesque flair, and the fascinating story it tells about art in the last half-century.", "Big Eyes works because it gets the fundamentals of acting, directing, and screenwriting right. As in music, individual genius is great, but there's just no substitute for a band with good chemistry.", "[Amy] Adams' performance is refreshing and light, taking us on a powerful emotional journey performed with nuanced skill and heart.", "It's a likeable recapitulation of 1950s era America and the strange mutations that occur involving those humans attempting to buck the wrongly conditioned trappings of gender based social mores.", "DoP Bruno Delbonell buffs Burton's kitsch pop visuals to a soft sheen, but, like the script, they never dig deep enough into the emotional heart of this fascinating real-life story.", "It's a smooth, dreamy-looking film on the surface, but its two leads, Amy Adams and Christoph Waltz, are so out of sync and polarized they spoil the movie like acid curdles milk.", "It is a rare misstep for Burton who seems unsure what tone to adopt throughout. Certain visual and inventive flourishes of his are evident...et, he treats the vital moments in the story in a humdrum manner.", "Big Eyes proves to be an entertaining and enlightening look at society and its ideals.", "A melodrama with a comic touch, Big Eyes, is not meant to be a masterpiece, rather, an entertaining piece of art.", "BIG EYES doesn't aim too high and could be a way for Burton to quietly start coming back into form, even if that form is derivative of earlier work.", "The bizarre dysfunction afoot in the Keanes' marriage brings the best out of Burton as a filmmaker, who knows he is working with sensational material here.", "I'd certainly prefer to see more films like this from Burton rather than see him return to his old, worn-out habits.", "Margaret [Keane] might have experienced her awakening, but those expecting for Tim Burton's have to wait for the next round.", "An incredible feminist journey and via his manipulation of the medium and our complicity transforms a domestic thriller into a work of art about art.", "The movie is big and amusing, and the shots of streets full of pastel vintage automobiles are worth the price of admission. It's terrific holiday fare."], "rating": ["3.5/5", "", "5/10", "", "6/10", "", "", "", "3/5", "3/5", "6.5/10", "", "", "", "C+", "3.5/5", "8/10", "", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Andi Zeisler", "Mike Massie", "Joanne Laurier", "Yasser Medina", "Benjamin Sutton", "Chris McCoy", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Nicholas Bell", "Tom Bond", "Bernard Boo", "Paula Fleri-Soler", "Amanda Greever", "Nathalia Aryani", "James Clay", "Leigh Paatsch", "Jennifer Heaton", "Nguyen Le", "Anne Brodie", "Marcianne Miller"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bitch Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hyperallergic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Way Too Indie", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times of Malta", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Daily Times (Tennessee)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Diego Entertainer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fresh Fiction", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternative Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Script Lab", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">What She Said", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bold Life (Hendersonville, NC)"], "date": ["February 2, 2021", "January 22, 2021", "December 4, 2020", "August 11, 2020", "June 26, 2020", "February 1, 2020", "January 9, 2020", "December 14, 2019", "September 19, 2019", "May 17, 2019", "March 20, 2019", "February 27, 2019", "January 31, 2019", "January 25, 2019", "December 8, 2018", "November 29, 2018", "November 1, 2018", "October 10, 2018", "August 30, 2018", "August 26, 2018"]}}
