{"metadata": {"synopsis": "For Buffy Summers (Kristy Swanson), nothing is the same after she meets Merrick Jamison-Smythe (Donald Sutherland). Merrick tells the teen that he's been sent to train her to fight vampires, and he proves himself by displaying his supernatural powers. Buffy is a quick study, and soon takes fellow student Oliver Pike (Luke Perry) under her wing, repeatedly saving him from fierce bloodsuckers. But, when a very dangerous vampire (Rutger Hauer) gets rambunctious, she must go to war again.", "rating": "36", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Horror", "runtime": "1h 26m", "director": "Fran Rubel Kuzui", "studio": "MutantEnemy", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 2, 2017", "box_office": "$14.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There's ultimately never a point at which Buffy the Vampire Slayer is entirely (or even partially) able to live up to the seemingly foolproof nature of its high-concept premise...", "As silly as its title suggests, Buffy the Vampire Slayer manages to deliver a sly message about female strength and the fragility of sexual stereotypes.", "While it would be a mistake to oversell \"Buffy the Vampire Slayer,\" the sad and/or happy truth is that you could do worse on a warm summer night.
