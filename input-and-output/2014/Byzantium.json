I'm instantly sold. [Full review in Spanish].", "Arterton and Ronan's characters have the determination and brio of true heroines.", "Neil Jordan is not trying to reinvent the vampire mythos with Byzantium, but he does manage to give us something that tries to be new and different, and while it's predictable, sometimes manages to be engaging.", "What resonates most about Byzantium aren't its flaws, but its truly remarkable strengths-the themes of identity and trust; the richly textured, alluring imagery; the brilliantly acted relationships.", "f you're looking for something a bit different, Byzantium may have something interesting for you but you'll have to dig through some muck to find it.", "This did not quite do it for me.", "It's melancholia at its most trying.", "The smartest and most rewarding vampire movie of the decade.", "It's a Gothic tale with a twist of conspiracy and a radically different take on vampirism as ancient earth force tightly controlled by a male cabal who treat the transformation like a patriarchal right.", "\"You don't have to be a fang-fetishist to fall in love with Jordan's evocative masterpiece. This is a movie that demands to be just as immortal as its startling heroines.\"", "In the end, the pluses just about outweigh the minuses, thanks to Ronan's performance, one delicious late revelation, and Jordan's enduring mastery of melancholic atmosphere and down-at-heel style.", "A pensive, intelligent vampire-angst movie.", "Arresting, gory and surprising, this flight-of-horror fantasy is wonderfully acted for post-Twilight vamp lovers craving something altogether eerier but emotionally resonant.", "Female-forward and class-conscious, allegorical and adventurous, Byzantium is almost the anti-Batman.", "[Clara and Eleanor] are not technically human, but it's the human relationship between them that the film is confident to show us. And Byzantium seems most comfortable, most intimate, when its two bright actresses give us just that.", "Some \"vampire stuff\" you've seen before, a few new ideas that work, two great performances, and a lot of skilled veterans behind the camera.", "evenly split between a character piece and a mystery thriller...if you're looking for an interesting and different take on vampire legend, check into the Byzantium..."], "rating": ["2/5", "B", "2/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "7.8/10", "6.5/10", "", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "2.5/4", "", "", "3.0/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Brent McKnight", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Federico Furzan", "Amy Taubin", "Nicholas Bell", "Bernard Boo", "Jennifer Heaton", "Eve Tushnet", "Deborah Ross", "Annalee Newitz", "Sean Axmaker", "Chris Alexander", "Matthew Bond", "Mark Juddery", "Larushka Ivan-Zadeh", "Sarah Nicole Prickett", "Kong Rithdee", "Scott Weinberg", "Kevin A.
