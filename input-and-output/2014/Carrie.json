{"metadata": {"synopsis": "High school can be tough for many teenagers, but for Carrie White (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz), it's especially hellish. A shy and awkward teen being raised by a religious zealot (Julianne Moore), Carrie is frequently the target of bullies. But Carrie has a secret talent: She can make things move with her mind. One fateful night, an especially cruel prank at her senior prom pushes her over the edge, and Carrie unleashes her telekinetic powers on all who get in her way.", "rating": "50", "genre": "Horror", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "Kimberly Peirce", "studio": "MisherFilms", "theater_date": "Oct 18, 2013", "dvd_date": "Nov 29, 2016", "box_office": "$35.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Generally there's too much CGI - the floating books are silly - and since when can Carrie fly?", "Carrie resonates for women in particular because it touches on so much of the horror of becoming female that it's almost too real. I love that Kimberly Piece chose to honor that horror faithfully, even if it doesn't make for a radical re-visioning.", "This is the epitome of pointless movie remakes.", "Kimberly Peirce takes a classic film and manages to be both faithful to the original while breathing new life into it.", "Why a new version? Why a remake? Why a reimagination? The answer is because this new 2013 Carrie from director Kimberly Peirce is just that - a reimagination that harkens back to the original source material - [Stephen] King's novel.", "Moretz plays Carrie as either a constantly petrified, meek outcast or a grimacing destroyer. Peirce fails to build a connection between audience and protagonist.", "While this quality remake will never be regarded in the same way, it achieves all the right shocks in a majorly unsettling way.", "The ambition of Peirce, Moretz, and Moore shines through in the film's strongest moments, and though the supporting players and shaky contemporary revisions weigh the film down, Peirce deserves credit for putting up one hell of a fight.", "This is a film that is all about the iconic prom sequence, which is staged well by director Kimberly Peirce, but there really isn't much more to the film.", "Pulls off the unenviable task of being both respectful to the original whilst spicing the story with enough fresh twists that it doesn't appear like a scene-by-scene retread of its forebear.", "There are a lot of good things here: the updates Pierce added make perfect sense, I really loved the special F/X, the score is AMAZING, and the casting is gorgeous.", "There is no way for this Carrie to become a classic -- it is far too close to the earlier film to escape its shadow. However, it works perfectly well and is worth seeing, except for those who abhor the whole notion of remakes.", "It is certainly asking a lot to buy into the shoddy remake of Brian De Palma's 1976 macabre masterpiece Carrie. There needed to be more shock-inducing significance poured onto this callow Carrie besides the standby bucket of pig's blood", "A near word-for-word remake... Kimberly Peirce's version of Carrie is an unnecessary update with its own charm nonetheless (and 100 percent less full-frontal nudity, thankfully).", "Watching the remake of Carrie [over the original] is like replacing your phone with a newer version of the exact same phone.", "Director Kimberly Peirce delivers a worthy remake to a horror classic, while offering enough changes to make it seem fairly fresh.", "While [Chloe Grace Moretz] makes a believable prom queen swan, she's less convincing as an awkward ugly duckling.", "Whilst the kills and gore were mildly entertaining it was incredibly hard to sympathise with a Carrie that was fully aware of her powers and using them in violent ways as opposed to the... unaware Carrie Sissy Spacek gave us in the original.", "An efficient, yet prosaic supernatural thriller that does its best to rework the story to fit in with modern day audiences.", "Many scenes are similar to the 1976 original but this update feels far more like a Mean Girls high school flick, which is actually a good thing."], "rating": ["2.5/5", "", "1/10", "3.0/4", "", "", "3.5/5", "7.4/10", "C-", "3/5", "", "B", "2/4", "", "5/10", "7/10", "", "", "3/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Andi Zeisler", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Udita Jhunjhunwala", "Leigh Paatsch", "Bernard Boo", "Micheal Compton", "Cleaver Patterson", "Amie Simon", "Abbie Bernstein", "Frank Ochieng", "Tara Thorne", "Jennifer Heaton", "Aaron Peterson", "Pat Padua", "Chloe Leeson", "Jamie Neish", "Kaleem Aftab"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bitch Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Livemint", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Way Too Indie", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Three Imaginary Girls", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Assignment X", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">SF Crowsnest", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Coast (Halifax, Nova Scotia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternative Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Hollywood Outsider", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">DCist", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen Queens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The National (UAE)"], "date": ["January 31, 2021", "January 20, 2021", "December 3, 2020", "September 5, 2020", "January 7, 2020", "August 14, 2019", "April 17, 2019", "April 11, 2019", "April 9, 2019", "March 6, 2019", "March 2, 2019", "January 19, 2019", "November 16, 2018", "November 16, 2018", "November 1, 2018", "October 12, 2018", "August 30, 2018", "August 24, 2018", "August 13, 2018", "May 14, 2018"]}}
