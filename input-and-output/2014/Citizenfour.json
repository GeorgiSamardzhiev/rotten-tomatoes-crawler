But she lets the film unfold as a character study, with long silences and lingering close-ups as we watch Snowden come to terms...", "Citizenfour, I had to keep reminding myself, shows us history in the making. I had to keep telling myself what I was seeing was important because most of it is otherwise pretty dull.", "Watching this real-time whistleblowing is nothing short of unbelievable.", "Poitras takes the facts at face value considering her source is an enemy of the state, but the revelations are no less reeling.", "What seems most remarkable in that hotel room in Hong Kong is Snowden's freedom from anxiety.", "Laura Poitras took on a massive project when she set out to make CitizenFour, and she succeeds in capturing and unveiling this extraordinary moment in journalism that we, on the outside, never see.", "Citizenfour creates a powerful dystopia.", "The profoundly personal cost of taking action is rendered explicit in the story of Edward Snowden.", "Poitras isn't there to question his motives or the rightness of his cause, she's there to bear witness. This film is her document on why his actions matter and what it cost Snowden.", "[1984] is looking less like fiction with each passing day.", "Yes, we should be concerned about what our government is up to, but we should also be skeptical of Citizenfour.", "This is film as activism, and documentary filmmaking as dissension.", "This is a brave, bold and important film.", "For all the film's superficial slickness, it's a mess.", "As much as it resembles a conspiracy thriller in which data encryption is a survival tactic, Citizenfour must be considered, above all, a journalistic achievement.", "The most frightening aspect of the documentary is a suggestion that this is only the dawn of what's to come.", "A risky and revelatory documentary weakened only by its awesome source.", "Although Snowden has been depicted by his detractors as a gutless, narcissistic traitor fleeing the law, the Edward Snowden I saw in this film is quite different. He is very intelligent and is aware of the cost of his actions to himself and others.", "Bold docu explores Edward Snowden's controversial actions."], "rating": ["5/5", "", "", "A-", "B", "", "", "B+", "", "", "4/5", "2/5", "", "4.5/5", "", "4/5", "B+", "3/4", "B", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jordan M.
