But it loses credibility by doing so in a melodramatic way.", "A good cast (Brenda Fricker, Hugh Bonneville and assorted veterans of British and Irish film and TV) gives Deery's film weight and credibility.", "[A] fervent yet scattershot film.", "The need to portray the powers-that-be at all levels -- from the Vatican to the local parish -- in the worst possible light intrudes upon the movie, making it feel like a personal vendetta.", "Conspiracy of Silence is well-meaning but has has no faith in its audience.", "Though Conspiracy of Silence misses a chance at being a first-rate drama, it sheds much-needed light on an area that the mainstream press has mysteriously abandoned.", "An often-riveting film.", "The limp thriller plot Deery constructs to frame his theological inquiries is both artificial and not very interesting, a lethal combination.", "Certainly a debate over the church's tradition of an unmarried clergy ... could be a good and worthy one. But a quick, clumsy melodrama -- complete with awkward, pop-scored sex scenes -- isn't the best venue.", "While the subject of enforced priestly celibacy is important, here it is dealt with in a workman-like manner lacking vibrancy.", "Deery's points are well-taken, but they would have been a lot better made if he hadn't taken so many easy shots at the church by demonizing its local authorities.", "For American audiences who have followed recent Church scandals, this less-than-penetrating expos will be of mild interest.", "John Deery's modest drama is one big, obvious argument against the vow of celibacy for Roman Catholic priests, but it has heart.", "For a salting of sex and foul language, John Decry's investigative thriller plays like third-tier P.D. James adapted for TV.", "As stacked as any more secular nonfiction agitprop from the recent election season.", "The story meanders, but the subject is timely and important.", "Conspiracy of Silence is a thoughtful drama about some of the formidable challenges faced by reform-minded Catholics who dare to question the tradition of celibacy."], "rating": ["4/5", "2.5/5", "2/4", "2/4", "3/5", "2/5", "2.5/4", "2/4", "", "3/5", "2/5", "", "2/4", "2/4", "1.5/5", "3/5", "1.5/4", "C", "2/4", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["", "Christopher Null", "Connie Ogle", "Laura Kelly", "Roger Moore", "Steve Schneider", "Ruthe Stein", "Peter Canavese", "Eric Monder", "Kim Williamson", "Maitland McDonagh", "Stephen Whitty", "V.A.
