{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Ten years after simian flu wiped out much of the world's homosapiens, genetically enhanced chimpanzee Caesar (Andy Serkis) and his ever-growing band of followers have established a thriving colony just outside San Francisco in Muir Woods. Meanwhile, a small band of human survivors emerges, which forces Caesar -- as leader -- to grapple with the dual challenge of protecting his people and re-establishing a relationship with the remaining human population -- the latter being Caesar's secret wish.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 10m", "director": "Matt Reeves", "studio": "CherninEntertainment", "theater_date": "Jul 11, 2014", "dvd_date": "Dec 1, 2015", "box_office": "$208.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A smart movie about race, gun usage and xenophobia. Its masked in allegory but it doesn't shy away from big ideas and that's the thing that transforms it from a run-of-the-mill air conditioner flick to a thought provoking night and exciting at the movies.", "Though it may be a single component to a larger picture, which will likely see director Matt Reeves return to finish off the tale, it's wholly enjoyable all by itself.", "Serkis, and maybe even Kebbell, deserve awards attention here for their nothing short of inspiring performances.", "[Andy Serkis] has become the Roddy McDowall of Planet of the Apes franchise, delivering the emotion and heart that makes Caesar come to life just like his predecessor did as Cornelius.", "Epic and bold, it, in true Apes fashion, aims to examine the animal in man by looking at the more human side of the animals.", "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes carries on the strong story begun in Rise and improves on it.", "More than it being boring, more than it being sort of oatmeal-y, the biggest problem with this movie is the score. It's really distracting.", "It was competently made... for the most part.", "The result is a powerful, well-structured yet slightly biased sequel that further justifies the Planet of the Apes reboot or at least the origins of the franchise.", "There are enough impressive elements to power through its basic tendencies, due mostly to the riveting special effects and primate storylines, and yet another aggressively engaging presence from Andy Serkis.", "The most important thing is this: although these Apes have ditched some of the trippier elements, they have retained the social awareness and have infused summer spectacle with humanistic moralizing.", "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes is the tonic that proves brilliant, deep films can be made by a Hollywood major.", "In a world where simple black and white morality is popular, there are few Hollywood films, especially with this large a budget, that could ever tackle such complex thematic material.", "The special effects... still felt really real and lush and natural.", "The first half is dull and predictable, but Dawn just about earns its stars with a flurry of shocks and showdowns in the second half.", "Though it juggles multiple characters struggling with inner conflicts inside of a larger external conflict, the film never feels unstable, confusing, or lopsided.", "It apes it in terms of engaging and emotional entertainment courtesy of a tight script, jaw-dropping visuals and superb performances, most especially from Andy Serkis.", "Engulfs you in its world from the opening frame, seamlessly using CGI to create one of the most impressive visual experiences of recent memory.", "It's a steady, solid film that gets the job done. If you can ride out the slow, action-deprived stretches, you might come away with similar opinions.", "As post-apocalyptic parables go, Dawn Of The Planet Of The Apes is good. As a remake of Battle For The Planet Of The Apes it's great -- and will be heartwarming to most Apes fans of yore."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "8/10", "3.5/4", "4.5/5", "A", "", "", "6.5/10", "4/5", "3/5", "B+", "5/5", "3/4", "A+", "4/5", "9/10", "", "", "", "A-"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Brent McKnight", "Damond Fudge", "Avaryl Halley", "Andrew Galdi", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Nicholas Bell", "Ryan Syrek", "Leslie Combemale", "Matthew Lucas", "Rachel Wagner", "Tom Bond", "Bernard Boo", "Paula Fleri-Soler", "Micheal Compton", "Amanda Greever", "Abbie Bernstein"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Confessions From A Geek Mind", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KCCI (Des Moines, IA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flick Feast", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Reader (Omaha, NE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rachel&#39;s Reviews (YouTube)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Way Too Indie", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times of Malta", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Daily Times (Tennessee)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Assignment X"], "date": ["February 1, 2021", "December 4, 2020", "September 5, 2020", "July 16, 2020", "July 7, 2020", "June 29, 2020", "May 26, 2020", "March 26, 2020", "November 20, 2019", "August 30, 2019", "August 6, 2019", "August 2, 2019", "July 5, 2019", "June 28, 2019", "June 15, 2019", "March 28, 2019", "March 5, 2019", "February 1, 2019", "January 31, 2019", "January 12, 2019"]}}
