{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A new English teacher, John Keating (Robin Williams), is introduced to an all-boys preparatory school that is known for its ancient traditions and high standards. He uses unorthodox methods to reach out to his students, who face enormous pressures from their parents and the school. With Keating's help, students Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) and others learn to break out of their shells, pursue their dreams and seize the day.", "rating": "84", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 8m", "director": "Peter Weir", "studio": "TouchstonePictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 9, 2016", "box_office": "$94.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A refreshing if obvious drama.", "On the surface Robin Williams appears to be giving his standard performance as Prof. Keating - witty, sincere and lovable. But there's much more here.", "I can't help but melt underneath this movie: it chisels away the cynic and gets at the sap.", "Dead Poets Society purports to be about the bravery of following one's own path. This is a bright, shining lie, one the film is ballsy enough to tell to your face.", "It's not so easy to dismiss Dead Poets Society. For all its faults, it still has as much power as it ever did.", "Williams keeps a stiff upper lip, showing a more sedate and sensitive side, and the Oscar-winning screenplay provides a strong backbone.", "Falters when it goes for too much heart-tugging manipulation.", "Inspiring, intense story of a teacher and his students.", "Beautifully directed and with an Oscar-winning story.", "Williams, who has comparatively little screen time, has come to act, not to cut comic riffs, and he does so with forceful, ultimately compelling, simplicity.", "A film that celebrates the importance of inspiration, albeit in slightly affected fashion.", "A bundle of growing pain blues, flamboyant declarations of self, and doomsday faculty foul-ups, and it cooks when delivered in big batches of adolescent passion.", "Watch \"Dead Poets Society\" and you'll see the efforts of a filmmaker who has his own loving style in making movies.", "Though sentimental and contrived, this valentine to charismatic, dedicated teachers is extremely well acted (even by Robin Williams) and it does make you feel good about loving literature and poetry.", "Above average drama that put Robin Williams on dramatic actor map.", "Robin Williams at his tolerable best.", "", "The role of Keating is a plum assignment for the talented Williams, who largely steers clear of schtick under Peter Weir's direction. Nicely shot with a good youthful cast.", "Story sings whenever Williams is onscreen. Screen belongs just as often to Leonard, who as Neil has a quality of darting confidence mixed with hesitancy. Hawke, as the painfully shy Todd, gives a haunting performance.", "The moral divisions set up between characters are childishly overdrawn; and, worst of all, the behavior shown by the boys and adults frequently reeks of falsity and contrivance."], "rating": ["3/4", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "", "", "7/10", "B-", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "B-", "9/10", "B+", "4/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3/4", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Gene Siskel", "Hank Gallo", "Josh Larsen", "Odie Henderson", "Jeffrey M.
