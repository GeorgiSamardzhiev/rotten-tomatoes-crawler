{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Upon arriving in Edinburgh, Scotland for a series of mind-boggling performances, master illusionist Harry Houdini (Guy Pearce) offers an impressive cash reward to any supposed psychic who can accurately tell him his late mother's exact last words. Gorgeous swindler Mary McGarvie (Catherine Zeta-Jones) rises to the challenge and engages Houdini in a dangerous flirtation that will blur the line between reality and paranoia -- and test the very limits of his skepticism.", "rating": "42", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense/Romance", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Gillian Armstrong", "studio": "MyriadPictures,BBCFilms,AustralianFilmFinanceCorporation", "theater_date": "Jul 11, 2008", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$3.6K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Every line spoken is so austere that the characters seem like they're acting in straitjackets. But it's the audience that will be most desperate to escape.", "It's a shame that the story itself feels like smoke and mirrors with nowhere to go, wanting to have its cake and eat it too.", "Death Defying Acts is a hugely enjoyable, impressively directed drama with superb performances and an emotionally engaging script. Terrific final scene too. Highly recommended.", "Any magic is instantly dispelled by the dead hand of a tirelessly pouting Zeta-Jones, whose slap boasts more layers than her talent.", "It's all a touch undercooked and dull.", "It's a movie that seems to have been lavished with care and performed with gusto, yet its tale of fakery sounds its own knell: there's not a believable moment in it.", "A watchable, enjoyable but fairly forgettable film, Death Defying Acts has plenty of smoke and mirrors and not quite enough magic.", "It's pretty but dull, with Pearce and Zeta-Jones never convincing as supposedly hot-for-each other rivals.", "It all looks pretty enough - but well before the end you'll be plotting your escape.", "This is better than the dull Edward Norton vehicle The Illusionist, all involved should have conjured up a companion piece to Christopher Nolan's The Prestige.", "And while less magical than The Prestige, it's perfectly charming matine fare.", "The movie is over-schematic, slow-moving and over-furnished. It never seems to come alive with any believable interplay of characters; the movie locks itself into a watertight tank of a premise, and the handcuffs won't come off.", "Houdini's mission to debunk fake spiritualists is hijacked by this wholly fraudulent love story. There's not a moment in the film that feels honest and uncontrived.", "A pleasant, frothy period confection that's as decorative and insubstantial as Zeta Jones's character.", "All in all, it's a bit of a snore that falls back on romance when all else fails.", "Despite the confused tone and underwhelming romance, this pretty little picture entertains in the main thanks to the intriguing subject matter and top turns from Zeta-Jones and Ronan.", "excepting experimental films, plot is a key reason we watch movies. Without an interesting one, an hour and a half of competent filmmaking becomes about an hour and 25 minutes of boredom.", "Perhaps the film isn't a grandiose statement of splintered lives, but it's an agreeable drama, best when it stays close to the decomposing heart of a professional liar.", "...a decidedly minor addition to the rsum of Australian director Gillian Armstrong...The film moves quickly enough, and it's a passably glossy entertainment, but, as Houdini, Pearce is too young...", "Director Gilliam Anderson doesn't distinguish this generic romance from a thousand other costumed bodice rippers -- is a kinky handcuff scene too much to ask?"], "rating": ["", "3.5/5", "4/5", "", "2/5", "2/5", "3/5", "", "2/5", "2/5", "", "2/5", "2/5", "3/5", "2/6", "3/5", "", "B", "", "C"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Kaleem Aftab", "Rich Cline", "Matthew Turner", "Larushka Ivan-Zadeh", "Derek Malcolm", "Anthony Quinn", "", "", "Philip Kemp", "Rob Daniel", "Sukhdev Sandhu", "Peter Bradshaw", "Wendy Ide", "Anna Smith", "Dave Calhoun", "Anna Smith", "Sean Gandert", "Brian Orndorf", "Andy Klein", "Amy Nicholson"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The National (UAE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Shadows on the Wall", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ViewLondon", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Sun (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Mirror (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sky Cinema", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Paste Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">BrianOrndorf.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles CityBeat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">I.E.
