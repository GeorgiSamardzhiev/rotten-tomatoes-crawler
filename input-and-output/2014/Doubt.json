Father Flynn (Philip Seymour Hoffman), a charismatic priest, is advocating reform of the school's strict customs, and the first black student has just been accepted. When a fellow nun (Amy Adams) tells Sister Aloysius that Father Flynn may be paying too much personal attention to the student, Sister Aloysius begins a personal crusade against the priest -- despite her lack of evidence.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "John Patrick Shanley", "studio": "ScottRudinProductions", "theater_date": "Dec 25, 2008", "dvd_date": "Dec 17, 2015", "box_office": "$33.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Shanley apparently accepts everything about the world.
