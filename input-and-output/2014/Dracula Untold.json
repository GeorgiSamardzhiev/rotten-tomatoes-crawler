{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 15th-century Transylvania, Vlad III (Luke Evans), prince of Wallachia, is known as a just ruler. With his beloved wife, Mirena (Sarah Gadon), Vlad has brokered a prolonged period of peace and ensured that his people are protected, especially from the Ottoman Empire. However, when Sultan Mehmed II (Dominic Cooper) demands 1,000 of the country's boys, including Vlad's son, for his army, Vlad makes a deal with a monster that will enable him to defeat the Turks -- but cost him his humanity.", "rating": "25", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Gary Shore", "studio": "MichaelDeLuca", "theater_date": "Oct 10, 2014", "dvd_date": "Aug 16, 2016", "box_office": "$55.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Doesn't totally suck despite playing like the set-up to the inevitable modern day sequel they pitch in the film's coda.", "For any one who wants to just have a fun time watching a vampire movie without being either bored or scared I strongly recommend this title for you.", "Even though this is a silly and absurd retelling of the popular legend, you know what else it is? It's also a lot of fun.", "I love a good antihero as much as the next critic, but Dracula's just not hero material. Even when he's awkwardly crammed into a heroic role, he doesn't behave heroically. He behaves like Vlad The Impaler, and we're supposed to cheer his brutality.", "An origin story that is fresh in ideology, painting a different and previously unseen picture of Vlad, a very human portrait of a man forced to face his own mortality and humanity out of love, leading him to his ultimate destiny.", "Neither Luke Evans nor his action star physique has the prowess to make Dracula Untold anything more than a series of pretty but empty headed action sequences.", "Like a mix between Braveheart and a literal bat-man, Transylvania's favorite son has been reformatted and given a plot full of the worst moments from The Lord of the Rings series.", "The film that has the potential to soar is thwarted by its saccharine moments and a lack of directorial confidence.", "Sometimes, what a film needs is a good script, and this proves that some stories are probably best left untold.", "Dracula Untold has a surprisingly soft bite -- succumbing to PG-13 level violence. It's a movie that clearly allowed the film to expand to a larger audience, but it also takes away some of the suspense and menace.", "Dracula Untold has its flaws, but when it works, it soars like a flock of bats.", "Dracula Untold tries to do something different with the character's mythology but buckles from trying to do too much in too little time.", "[Dracula Untold] gives us a nonsensical picture of a tortured hero, forced by nobility into his life of mutilation. Even with stellar performances, it is a story that was better off Untold.", "As long as you don't really associate Untold with any previous Dracula renditions or think about the history behind it, then it's a relatively fun and painless popcorn-munching storm.", "You can't really have a better B-movie experience than Dracula Untold.", "If you start watching it knowing full well it's not going to be a horror picture, you can have a pretty good time. [Full Review in Spanish]", "It doesn't matter if the rumors of Universal wanting a cinematic universe based on their mythological horror monsters is true or not, this movie killed whatever chance that had of happening.", "It's the whole \"family man\" thing that makes this film such a strange ride.", "This is essentially Evans's vehicle. His version of Dracula is action-oriented rather than horrifying and creepy. And keeping that in mind, he manages, in most parts, to get his teeth into the substance of Count Dracula's legend convincingly enough.", "You made a vampire movie with no gore: Congratulations, you're Twilight."], "rating": ["3/5", "6/10", "C+", "", "", "2/5", "C", "2/5", "", "C", "B", "4/10", "5/10", "", "", "3/4", "2/5", "", "3/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Tony Asankomah", "Allen Almachar", "Chris McCoy", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Nicholas Bell", "Ryan Syrek", "Ellena Zellhuber-McMillan", "Paula Fleri-Soler", "Micheal Compton", "Abbie Bernstein", "Jennifer Heaton", "Aaron Peterson", "Chloe Leeson", "Annalee Newitz", "Sebastian Zavala Kahn", "Robert Kojder", "Josh Terry", "Reagan Gavin Rasquinha", "Sarah Marrs"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">GhMovieFreak", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Reader (Omaha, NE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times of Malta", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Assignment X", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternative Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Hollywood Outsider", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen Queens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">io9.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinencuentro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flickering Myth", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Deseret News (Salt Lake City)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Times of India", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinesnark"], "date": ["February 2, 2021", "November 20, 2020", "July 17, 2020", "January 8, 2020", "December 14, 2019", "September 6, 2019", "July 30, 2019", "June 15, 2019", "February 27, 2019", "January 25, 2019", "January 10, 2019", "November 1, 2018", "October 24, 2018", "August 24, 2018", "May 23, 2018", "January 30, 2018", "December 2, 2017", "November 28, 2017", "November 11, 2017", "October 18, 2017"]}}
