{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Deep in the swamps of Louisiana, disfigured psychotic Judd (Neville Brand) manages a sleazy, decaying motel. Upon learning that one of his guests is a prostitute, he promptly impales her with a pitchfork and tosses her to the crocodile that stalks the nearby waters. This is just the first in a series of slayings, and, as the croc's belly begins to bulge with victims, people grow suspicious. Outsiders begin to poke around the motel, but Judd simply sees them as more treats for his pet.", "rating": "35", "genre": "Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Tobe Hooper", "studio": "MarsProductionsCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 25, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Perversely entertaining, Eaten Alive is a unique curiosity piece from the great horror filmmaker Tobe Hooper.", "Attained a certain level of cult classic status.", "A film like this endures as entertainment because all the performances are pitched at that joyous trajectory of cartoonish excess.", "Containing laughably high levels of violence, sex and sadism that become near numbing by the final reel, Eaten Alive! is possibly the cruelest, most tasteless entry into a collection already known for being utterly reprehensible.", "The plot is pretty much what you'd expect from a horror film that involves a disturbed hotel worker who keeps an alligator for a pet...", "Hooper's film, despite its apparent focus on zoology, is really an experiment in baroque Texpressionism, dominated by concerns of an anthropological, ethnographic nature.", "A bizarre and largely flawed little beast, but I was pleased with the injected anarchy and direction from Hooper.", "Just something that those with a morbid curiosity for the unusual in sleaze might not be able to pass on.", "[Its] off-the-wall hybridization of Tennessee Williams, Alfred Hitchcock (Psycho, specifically), and Lucio Fulci is more often than not sloppy.", "With an enviable, well-stocked cast of character thespians and a carefully dilapidated motel set, Eaten Alive is all ingredients, no recipe.", "This bayou-set, thinly imagined Psycho knock-off is little more than a derisible piece of slasher mayhem, notable for Tobe Hooper's association and costar Roberta Collins' assertion that star Neville Brand later tried to sexually assault her.", "The movie is called Eaten Alive, but we get very little in terms of dinner and dessert in the horror department.", "One is tempted to wonder aloud if drugs and booze didn't actually direct this relatively woeful flick.", "", "Above average horror from Hooper with a satiric bent", "will always be more of a curiosity piece than a truly satisfying movie in and of itself", "Hooper's sophomore effort, which had a bigger budget but is lesser-known, repeats the same basic formula."], "rating": ["3/5", "2.5/4", "3/4", "", "5/10", "", "", "C+", "C+", "2/4", "D-", "", "2/5", "2/5", "3/5", "2.5/4", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "Richard Propes", "David Keyes", "Jacob Knight", "Ford Maddox Brown", "Anton Bitel", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Dennis Schwartz", "Nick Schager", "Eric Henderson", "Brent Simon", "Staci Layne Wilson", "Scott Weinberg", "Emanuel Levy", "Ken Hanke", "James Kendrick", "Dustin Putman"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaphile.org", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Birth.Movies.Death.", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Starburst", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">FilmLand Empire", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lessons of Darkness", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slant Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Now Playing Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Horror.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">DVDTalk.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Q Network Film Desk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheFilmFile.com"], "date": ["October 20, 2020", "September 7, 2020", "August 3, 2020", "February 27, 2018", "February 3, 2016", "May 21, 2015", "July 9, 2009", "May 4, 2009", "January 11, 2007", "September 27, 2006", "September 23, 2006", "September 7, 2006", "July 10, 2006", "June 18, 2005", "August 21, 2002", "February 27, 2001", "January 1, 2000"]}}
