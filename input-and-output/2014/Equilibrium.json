{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In a futuristic world, a regime has eliminated war by suppressing emotions: books, art and music are strictly forbidden and feeling is a crime punishable by death. Clerick John Preston (Christian Bale) is a top-ranking government agent responsible for destroying those who resist these rules. When he misses a dose of Prozium, a mind-altering drug that hinders emotion, Preston, who has been trained to enforce strict laws of the new regime, suddenly becomes the one capable of overthrowing it.", "rating": "41", "genre": "Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Kurt Wimmer", "studio": "DimensionFilms,BlueTulip", "theater_date": "Dec 6, 2002", "dvd_date": "Apr 9, 2016", "box_office": "$1.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The costuming, set designs, and music (by Klaus Badelt, which is actually spectacular) are far more impressive than anyone might expect.", "Though ultimately silly, Equilibrium's shopworn but stylish synthesis of ammo and ideas is surprisingly engrossing.", "A balanced thriller.", "Kurt Wimmer's Equilibrium is a dreary sci-fi action movie set after the Third World War in a dystopia from which all dangerous human emotion has been drained by the daily injection of the drug Prozium and the burning of art and books.", "This medium-budgeted, futuristic action tale that arrives on screens with precious little fanfare is, to my mind, the best film I've seen all year.", "Despite often being preposterous and heavy-handed, there are enough slick visuals to offset the overall silliness, and the displays of \"Gun-kata\" - a blend of martial arts and gunplay - provide some blistering action scenes.", "It's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story.", "Violent post-nuclear sci-fi is Orwellian.", "Channels the themes of George Orwell and the action of John Woo wonderfully.", "Who knew that a reunion of Metroland stars Bale and Watson could yield something so downright nutty?", "", "An engaging ride, with some quicksilver moves.", "Bale is too self-conscious an action hero, and although the script may have the virtue of transparent plagiarism, it teeters both dramatically and conceptually.", "", "It only adds unneeded celluloid to an increasingly tired genre!", "C'est un film qui rivalise avec les plus gros blockbusters hollywoodiens.
