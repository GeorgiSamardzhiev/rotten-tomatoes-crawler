{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The story - which crosses both sexual and racial lines - revolves around a privileged suburban family whose lives are filled with daily family etiquette, social events at the club, and an overall desire to keep up with the Joneses. The family is turned upside down when both husband and wife are faced with choices that not only create a gossip mill for the entire community but also change their entire lives forever.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Todd Haynes", "studio": "SectionEightLtd.,KillerFilms,USAFilms,ClearBlueSkyProductions,JohnWellsProductions", "theater_date": "Nov 22, 2002", "dvd_date": "Feb 12, 2014", "box_office": "$15.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["When a movie gets it all impeccably, heartbreakingly right, as does Todd Haynes' stunning Far from Heaven, some critics are tempted to gush deepest purple...I'll try to stay anchored to more sensible levels of bliss.", "Perhaps one of the most remarkable tributes by one filmmaker to another ever made.", "Writer-director Todd Haynes' modern masterpiece wasn't merely the best film of 2002; it also ranked as one of the 10 best films of its decade.", "Haynes was miraculously able to provide a commentary on class, gender and race relations that not only dissected the utopian fallacy of '50s America but made it resonate today", "I'll say two things about an Oscar nomination for Julianne Moore for best actress: for sure and at least.", "With a classic storytelling style bordering on corniness, a deft tragicomic touch and a heroic refusal to use the safety net of irony, Haynes has managed to produce something of a gem.", "Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid are outstanding as Cathy and Frank Whitaker, a perfect couple with a decidedly imperfect love life.", "Far From Heaven should create a wider audience for Haynes, long considered one of America's leading independent directors.", "The actors move about this elaborate movie museum in a modified dream state, as if living in the present while rooted in the past. But the strategy doesn't work. It's an imitation of lifelessness.", "We are left wondering why, in any case, an imitation Sirk was needed, what appetite or interest it might fill. Even with its latter-day (modified) frankness, Far From Heaven is only thin glamour that lacks a tacit wry base.", "With tact and care, the movie digs into all the subjects that lay concealed below the surface when Max Ophuls and Douglas Sirk were filming their own melodramas in the nineteen-fifties.", "Quaid makes a decent man's anguish richly palpable. Moore makes us feel hidden frenzy with a cool and ultimately heartbreaking grace.", "Haynes doesn't simply take a Norman Rockwell setting and release the hounds, either. He deals with these issues directly, but gently, as if his and Sirk's audiences were the same.", "Todd Haynes has crafted a feature-length homage to Sirk that succeeds both on its own terms and as the Sirk film that could never have been made in his own lifetime.", "Could Haynes go on making films if the health police were ever to let up? He apparently needs to define himself in opposition to their controlling mindset.", "Moore gives one of the year's great performances -- subtle, lingeringly rich -- in director Todd Haynes's peculiar revisionist homage to old Hollywood women's pictures.", "This exquisite evocation of the 1950s tear-jerkers of director Douglas Sirk is gorgeously designed, stunningly photographed, ravishingly scored and beautifully acted.", "The arthouse Pleasantville, this handsomely crafted facsimile of '50s melodrama is unengaging and redundant, the lacquered artifice erecting a barrier between screen and audience.", "Haynes' loving homage to the Technicolor female-driven melodramas of the 1950s looks and feels so authentic, it will make you forget you are watching a new movie.", "A takeoff on Douglas Sirk's overwrought, color-saturated 1950s melodramas that rises above its camp roots and converts artifice into art."], "rating": ["", "4/4", "4/4", "4/5", "A-", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "5/5", "2/5", "", "4.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Joshua Rothkopf", "Matthew Lucas", "Matt Brunson", "PJ Nabarro", "Joel Siegel", "Barbara Ellen", "Kate Muir", "Steffen Silvis", "Joe Morgenstern", "Stanley Kauffmann", "Anthony Lane", "Richard Schickel", "Jack Mathews", "Keith Phipps", "Stuart Klawans", "Tom Gliatto", "Alan Jones", "", "Christy Lemire", "Erin Podolsky"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">In These Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">From the Front Row", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Frenzy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Good Morning America", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Willamette Week", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New Republic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Nation", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro Times (Detroit, MI)"], "date": ["March 16, 2020", "May 18, 2019", "March 23, 2019", "December 15, 2018", "January 4, 2018", "January 3, 2018", "December 3, 2015", "April 1, 2014", "April 1, 2014", "April 1, 2014", "April 1, 2014", "April 1, 2014", "April 1, 2014", "April 1, 2014", "April 1, 2014", "April 1, 2014", "April 1, 2014", "April 1, 2014", "April 1, 2014", "April 1, 2014"]}}
