In the movie nothing of value has been eliminated, but nothing of interest has been added.", "Though not one of Oscar and Hammerstein best works, this Oscar-nominated musical about culture clash merits a viewing.", "Flower Drum Song has been overwhelmed by the sheer opulence and glamour with which Ross Hunter has translated it to the screen.
