{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Will Hunting (Matt Damon) has a genius-level IQ but chooses to work as a janitor at MIT. When he solves a difficult graduate-level math problem, his talents are discovered by Professor Gerald Lambeau (Stellan Skarsgard), who decides to help the misguided youth reach his potential. When Will is arrested for attacking a police officer, Professor Lambeau makes a deal to get leniency for him if he will get treatment from therapist Sean Maguire (Robin Williams).", "rating": "98", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 6m", "director": "Gus Van Sant", "studio": "MiramaxFilms,BeGentlemenLimitedPartnership,LawrenceBenderProductions", "theater_date": "Jan 9, 1998", "dvd_date": "Apr 14, 2016", "box_office": "$138.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["What Matt Damon and Ben Affleck accomplish with such a profound, witty, inspirational and heartbreaking script is quite extraordinary. And then, Mr. Robin Williams takes it to another level. [Full review in Spanish]", "The acting is outstanding; Williams and Damon perfectly embody their roles, creating a believable, poignant, powerful partnership full of uplifting, feel-good triumphs.", "On the surface there doesn't seem to be too much going on, but dig a little deeper and you'll find remarkably telling insights into the mind games that go with being a genius.", "The film offers Robin Williams the chance to show his dramatic acting skills.", "Good Will Hunting is lyrically directed, efficiently written, side-splittingly funny, quietly devastating.", "The movie... [is] surprisingly moving, though resolutely unsentimental, rites-of-passage yarn.", "It's a deceptively good performance by Williams: the schmaltzy raw materials of Maguire would seem to be a trap, but he plays it absolutely straight, in muted, dignified tones", "The headline story from this slice of honestly earned sentiment is Matt Damon, who delivers the year's No. 1 breakthrough performance directly atop his agreeable high-profile turn in John Grisham's The Rainmaker.", "It's a movie that captures (in a way that perhaps an older screenwriter could not convey) the limitless possibilities of youth, a movie in which a character can tell another, without cynicism, \"You could do anything you want. You are bound by nothing.\"", "The best thing about Good Will Hunting is not in its well-crafted, psychological symmetries but in the just-plain messiness of its humanity. It's rowdy, it's funny, it's heartbreaking -- it rings of life.", "A crowd-pleaser, with bags of charm to spare.", "Most movies about troubled individuals are insulting in the way in which they suddenly wrap things up with insipid developments that cause tumultuous, positive transformations in the protagonist; this film avoids that pitfall.", "Towering performance by Matt Damon as a troubled working class who needs to address his creative genius elevates this drama way above its therapeutic approach, resulting in a zeitgeist film that may touch chord with young viewers the way The Graduate did", "Despite its coarse exterior, Good Will Hunting proves to be a rather positive and motivational experience.", "The film works as a character-driven narrative because Mr. Van Sant and his co-screenwriters are not afraid to unlock the psychological mysteries of their five major characters with clear and concise dialogue.", "Can get overly sentimental at times, but Gus Van Sant's sensitive direction... and his excellent use of the city make it a hugely entertaining and effective film.", "It's acted and directed with care, and Damon is outstanding, his scenes with Driver being especially sparky.", "", "The film succeeds not because of an overall arc, but as a chain of smaller moments that glimmer in their minuscule perfection.", ""], "rating": ["4/5", "7/10", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "A-", "B", "", "", "", "4/5", "4/4", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Fico Cangiano", "Mike Massie", "Leigh Paatsch", "Richard Propes", "Roxana Hadadi", "David Baron", "PJ Nabarro", "Mike Clark", "Jason Bailey", "Duane Byrge", "Quentin Curtis", "Matt Brunson", "Emanuel Levy", "Gary Brown", "Andrew Sarris", "Jeffrey M.
