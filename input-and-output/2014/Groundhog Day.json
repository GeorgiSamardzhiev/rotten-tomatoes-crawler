Keep an eye on how his character develops in depth and self-awareness as he desperately looks for a way out of the rut.", "A great comedy with a solid message that doesn't hinder the delivery of the comedy.", "Re-watching Groundhog Day yet again was pretty enlightening, actually!", "Cult leader Keith Ranieri was my grade school classmate. What do we call his current prison situation? We call it \"Groundhog day.\" Perhaps millennials aren't familiar with the facts about when and how this term became part of America's cultural lexicon...", "It would be impossible to understand the movie without that casual and inevitable tone delivered by Ramis and Murray. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Murray's performance doesn't only elevate the film to a completely different level but also elevates the work being put in by the rest of the cast.", "With his shifts from smugness to weirdness to some kind of local heroism, Murray controls the picture throughout. But Ramis works ably with his oddly assorted supporting cast.", "Are we all just wasting time squandering eternity? The film doesn't make this accusation lightly. And it takes an outrageous concept, a big premise with a science-fiction spin, to level the idea in terms we accept and understand.", "Ramis and Murray achieve a harmony of wit and wisdom that works so effortlessly on you, on us all, the phrase \"Groundhog Day\" in American vernacular has become a synonym for dj vu.", "Murray, more often than not, is pretty unbearable; but here, playing a man who is unbearable, Murray begins convincingly, amusingly, and gets even more amusing as he metamorphoses.", "Harold Ramis's direction is nothing special, yet there is a beautiful, lip-smacking efficiency in the way that a great idea is touched off and followed to its conclusion.", "When it comes to existential drama comedies about self realizations in a fantastic setting, [it] is right up there with films like \"Her\" and \"Eternal Sunshine.\"", "...the film's forgettable, padded-out nature confirms its place as a promising yet disposable high-concept comedy.", "The day is not a redo; it's a \"one more.\"", "While Murray's deadpan putdowns and dry dismissals of provincial peccadilloes are the comic highlights, Groundhog Day is no supercilious rip of small-town U.S.A.", "Precise and smart and fussed over without feeling fussy.", "The legacy film of director Harold Ramis.", "Director Harold Ramis uses every cinematic trick in the book to keep what is essentially a one-gag movie brimming with life and fresh ideas.", "Groundhog Day is surprisingly inventive."], "rating": ["1", "5/5", "3.5/4", "", "4.5/5", "", "", "", "", "A+", "", "", "", "2/4", "1", "", "8/10", "4/4", "5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Leigh Paatsch", "Richard Propes", "Tasha Robinson", "Mark Jackson", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Danielle Solzman", "Malcolm Johnson", "Calum Marsh", "Rubin Safaya", "Stanley Kauffmann", "Anthony Lane", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "David Nusair", "Kimberly Gadette", "Duane Byrge", "Tim Brayton", "Josh Larsen", "David Parkinson", ""], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Polygon", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Epoch Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Solzy at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">National Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemalogue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New Republic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Doddle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine"], "date": ["September 14, 2020", "September 11, 2020", "September 9, 2020", "August 4, 2020", "November 10, 2019", "July 30, 2019", "June 5, 2018", "June 5, 2018", "February 2, 2018", "February 1, 2018", "January 5, 2018", "January 4, 2018", "May 14, 2015", "February 3, 2015", "February 3, 2015", "February 2, 2015", "June 12, 2014", "March 1, 2014", "February 3, 2014", "February 3, 2014"]}}
