{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Mumble (Elijah Wood), a young emperor penguin, lives in Antarctica. Like others of his kind, he needs to be able to sing to attract a mate, but he has a terrible voice. Instead, Mumble must express himself, and lure a female through his amazing talent for tap-dancing.", "rating": "76", "genre": "Animation/Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "George Miller", "studio": "VillageRoadshowProd.,KennedyMillerProductions", "theater_date": "Nov 17, 2006", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2008", "box_office": "$198.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Steve Martin said it best, 'I'm getting Happy Feet!'", "A surefire Oscar contender, come on and join the fun! All singing! All dancing! All penguins! Come 'on and get happy!", "Miller ensures that a conceit - dancing penguins! - that might have seemed best left to the jokey attachments that clog up email inboxes is supple enough to carry a sardonic parable about the hypocrisy of Western consumers.", "It's very sweet but it's also... really subversive and really weird.", "The visuals in Happy Feet are absolutely amazing.", "Happy Feet will be remembered for its animation breakthroughs and fine voicing.", "I'm the last person in the world to raise a stink about the environment... But that doesn't stop me from hoping that the kids get the message someday, before that March of the Penguins is just a lonely walk into extinction.", "It zigs and zags into a lot of different places you're not expecting. Entertaining throughout. But trippy.", "Miller's labor of love which he'd deliberated over for some time encompasses all the kiddie messages we've come to expect while managing to toss in the rare animation curveball: ecological themes.", "I've been enjoying the Happy Feet fruit snacks for several weeks and am pleased to report that the movie leaves an equally bizarre and artificial, yet strangely addicting, aftertaste.", "", "", "Ultra-cute kid flick has a few scary, emotional moments.", "Parables about xenophobia, tolerance, religion and ecological responsibility are played to cuddly conclusions. Balletic underwater sequences and a jukebox-musical soundtrack spanning Chicago to Grandmaster Flash are spoonfuls of sugar for the medicine.", "George Miller's jubilant, eccentric film makes its CGI penguins vibrant, expressive, even cosmic", "The perfect film for audiences who found fault with March of the Penguins because it was too emotionally taxing and you couldn't dance to it.", "Puts heart and soul back into the good old computer animated, talking animals family film.", "Unfortunately, once the eye candy is firmly established, there's a story here that drags and drags. Then it takes a bit of a leap before it drags some more.", "You should see Happy Feet -- not only because it's stupendous, but also because it features the best dancing you'll see on the screen this year.", "Stands at the very top of the 2006 animated kid's film class."], "rating": ["3.0/4", "", "", "6/10", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "7/10", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "2.5/4", "3/5", "", "", "A-"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Sukhdev Sandhu", "Rachel Wagner", "Frank Wilkins", "John Hayes", "Dustin Rowles", "Dave White", "Brian Marder", "Ron Yamauchi", "Joshua Land", "Heather Huntington", "Jane Boursaw", "Nick Rogers", "Fernando F.
