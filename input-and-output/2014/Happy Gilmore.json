{"metadata": {"synopsis": "All Happy Gilmore (Adam Sandler) has ever wanted is to be a professional hockey player. But he soon discovers he may actually have a talent for playing an entirely different sport: golf. When his grandmother (Frances Bay) learns she is about to lose her home, Happy joins a golf tournament to try and win enough money to buy it for her. With his powerful driving skills and foulmouthed attitude, Happy becomes an unlikely golf hero -- much to the chagrin of the well-mannered golf professionals.", "rating": "61", "genre": "Comedy/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Dennis Dugan", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 15, 2012", "box_office": "$38.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["[Adam] Sandler vascillates between obnoxiousness and boyish charm and winds up winning plenty -- including the majority of audience members -- in the end.", "The comedy is never more than sudden, outsized explosions of violence from the otherwise placid, childlike Happy.
