Professor Brand (Michael Caine), a brilliant NASA physicist, is working on plans to save mankind by transporting Earth's population to a new home via a wormhole. But first, Brand must send former NASA pilot Cooper (Matthew McConaughey) and a team of researchers through the wormhole and across the galaxy to find out which of three planets could be mankind's new home.", "rating": "72", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 45m", "director": "Christopher Nolan", "studio": "LyndaObstProductions,Syncopy", "theater_date": "Nov 7, 2014", "dvd_date": "May 24, 2016", "box_office": "$188.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Nolan reaches for the stars with beautifully composed shots and some mind-bending special effects, but the dime store philosophy of the story never achieves lift off.", "Audiences are sure to lose their suspensions of disbelief over the nearly impenetrable climax.", "...an often insanely ambitious science fiction epic that that remains mesmerizing for most of its (admittedly overlong) running time...", "Scientists will debate, theologians will contemplate, philosophers will wonder, and cinema lovers will bask in the glory of another remarkable Christopher Nolan achievement.", "A big-budget reprise of ideas Nolan has been exploring since the beginning of his career. Not only is it a film about the passage of time, it's also a film about memory.", "None of these characters feel fully-fledged... for a film so rife with schmaltzy musings on the meaning of life, it's alarming how lacking it is in this department.", "Interstellar is not Christopher Nolan's best film but what I will say is that you can't deny his ambition.", "As spectacular as it is flawed.", "Interstellar is not only a grand space adventure worthy of the big screen, it's also a powerfully emotional story about the bond between a father and daughter, and how that love can drive one to attempt the impossible.", "One of the boldest science-fiction movies I've ever seen, both in narrative and visual terms. [Full review in Spanish]", "It was a blockbuster movie-going experience.", "I guess the take away is all you need is love... and morse code?", "Interstellar is, all in all, a very fine science fiction film.", "Interstellar is 120 minutes of good movie stuffed into 170 minutes.", "Interstellar is Nolan at his most humane. It's a good look for him.", "Overall, Interstellar looks nice but ultimately lacks substance. Nolan essentially loses his way by going to space.", "The space voyage is easily one of Nolan's most thought-provoking films yet. It's definitely his most ambitious.", "As far as a masterful visualization of space and an exploration of profound theory, it belongs on a shortlist of must see films which it's comparably akin to... But Nolan's film falls short in other realms, namely the human component.", "It's as grand as it is introspective and as grounded as it is existential. By the end of the nearly three-hour running time - it goes by in a flash - you feel as if you've experienced something that is so rarely captured on film.", "Christopher Nolan more than deserves however much money the studios are willing to keep giving him to make these brainy beautiful blockbusters."], "rating": ["3/5", "5/10", "4/4", "3.5/4", "", "2.5/5", "4/5", "B", "", "9/10", "", "7/10", "", "", "4.2/5", "3.5/5", "B", "3/5", "5/5", "4.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "David Nusair", "Richard Propes", "Siddhant Adlakha", "Stephen A.
