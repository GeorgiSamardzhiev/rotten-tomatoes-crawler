{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the 1960s, four scrappy young men from New Jersey -- Frankie Valli (John Lloyd Young), Bob Gaudio (Erich Bergen), Nick Massi (Michael Lomenda) and Tommy DeVito (Vincent Piazza) -- have the magic sound that propels them from singing under streetlights to singing in spotlights. With songs like \"Sherry,\" \"Big Girls Don't Cry\" and \"Walk Like a Man,\" the quartet finds itself at the top of the charts. However, personal and professional problems threaten to tear the group apart.", "rating": "51", "genre": "Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "2h 12m", "director": "Clint Eastwood", "studio": "MalpasoCompany,GKFilms", "theater_date": "Jun 20, 2014", "dvd_date": "Dec 14, 2015", "box_office": "$47.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Like a coin-operated jukebox that relies on push buttons, stacks of vinyl and electric inner workings to make music, Jersey Boys feels like a mechanical retelling of the popular Broadway show.", "You'll likely be so caught up in the film's catchy music and spirit that you won't much mind occasional liberties and factual errors.", "It made me like the Four Seasons less", "It's Debbie Downer does broadway", "An American Dream story with an authentic period piece feel due to clever filmmaking.", "Whatever you call it, it operates under the same purpose as trying to fit a donut through a keyhole.", "Clint Eastwood's cinematic treatment of musical Jersey Boys plays it safe in nearly every possible regard.", "This well-crafted screen adaptation is not about to let the hits (Sherry, Oh What a Night, Big Girls Don't Cry etc.) do all the heavy lifting, allowing the storytelling to get off lightly.", "Jersey Boys is almost frustrating in a way. The entire time we are aching for the film to wow us. Sadly, it never really does.", "Yes, there's no Eastwood stamp stylistically, but he directs superb performances from the central quartet - and commendably without a whiff of jazz hands.", "A largely dull music industry saga, more TV movie than vibrant celebration of American youth culture.", "The four protagonists, led by Young... simply shine. They create spot-on covers of the original songs and there is no denying their musical nous, harmonious singing voices and energy of their performances.", "Eastwood's Jersey Boys has its flaws... But, there's still the music.", "Young reprises his Broadway role and is adequate, but like the rest of the film it's a performance that never quite provides an emotional investment for the audience.", "The music is great and there are even a few goose-bump moments when Frankie teams up with his writing partner and they try out a new hit. Nevertheless, when the music isn't playing, the film is nothing more than a cursory timeline of the group.", "Sinks as if it had concrete blocks tied to its windpipes.", "The cast makes the most of every musical moment, singing their hearts out while doing a dance line number that the Four Seasons never actually used but should have; its powerful stuff, not just in terms of nostalgia, it's kinda sexy.", "What's interesting is how Eastwood breaks with genre conventions and reinvents the musical as a character study, placing the emotional drama at the forefront, with the songs almost coming as a by-product.", "The most likeable element in the film is not the people but the earworm-quality songs which, even after all this time, sound fresh and irresistibly catchy. You will hum Sherry for hours after the credits roll.", "Large sections of the storytelling feel inert, and some key moments get short shrift."], "rating": ["2/5", "3.0/4", "", "", "3/4", "", "2.5/5", "3/5", "", "4/5", "2/5", "", "", "C", "5/10", "", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Richard Propes", "Avaryl Halley", "Andrew Galdi", "Sarah Knight Adamson", "Angela L.
