[Full Review in Spanish]", "Although shorter than its predecessors in both length and budget, the audience is not short changed. Joe Johnston does a respectable job as director, keeping the pace brisk and the action moving.", "Jurassic Park III exemplifies Hollywood's standard practice of stomping a brilliant concept beyond recognition.", "The script, partially written by the team responsible for Election, is lean, tidy, and best of all, negligible--these screenwriters know better than to let the plot obscure the action, and the result is probably the best of the three Jurassic Park films.", "At its best, it whips itself up into a nice, scary lather, but it shrivels to nothing between the set pieces, in an excess of fog, token bits of talk, and an absence of genuine, elemental awe.", "Imagine my surprise, then, to find that Jurassic Park III not only beats the first JP and its sequel The Lost World into a cocked pith helmet, but also manages to be a perfectly enjoyable monster movie in its own right.", "The latest sequel to Steven Spielberg's clever, scary 1993 original is even less necessary than Spielberg's borderline nonsensical (but still pretty entertaining) 1997 follow-up, The Lost World.", "Despite all its talk of genetic engineering and its deliberately stupid characters, the unintended message of Jurassic Park III is that when it comes to art and entertainment, you can't beat human DNA.", "If velociraptors are so smart, why didn't they chomp up the camera before this cinematic clone got loose and sullied their good name?", "Ptera-fyingly good fun.", "At 140 million years and counting, the venerable Jurassic franchise is definitely showing signs of age.", "It's all competently done, but these newly minted dinos are starting to seem kind of prehistoric.", "Having been through the park on two previous rides, the novelty is now missing and the sublime sense of dread, discovery and excitement of the earlier films is sorely dwindled.", "Jurassic Park III is not a bad film. In fact, for a sequel ending in III it's a pretty good one.", "It's familiar ground, but those set pieces (particularly the pterodactyl attack) are excellent, and only the ending seems a little dashed off.", "And this sequel to a sequel to another sequel happens right after being born to swell the dump of the Hollywood digital scrap.
