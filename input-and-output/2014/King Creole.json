{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Denied his high school diploma because of a schoolyard fight, Danny Fisher (Elvis Presley) is unsure how he's going to support himself and his unemployed father (Dean Jagger).

Things look promising until rival club owner and Danny's former boss, Maxie (Walter Matthau), tries to lure him back with threats and the charms of his sometimes-girlfriend, Ronnie (Carolyn Jones).", "rating": "100", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "Michael Curtiz", "studio": "Paramount", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 25, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One of the few Elvis movies that wasn't a \"Let's make an Elvis movie\" project, King Creole remains the king's personal favorite role -- one I'm inclined to agree with.", "Presley was born to be a performer and his portrayal of Danny in King Creole added more credibility to his acting career.", "As the mostextreme example of a contemporary idol, Mr. Presley is pretty fascinating, and though you may be put off at first by his pale. puffy, bruised-looking babyish face.", "Elvis, young and relatively untamed, in a superior star vehicle from 1958.", "This is arguably Elvis Presley's best film, and certainly his best acting performance.", "King Creole features Elvis Presley's best film performance, a result perhaps of the helming of Michael Curtiz.", "This is the jewel in the King's crown.", "As directed by the versatile Michael Curtiz,this is one of the better Elvis musicals in the early phase of his screen career.", "It does demand to be taken seriously.", "Presley shows himself to be a surprisingly sympathetic and believable actor on occasion.
