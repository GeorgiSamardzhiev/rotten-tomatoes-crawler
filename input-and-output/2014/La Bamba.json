{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Los Angeles teenager Ritchie Valens (Lou Diamond Phillips) becomes an overnight rock 'n' roll success in 1958, thanks to a love ballad called \"Donna\" that he wrote for his girlfriend (Danielle von Zerneck) whose parents didn't want her to date a Latino boy. But as his star rises, Valens has conflicts with his jealous brother, Bob (Esai Morales), and becomes haunted by a recurring nightmare of a plane crash just as he begins his first national tour alongside Buddy Holly (Marshall Crenshaw).", "rating": "91", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Luis Valdez", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation,NewVisionsPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 8, 2014", "box_office": "$52.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An energetic picture filled with light and music, and Lou Diamond Phillips is an easygoing charismatic presence as Ritchie Valens, so sweet-hearted he's almost angelic.", "Valdez's simple-yet-elegant visual style is on target and his script uses the elements of Valens' life to the fullest, almost creating an underlying poetic rhythm to the film.", "You can have a perfectly pleasant time at \"La Bamba\" but you come out still hungry to understand the forces that shaped [Ritchie Valens].", "The movie works surprisingly for reasons that have nothing to do with Valens` small list of hits. La Bamba is really just a very good family story about a pushy mother proud of one son, derisive of another.", "As Valens, Lou Diamond Phillips has a sweetness and sincerity that in no way diminish the toughness of his onstage persona. The role is blandly written, but Mr. Phillips gives Valens backbone.", "How many films can be squeezed out of this formula?", "It's easy to forgive the thudding omens and ironies, since they appear in such a life-affirming context. The purpose of La Bamba is not to mourn Valens's death but to celebrate his life, with special attention to the great joy he found in music.", "With a convincing performance by newcomer Phillips -- and the exhilarating Latin rockers Los Lobos, who bring Valens's sound back to life -- La Bamba is a refreshing blast from the past.", "Melodrama is inherently a broad genre -- one that projects inner psychological conflicts onto towering outside forces -- and in the overall thrust of his film, Valdez excels in conveying a world dominated by a gigantic, impersonal power.", "Valens, meanwhile, is played with likeable charm and refreshing innocence by relative newcomer Lou Diamond Phillips. Among the large supporting cast, Rosana De Soto stands out as Ritchie's proud and loving mother.", "La Bamba has a lot going for it besides its compelling teen myth. As might have been predicted, the music is terrific.", "The actors are mostly appealing and Valens's 50s hits (dubbed in by Los Lobos) are given their energetic due.", "Most pop biopics are tepid affairs, but the same cannot be said for director Luis Valdez's engrossing re-creation of Ritchie Valens's short life.", "A perfectly respectable biopic.", "La Bamba is a well-versed depiction of Ritchie Valens' life, and it is evident a tremendous amount of care was put into the production of this film.", "A strong statement about the fleeting, fragility of life, and the bond between brothers.", "This is a movie about music and it is the Valens sound, a unique blending of Latin rhythm and rock beat, that prevents La Bamba from being just another example of Hollywood hero worship.", "Sweet, sad rock-idol story for mature teens.", "An enjoyable if slightly innocuous biopic based on the brief life and short-lived fame of teen rock'n'roll idol Richie Valens.", "La Bamba is engrossing throughout and boasts numerous fine performances."], "rating": ["4/5", "4/4", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "3/5", "3/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Christopher Lloyd", "Juan Carlos Coto", "Sheila Benson", "Gene Siskel", "Janet Maslin", "Richard Corliss", "David Sterritt", "Nicholas Jennings", "Dave Kehr", "Jack Garner", "Jay Boyar", "Pat Graham", "John Marriott", "William Thomas", "Bree Duwyn", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Cathy Burke", "Teresa Talerico", "Nigel Floyd", "Variety Staff"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Yap", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Maclean&#39;s Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gannett News Service", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Inquiry", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">United Press International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety"], "date": ["May 18, 2020", "March 24, 2020", "March 24, 2020", "March 24, 2020", "March 24, 2020", "March 24, 2020", "March 24, 2020", "March 24, 2020", "March 24, 2020", "March 24, 2020", "March 24, 2020", "March 24, 2020", "March 24, 2020", "March 24, 2020", "January 26, 2020", "January 2, 2017", "November 8, 2016", "January 1, 2011", "July 7, 2010", "March 26, 2009"]}}
