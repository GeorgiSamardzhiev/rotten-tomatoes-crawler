{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this documentary, homosexual filmmaker Arthur Dong interviews men who were imprisoned for slaying gays. Dong, who was physically attacked because of his own sexuality in the 1970s, tries to ascertain the convicts' motives -- why they would commit such heinous crimes. Some prisoners express remorse for their acts of violence, while others believe the murders they committed were justified. The interviewees include a U.S. military officer, a devout Christian and a petty thief.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Documentary/Musical & Performing Arts/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 20m", "director": "Arthur Dong", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 14, 2005", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Disturbing, unflinching and brilliant.", "The almost clinical restraint of Dong's Sundance and Berlin Film Festival award-winner only enhances its staggering emotional impact.", "The chill and fear it generates are more genuine than the 1989 James Bond film its name evokes.", "Licensed to Kill is a real achievement, especially since Dong didn't lose his perspective -- he hates the crime, but not the criminals, and he pins the blame where it belongs.", "Offering a harrowing and disturbing look at homophobia and anti-gay violence, Dong's courageous docu, winner of 2 major awards at the 1997 Sundance Fest, is an intelligent exploration of sexual prejudice and hatred in contemporay American society.", "A tough and thought-provoking.", "Nothing you've heard about the plague of violence against gay men will lessen the shock value of this chilling look at the real face of evil.", "It's a simple idea for a film: Do interviews with people in prison who have killed gays and ask them to explain why they did it, but the riveting result is far from simple.", "Documentaries need energy, or they can become as dry as reading a dictionary.
