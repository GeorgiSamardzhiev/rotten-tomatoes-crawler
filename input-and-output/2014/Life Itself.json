Moments of frustration and pain are included but ultimately the doc is a wake for the late film critic. Stories are shared, secrets are told and a life is celebrated.", "Life Itself is a reminder, I suppose, that when the human spirit lives on we never really lose our voice.", "A heartfelt exploration of a man who opened film up for the world.", "Life Itself is not a film of mourning, it is a film of celebration. It is not a lionization, it is an exploration. But most importantly I think it is a film that Roger would be proud of.", "I loved this movie... partly because I loved Roger.", "[Roger Ebert's] determination is heart-wrenching... The great difficulty for James is in reconciling these powerful sequences with the more traditional elements of a narrative documentary.", "ife Itself left me inspired, as I'm sure it did every single person in the theater.", "My only complaint about the expansive, emotional documentary \"Life Itself,\" about legendary film critic Roger Ebert, is that you really can't complain about it.", "A celebration of the life of the most important film critic of the past 50 years, a man of the people as well as a film connoisseur.", "...a revelation, an approach to the life of a fascinating man we only knew through his work. [Full review in Spanish]", "While Life Itself falls more into the category of \"posthumous celebration\" than \"in-depth documentary,\" it does an excellent job of painting a visual portrait of a man who was often polarizing, yet almost universally admired.", "In [Steve] James' affectionate telling, Ebert's life, itself, was bountiful indeed.", "Life Itself is the kind of film that reminds you why you love the movies.", "This is an extraordinary biopic not just because it is about an extraordinary life but because it advocates living - and dying - with candor and grace.", "Roger Ebert was an unusual outlier in the world of critics, and Life Itself is an honorable testament to how he shaped the world of cinema as we know it today.", "No film in the festival is as critic-friendly; watching it, I finally understood how football players must feel about 'Brian's Song'.", "[A] succinct and often hilarious retelling of a life well lived.", "Well, Roger, you made it. You're in a movie.", "My generation will never know a film critic like Roger Ebert again. He brought his noble trade to the people and made us all film critics by celebrating his love of movies at a level we could all understand.", "Steve James' wonderful documentary invites your emotional, intellectual and political engagements, to share Ebert's own commitment, his excitement about movies, as a part and form of life itself."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "4.0/4", "A", "3.5/4", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "3/4", "", "", "B+", "", "4/5", "5/5", "A", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "Matthew Lucas", "Rachel Wagner", "Craig Williams", "Morgan Rojas", "Asia Frey", "Louis Proyect", "Sebastian Zavala Kahn", "Josh Terry", "Lisa Jensen", "Alex Heeney", "Lisa Rosman", "Raffi Asdourian", "Jason Bailey", "J.
