{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this tense Alfred Hitchcock thriller, based on a John Steinbeck novella, American and British civilians who have survived the sinking of their ship by a German submarine struggle to reach land in a crowded lifeboat. When a German officer (Walter Slezak) is rescued from the water, the group allows him to board, but his presence only increases the tensions on the boat. Soon treachery ensues, and the population of the vessel gradually decreases as conflicts come to a head.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "Alfred Hitchcock", "studio": "20thCenturyFox", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["We came away with the very definite impression it was quite good as entertainment, but still does not go on the list of pictures which are milestones in the career of the Negro in motion pictures.", "An early and neglected masterwork of Alfred Hitchcock's, Lifeboat still holds water, and features a not to miss performance from the throaty and rapacious Tallulah Bankhead.", "Tallulah Bankhead returns to the world of cinema with an admirable performance in a difficult role.
