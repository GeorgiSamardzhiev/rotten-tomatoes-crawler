{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Nine intertwined stories examine the complexities of the one emotion that connects us all: love. Among the characters explored are David (Hugh Grant), the handsome newly elected British prime minister who falls for a young junior staffer (Martine McCutcheon), Sarah (Laura Linney), a graphic designer whose devotion to her mentally ill brother complicates her love life, and Harry (Alan Rickman), a married man tempted by his attractive new secretary.", "rating": "64", "genre": "Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "2h 15m", "director": "Richard Curtis", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "Nov 26, 2003", "dvd_date": "Dec 1, 2015", "box_office": "$59.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A load of sickeningly twee nonsense inflated, bizarrely, into some kind of totemic Christmas film that only humbugs suggest might not just be rubbish.", "It's almost a shock to see such a well constructed and beautifully acted scene (Emma Thompson opening her present) amid the rest of this film's more mainstream machinations.", "A collection of touching sketches that are frequently sentimental yet thoroughly grand.", "It's a tremendous romantic comedy that far outshines most American comedies.", "Curtis pulls off a spectacular feat of screenwriting, expertly defining 16 principal characters and their relationships, providing each one with a beginning, middle, and end, and making us care about what happens to all of them.", "There's so much right and yummy about this multi-tiered plum cake of a romantic comedy.", "The film exhibits a real soft spot for sexual predators, while also promoting the notion that Christmas is the perfect time to publicly dump your love on the near-stranger you're tenderly stalking.", "Now, though, Curtis, England's most successful comic screenwriter, has shown that when it comes to Hollywood pap, the English can teach Hollywood a treacly trick or two.", "This plum pudding of a romantic comedy is rich with delicious moments.", "Love Actually isn't in love with anyone except itself: it's like watching a practised lounge lizard go through his repertoire.", "Forget about stiff upper lips. Though very British, this irresistible ensemble comedy will easily coax full-sized grins of enjoyment from viewers.", "If you feel yourself glowing after Love Actually, you might be suffering from sugar shock.", "Out of the cacophony of other, newly minted love affairs that promise eternal love forever and ever, theirs stand out like a winter fern among hothouse roses, adding a much-needed zest to the bouquet.", "Love Actually provides enough happy endings to make the audience forget that romance and Christmas miracles don't always work out.", "The tagline for Love Actually is \"The Ultimate Romantic Comedy.\" Perhaps. But not in the sense the producers intended.", "[T]here's more authentic sentiment in a Hallmark card than in the entire movie.", "It is not only the best romantic comedy in quite a long time, it is every romantic comedy in quite a long time, baked into a melange and made gargantuan. I left smiling like a huge imbecile.", "A polished, fluid production with impeccable technical credits and a winning soundtrack, Love Actually is the very definition of entertainment and is guaranteed to bring joy to the world this Christmas.", "As far as frothy, feelgood stuff goes, Love Actually works on most levels.", "[E]ven the best eggnogs can turn sour, and the mistaken addition of paprika in place of nutmeg can transform what should be a treat into something see."], "rating": ["2/5", "3/5", "9/10", "3.5/4", "", "4.5/5", "1.5/5", "", "", "", "", "2/4", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "3/5", "C-"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Tony Black", "PJ Nabarro", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Kyle Smith", "Subhash K Jha", "Daniel Barnes", "Cosmo Landesman", "Brian D.
