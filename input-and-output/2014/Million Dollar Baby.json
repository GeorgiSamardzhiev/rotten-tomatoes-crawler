{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Frankie Dunn (Clint Eastwood) is a veteran Los Angeles boxing trainer who keeps almost everyone at arm's length, except his old friend and associate Eddie \"Scrap Iron\" Dupris (Morgan Freeman). When Maggie Fitzgerald (Hilary Swank) arrives in Frankie's gym seeking his expertise, he is reluctant to train the young woman, a transplant from working-class Missouri. Eventually, he relents, and the two form a close bond that will irrevocably change them both.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 12m", "director": "Clint Eastwood", "studio": "MalpasoCompany", "theater_date": "Dec 15, 2004", "dvd_date": "Jan 14, 2016", "box_office": "$100.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The characters Eastwood plays are not answerable to anyone, except themselves. As long as they pull a long face, furrow their brows and look pained after the fact, they are permitted to commit any number of crimes.", "Million Dollar Baby boasts wonderful acting and character writing, but a frustrating treatment of themes within a plot adapted from two short stories.", "As the film draws to its powerhouse close, gentle piano music by Eastwood himself gives this haunting tragedy an even higher level of poignancy.", "Fakes you out, then knocks you flat with a right hook to the heart.", "Million Dollar Baby is aesthetically and emotionally a dark movie that ultimately falls short because every rough edge is softened by a clich\u00e9. Here, Eastwood throws a handful of sugar in for good measure, too.", "Turning the conventions of the boxing movie inside out, this sees Eastwood - as actor and director - at the top of his game.", "A one-man shop who even composed the muted score for his movie, Eastwood reminds us how films are best created, like Maggie's destiny in the ring, with one's own hands.", "Eastwood seductively draws the viewer into the world of three lonely, bruised people, to the point where the viewer becomes wholly immersed in them and their fates.", "The film does obliquely posit a new model of womanhood, one about risking the all-important beauty for a larger mission. But more than Maggie, the show actually belongs to the guilt-ridden Frankie...", "It's too bad it is nihilism dressed up as compassion.", "...[Clint] Eastwood teaches us his journey to achieve [respect] with modesty. [Full Review in Spanish]", "In Million Dollar Baby, Eastwood makes us believe both that [the] relationship is completely surprising and wholly a product of fate.", "[It's] about so much more than boxing. It's about redemption, risk-taking, the search for family and God, the pursuit of a dream, a soul-shattering moral dilemma and the father-daughter relationship that develops between Frankie and Maggie.", "As sappy and Lifetime-y as all this sounds, Eastwood's skill with the performers keeps Million Dollar Baby afloat.", "What moves you so powerfully at the end is not just a shattering tale of two old guys and a female boxer but, in our new millennium, a 74-year-old man's ability to tell it so powerfully without (apparently) the melancholy business of movies laying a glove", "Its very conventionality is what makes it so compelling; we've seen this before, but it still gets us every time.", "Always one of America's most undervalued directors, Clint Eastwood is proving himself the American cinema's national treasure in the third act of his career.", "A heartfelt, creditable picture.", "I don't think it's his masterpiece, but it's a big, beautiful, sad film with unforgettable performances.", "Anyone who doesn't believe that Clint Eastwood is one of the best film-makers in America ought to see Million Dollar Baby."], "rating": ["", "3/5", "1", "4/4", "3/5", "5/5", "", "", "3/4", "", "3/5", "", "4/4", "", "4/4", "", "", "3/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Alix Turner", "Mike Massie", "Matthew Lucas", "Kaleem Aftab", "Sky Staff", "Brian Miller", "Michael Dwyer", "Namrata Joshi", "Sr. Rose Pacatte", "Paula Arantzazu Ruiz", "Bill O&#39;Driscoll", "Barbara Vancheri", "Bradley Steinbacher", "Jeff Simon", "Dorothy Woodend", "Sean Axmaker", "Peter Bradshaw", "Paul Byrnes", "Derek Malcolm"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Ready Steady Cut", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The List", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sky Cinema", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Irish Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Outlook", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sister Rose at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sensacine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Pittsburgh City Paper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Stranger (Seattle, WA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Buffalo News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Tyee (British Columbia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seanax.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sydney Morning Herald", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard"], "date": ["February 15, 2021", "February 2, 2021", "November 7, 2020", "June 5, 2019", "April 23, 2019", "February 21, 2019", "February 19, 2019", "February 19, 2019", "January 8, 2019", "March 1, 2018", "February 27, 2018", "February 27, 2018", "February 27, 2018", "February 27, 2018", "February 27, 2018", "August 24, 2017", "March 16, 2017", "February 27, 2015", "February 27, 2015", "February 27, 2015"]}}
