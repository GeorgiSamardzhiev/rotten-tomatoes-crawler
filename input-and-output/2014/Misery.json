{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After a serious car crash, novelist Paul Sheldon (James Caan) is rescued by former nurse Annie Wilkes (Kathy Bates), who claims to be his biggest fan. Annie brings him to her remote cabin to recover, where her obsession takes a dark turn when she discovers Sheldon is killing off her favorite character from his novels. As Sheldon devises plans for escape, Annie grows increasingly controlling, even violent, as she forces the author to shape his writing to suit her twisted fantasies.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Drama/Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Rob Reiner", "studio": "CastleRockEntertainment,NelsonEntertainment", "theater_date": "Nov 30, 1990", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2016", "box_office": "$54.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One of those rare films capable of spending the entire running time focusing on the cat-and-mouse suspense between a superbly cinematic duo, without ever slowing down.", "All the psychological, emotional, and visceral angles of the horror are anchored to the performances of James Caan and Kathy Bates.", "Reiner's tense adaptation of Stephen King's first satisfying screen yarn in years is superbly paced, chock full of devilish plot twists and capable of lifting audiences inches off their seats.", "Reiner's film is an absolutely harrowing tale of fandom gone wrong and the damage that it can cause the artist.", "There's no evil, no zombies, no cursed MacGuffins, no serial killers-just a deranged lonely person and a self-regarding jerk. Together, they make terror.", "..a prescient prediction of the way fanboy culture would come to influence the creative process.", "The film hasn't any depth to speak of, but is consistently shrewd enough not to go totally obvious ways. And the audacity in casting Kathy Bates as the dotty fan pays considerable dividends.", "Among other things, Misery emerges as a great picture of fan obsession, and of that curious mix of hero-worship and hero-bashing personified in supermarket tabloids and trash TV.", "Bates turns Wilkes into the nastiest nurse to reach the screen since Louise Fletcher tormented Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.", "Caan and Bates capture the movie's roguish spirit perfectly.", "This all would have been perfect for a half-hour TV show or one of those horror anthology films. As it is, even the resourceful Reiner and Goldman are hard put to keep things going until the inevitable final clash.", "Misery should be a big hit. It deserves to be.", "It's Kathy Bates' Oscar-winning turn as a smiling psychopath that still provides the film's cold, cold heart and makes for one of cinema's greatest, friendliest, monsters.", "Unfortunately, what could have been a seamless psychological thriller is interrupted by violence that's as gratuitous as it is sadistic.", "Like any good work of popular culture, Rob Reiner's film of Stephen King's best-selling book Misery functions on more than one level.", "A quality film of suspense and manipulation.", "Like Stand By Me, Misery can't help but broaden the audience for movies based on Stephen King's work.", "Director Rob Reiner creates an atmosphere of tense horror wrapped around rich dialogue (\"Cockadoodie dirty birdie!\"), and in the process, he gets sterling performances from Caan and Bates.", "Kathy Bates brilliantly portrays Annie as someone with absolutely no sense of her own monstrosity.", "Popular moviemaking -- elegantly economical, artlessly artful -- doesn't get much better than this."], "rating": ["9/10", "5/5", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "4/4", "3/4", "3/4", "", "", "5/5", "", "3/4", "4/5", "4.5/5", "A", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "C.H.
