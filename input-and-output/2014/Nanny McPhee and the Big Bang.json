But like McPhee herself, it's hard not to like this cinematic hug - warts and all.", "The nursery rhyme names, lashings of ginger beer and a motorbike and sidecar trip to London ... would have liked it will have the killjoys claiming the film is seasoned to American taste but I found it utterly charming.", "The magic is gone.", "It's possible that it could come off as a little surprising, despite its predictable nature, if you haven't seen the first film. But even then, I think it would be rather obvious that the charm is missing.", "", "", "", "An unfunny nanny who outstays her welcome.", "Thompson brings a sly wit to some scenes, and her absence is felt when she leaves the screen time to the bickering children.", "Nanny McPhee Returns establishes standard class differences between the country cousins and the city cousins -- even as both sets of children are in need of retraining by the daunting Nanny McPhee (Emma Thompson).", "Almost defiantly old-fashioned.
