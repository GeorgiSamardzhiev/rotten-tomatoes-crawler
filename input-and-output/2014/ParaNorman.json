{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Young Norman Babcock (Kodi Smit-McPhee) has the ability to speak with the dead -- and he often prefers their company to that of the living. Norman receives word from his strange Uncle Prenderghast (John Goodman) that a centuries-old witch's curse on their town is real and about to come true -- and that only Norman can stop it. When zombies rise from their graves, Norman must summon all his courage and compassion and push his paranormal abilities to the limit to save his fellow townspeople.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Animation/Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "Chris Butler, Sam Fell", "studio": "Laika", "theater_date": "Aug 17, 2012", "dvd_date": "Oct 19, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Every child should see it.", "Gorgeous animation enhances a touching story about death and learning to accept what you don't understand.", "Jon Brion's original score is a perfect companion for the film with a sublime mixture of melancholy and madness along the way.", "Scares blend with a strange gallows humor to create a fantastic movie that will get you as pumped up as it gets your kids.", "The film's pleasures are in its spooky visuals, amusingly created characters and its indulgence in the cartoonishly macabre.", "[ParaNorman]... will entertain your whole family with its big, sweet, creepy heart.", "The puppetry is impressive-the ghosts and zombies are a feast for the eyes-and the stop-motion is fluid.", "My favorite part about this movie aside from the animation is this message... [that] even if we feel justified in our anger if we allow hate to take over our lives then then we become what we hate.", "The movie is full of surprises, not the least of which is what those surprises actually are.", "Whether or not you have children in your life, Paranorman deserves a spot on your Halloween watch list this year.", "Regardless of its flaws, the film is a sweet, funny take on horror films that turns many of the tropes of the genre on its head.", "It often feels as if it caters more to adults than kids, but I think the entire family can enjoy this one as long as your kids aren't too squeamish.", "Expresses the message of the film in an audibly violent and impassioned way, displaying a level of bravery rarely seen in children's cinema.", "\"ParaNorman\" spikes the adventure with truly sad and sobering moments dealing with real-life issues like bullying, death and the mob mentality.", "An original feature about tolerance and understanding that just happens to have ghosts, zombies, a vengeful witch, and some of the most gorgeous stop-motion work I've seen in a while.", "It's very, very. It's nice to see a stop motion film.", "ParaNorman is just plain fun.", "ParaNorman is a fun and rather sweet film which will subtly delight pop culturists and which asks some gentle questions about human nature.", "By placing weighty, real world lessons aimed at kids in this specific cinematic world, the gloominess is only intensified.", "Brings with it a very relevant and important moral that bears pondering by fans."], "rating": ["4/4", "4/5", "3.0/4", "A", "", "", "", "9/10", "B", "", "7/10", "8/10", "3/5", "3/4", "", "", "4/5", "3/5", "2/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Matthew Rozsa", "Trace Thurman", "Richard Propes", "Brent McKnight", "Al Hoff", "Leslie Combemale", "Naila Scargill", "Rachel Wagner", "Abbie Bernstein", "Kt Schaefer", "Johnny Gayzmonic", "Jennifer Heaton", "Joseph Walsh", "Brandy McDonnell", "Charles Webb", "Andre Meadows", "Yasmin Shehab", "Krystal Sim", "J.
