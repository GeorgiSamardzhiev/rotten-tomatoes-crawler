When their boat is attacked, they wash up in Japanese-occupied Sumatra and end up in a POW camp. Conditions there are grim, with prisoners brutally punished for minor violations. But the captives soon decide to form a singing group that just may lift these very different women out of misery.", "rating": "45", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Bruce Beresford", "studio": "VillageRoadshowEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 1, 2013", "box_office": "$1.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Never lifts off to anywhere that's profound or moving or interesting", "", "A large cast of gifted actress, including Glenn Close and Frances McDormand, is largely wasted in Beresford's honroable but failed effort to pay tribute to a group of disparate women held captive by the Japanese in WWII.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "A triumphant celebration of the human spirit in the face of suffering.", "", "The movie is an anecdote, not a story.", "Even with its grueling pageant of torture and abuse at the hands of monstrously inhuman Japanese officers, Road never reaches the heart.", "", "", "", "", ""], "rating": ["C", "C+", "C", "3/5", "B", "2/5", "3/5", "2/4", "2/5", "B", "2.5/4", "", "7", "2/4", "1.5/4", "3/4", "3.5/4", "3/4", "2.5/4", "7/10"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Murtada Elfadl", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Emanuel Levy", "Susan Granger", "Robin Clifford", "Emanuel Levy", "Carol Cling", "Jim Shelby", "Philip Martin", "Nick Davis", "", "Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat", "Brian Webster", "Roger Ebert", "Susan Wloszczyna", "Madeleine Williams", "James Berardinelli", "Susan Stark", "Steve Rhodes", "Jack Garner"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sundays with Cate", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">www.susangranger.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reeling Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Las Vegas Review-Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Palo Alto Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Nick&#39;s Flick Picks", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Globe and Mail", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spirituality &amp; Practice", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Apollo Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Sun-Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">USA Today", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinematter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ReelViews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Detroit News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Internet Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rochester Democrat and Chronicle"], "date": ["May 1, 2020", "September 7, 2011", "June 21, 2007", "December 26, 2006", "April 9, 2005", "December 18, 2004", "May 14, 2004", "May 20, 2003", "January 31, 2003", "January 10, 2003", "April 12, 2002", "February 26, 2002", "March 21, 2001", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000", "January 1, 2000"]}}
