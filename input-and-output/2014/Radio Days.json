{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A middle-aged man looks back on his childhood in Rockaway, N.Y., in a series of vignettes focused on the golden days of radio. Joe (Woody Allen), who narrates, is portrayed as a teenager in the film by Seth Green. Eccentric relatives and radio personalities inhabit various stories, including an unlucky aunt (Dianne Wiest), a cigarette girl (Mia Farrow) with career ambitions, and two burglars with excellent timing. Young Joe involves his friends in a scam to earn a decoder ring.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Woody Allen", "studio": "OrionPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 8, 2016", "box_office": "$11.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Allen's film is both tribute and still relevant criticism, aching for times gone by while acknowledging that this medium of easy entertainment comes with a price.", "A light, complacent, and evocative comedy whose vision leaves us with a sweet aftertaste.
