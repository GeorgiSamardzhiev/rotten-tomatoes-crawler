{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When unemployed ex-marine Michael Williams (Nicolas Cage) stumbles into a bar in Red Rock, Wyo., the owner, Wayne (J.T.

Michael plays along, taking half the money up front, then tells Suzanne what her husband is planning. She seduces Michael and proposes that he kill her husband instead. While he weighs his options, the real killer (Dennis Hopper) turns up looking for his money.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "John Dahl", "studio": "RedRockFilms,PolyGramFilmedEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 27, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's well worth tracking down, wherever you can find it. For it has the kind of tension and energy -- maybe even a touch of delirium -- that is only a memory in most of today's big studio movies.", "The cast is terrific, with Walsh at his most deliciously amoral.", "A wry thriller with a keen edge.", "One of the most successful entries in the crowded ranks of early '90s neo-noir thrillers.", "A rather ho-hum if watchable neo-noir, though it's been treated in some quarters as something special.", "Great fun.", "It's a brilliant noir movie that seems to understand the inner workings of film noir, rather than just paying tribute to it.", "A forceful, witty film noir played almost straight.", "John Dahl's second feature is a quirky, low-budget \"Western noir,\" baosting a fresh narrative angle and a quintessentially indie cast, including Nicolas Cage (before he became a star), J.T. Walsh, and the ubiquitous enfant terrible Dennis Hopper", "[A] well-played, highly entertaining and playfully ingenious thriller.", "With J.T. Walsh, Dennis Hopper, and Lara Flynn Boyle in your desert thriller, it's hard to go wrong, and in his riveting sophomore feature, John Dahl rarely gets tripped up.", "", "", "", "", "A great, twisty noir that plants a Jim Thompson plot in the American Southwest.", "A great example of western film noir from director John Dahl, a modern day master of these types of films.", "It should never have fallen through the cracks. This clever little film is a real find.", "Red Rock West is a tasty film noir with a western twang to it and enough twists to keep hardened crime buffs on their toes. Even better than the deliciously complicated plot are the performances of a cast enjoying themselves with the ripe material.", "As Red Rock West reached its conclusion, I was completely caught up in its plot -- and unsure of what would happen next. That's rare in a thriller, and it's a tribute to the ingenuity, skill and craft of the people on both sides of the camera."], "rating": ["", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "3.5/4", "5/5", "B+", "", "4/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4.5/5", "", "4.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Schickel", "", "Leonard Klady", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Cole Smithey", "Jeffrey M.
