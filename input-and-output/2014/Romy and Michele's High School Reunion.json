{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Ten years after their high school graduation, Romy (Mira Sorvino) and Michele (Lisa Kudrow) haven't exactly accomplished everything that they set out to do. Despite their strong friendship, their personal and professional lives are still lacking. When they hear of their upcoming high school reunion, they take it as an opportunity to show their classmates how much they've changed -- first by trying to reform themselves, then by creating a lie that eventually spins out of control.", "rating": "73", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 31m", "director": "David Mirkin", "studio": "TouchstonePictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 10, 2015", "box_office": "$29.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The good-natured feel of these air-headed characters makes for a genuinely fun time.", "Call it Bill and Ted with attitude, or a toothless Clueless: either way, the film uses up its best lines in the first 40 minutes, and only comes to life whenever the splendidly grouchy Janeane Garofalo is on screen.", "As she did in Mighty Aphrodite, Sorvino rises above knackered material that seems set on patronising her character.", "Perpetually uneven but affable enough...", "If you're in the mood for fluffy fun, it is likely to make you laugh. The flick holds special charms for moviegoers who, like me, were not members of their high school \"in\" crowd.", "It's a fun, feel good movie about being true to yourself that celebrates how friendship can be the most powerful love a person can hope to find.", "Writer Robin Schiff, adapting her own play, is terrific at permitting her protagonists to drive the film rather than place them into a film she's already worked out.", "Silly comedy about superficial pals has lots of profanity.", "Robin Schiff's screenplay is filled with memorable zings (\"You're just as cute as me,\" Michele assures Romy. \"In some cultures, maybe even cuter.\"), Sorvino and Kudrow are an irresistible team, and Janeane Garofalo shows up to steal scenes with aplomb.", "Kudrow and Sorvino are fun to watch, Garafalo is deliciously acerbic, and the whole Valley Girl reunion thing is a stroke of light-and-fluffy genius.", "", "", "", "", "", "", "I just can't resist stories about misfits, even as slight and forgettable as this one.", "It's not stupid.
