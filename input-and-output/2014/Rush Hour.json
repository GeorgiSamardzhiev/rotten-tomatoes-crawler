{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When a Chinese diplomat's daughter is kidnapped in Los Angeles, he calls in Hong Kong Detective Inspector Lee (Jackie Chan) to assist the FBI with the case. But the FBI doesn't want anything to do with Lee, and they dump him off on the LAPD, who assign wisecracking Detective James Carter (Chris Tucker) to watch over him. Although Lee and Carter can't stand each other, they choose to work together to solve the case on their own when they figure out they've been ditched by both the FBI and police.", "rating": "61", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Brett Ratner", "studio": "NewLineCinema,RogerBirnbaumProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 18, 2008", "box_office": "$141.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Chan plays his typical good guy, scripted to be serious in the right places yet silly at others, embodying the perfect, composed straight man to Tucker's relentless joker.", "A brief sequence where he weaves between tour bus, truck and camper van views like a kung-fu version of Singin' In The Rain.
