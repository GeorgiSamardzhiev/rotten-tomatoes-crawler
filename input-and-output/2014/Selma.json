{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Although the Civil Rights Act of 1964 legally desegregated the South, discrimination was still rampant in certain areas, making it very difficult for blacks to register to vote. In 1965, an Alabama city became the battleground in the fight for suffrage. Despite violent opposition, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (David Oyelowo) and his followers pressed forward on an epic march from Selma to Montgomery, and their efforts culminated in President Lyndon Johnson signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965.", "rating": "99", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 8m", "director": "Ava DuVernay", "studio": "PlanBEntertainment,HarpoFilms,CloudEight", "theater_date": "Jan 9, 2015", "dvd_date": "May 24, 2016", "box_office": "$52.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A historical document, but so alive and timely, it is essential viewing almost fifty years after King's assassination.", "Selma is the best kind of biopic (if you can even call it that).", "One of the most effective, well-crafted historical biopics that I've ever seen... giving us a moment in history that feels immediately familiar to the moment we are currently living in.", "Wisely uses affective montages, orchestral music, tight pacing, and award-worthy acting to supplement the intense recreations of iconic undertakings.", "Truly a film that must be seen by today's youth so that we can keep Selma and Ferguson from happening in the future.", "Selma is worthy of my highest recommendation. Hopefully like me, you'll clap once the end credits roll.", "The acting is exquisite, and DuVernay directs with a sure and confident hand. It's not only the story of Martin Luther King Jr.; it's the story of the American People.", "Leaves audiences moved and shaken; this is a movie that will resonate and be remembered for a very, very long time.", "In bringing together the personal, the political, and the historic, DuVernay has crafted a film that will be remembered and studied for years to come.", "...offering not only a superbly-realized presentation of a particular series of events, but also a sense of what it meant to live through the historical period in question.", "It's the weight of history that gives Selma so much emotional heft.", "...[I]n zooming in on one moment, director DuVernay and writer Paul Webb really force us to live in the trial by fire that was the American South in 1965.", "As director, DuVernay employs a style of storytelling... that makes it possible for audiences to find the film engrossing, entertaining, and educational.", "Selma is spectacularly staged, impressively acted and narratively satisfying. But it is also something much, much more and we need much, much more like it.", "Selma tells a great story about a triumphant moment in civil rights history and the losses it took to get that win, but it doesn't nostalgically let us forget that this moment is just a chapter break in a longer war that still rages on today.", "There is nothing saccharine about Selma. DuVernay does justice to the illustrious subject matter... and that's no mean feat.", "A very satisfying picture.", "In a time where dedicated activists are speaking their own truths to leaders who are often even less responsive, movies such as Selma feel more essential than ever.", "Selma's cultural significance is critical and will inevitably permeate all conversations about the film. As a reviewer, I must stress that its cinematic value speaks for itself, even when you swipe away the context of today's struggles.", "Selma serves as a pointed and poignant riposte to our current historical moment. It's an important film about an important story. It deserves to be seen, shared, discussed, and, like the events it depicts, never forgotten."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "9/10", "", "1", "3.5/4", "4.5/5", "A", "A", "", "8/10", "", "", "5/5", "A", "7.5/10", "4/5", "A", "", "8/10", "A"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Nicole Ackman", "Nijla Mu&#39;min", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Allen Almachar", "Brent McKnight", "Chris McCoy", "Sarah Boslaugh", "David Harris", "Debbie Holloway", "Leslie Combemale", "Ryan Syrek", "Dominic Griffin", "Danielle Davenport", "Rachel Wagner", "Andrea Thompson", "Bernard Boo", "Zaki Hasan"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Next Best Picture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bitch Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Confessions From A Geek Mind", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheArtsStl", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Narrative Muse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Reader (Omaha, NE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spool", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Way Too Indie", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Zaki&#39;s Corner"], "date": ["February 2, 2021", "January 30, 2021", "January 22, 2021", "December 4, 2020", "September 22, 2020", "July 17, 2020", "July 16, 2020", "July 7, 2020", "January 9, 2020", "December 30, 2019", "November 27, 2019", "October 21, 2019", "August 2, 2019", "July 30, 2019", "July 16, 2019", "May 17, 2019", "May 2, 2019", "April 29, 2019", "March 20, 2019", "February 16, 2019"]}}
