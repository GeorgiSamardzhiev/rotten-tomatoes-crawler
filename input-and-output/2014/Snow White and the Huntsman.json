Unfortunately that's not the case.", "Casting is one of the shortcomings of Snow White and the Huntsman.", "The biggest disappointment is its mediocrity, as it could have been the ultimate dark retelling of the classic fairy tale.", "Sanders recaptures the story's dark roots and delivers a compelling and epic adventure that is a definite bright spot in a surprisingly dull summer movie season.", "A film that succeeds somewhat by not trying to be anything it's not.", "What you take away from this dark film, filled with several twisted characters and twisty turns, is a great deal of nicely-crafted atmosphere, and a terrific performance from Charlize Theron as the evil stepmother.", "The superb cinematography and art direction deserve praise, but they could shorten the middle part of the story.", "Is this tale a commentary on how women often feel used for nothing more than their beauty and therefore chose to think of it as power? Good try.", "At times resembles a multi-million dollar perfume ad set in a fantastical, medieval-inflected world. Yet the central performances shine through and there is just enough humour.", "The writing of this psychological morality tale is superb.", "This is what happens when faerie tales are taken for the explorations of the human game that they truly are.", "Snow White and the Huntsman takes the ageless fable, and makes it dark and exhausting.", "Rupert Sanders' vision of enchantment is a Thomas Kinkade painting brought to life.", "For all its flaws - and there are more of them than in Charlize \"Evil Queen\" Theron's magically aged face - Snow White delivers exactly what you expect from a fairy tale. And more.", "Overall, I enjoyed Huntsman thought it was a good first effort from [director Rupert] Sanders, though pacing and some lazy narrative devices dragged it down a bit.", "One had hoped for better.", "Not a perfect movie by any stretch of the imagination, Snow White and the Huntsman can boast truly magnificent performances--minus Stewart, of course--an interesting take on a beloved tale, and gorgeous scenes. Too bad about some of that plot though."], "rating": ["3/10", "3.5/5", "3.0/4", "C", "", "", "3/4", "", "2.5/5", "", "", "3/5", "3/4", "7/10", "", "", "", "", "", "C+"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Leigh Paatsch", "Richard Propes", "Brent McKnight", "Kathi Maio", "Leslie Combemale", "Matthew Lucas", "Micheal Compton", "Shubhra Gupta", "Nathalia Aryani", "Emily Asher-Perrin", "Daniel Green", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Johnny Gayzmonic", "Sarah Gopaul", "Pat Padua", "Annalee Newitz", "Sarah Marrs", "Neely Swanson", "Candice Frederick"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Indian Express", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Diego Entertainer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tor.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Examiner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fanboys of the Universe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Digital Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">io9.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinesnark", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Easy Reader (California)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Talk Online"], "date": ["December 2, 2020", "October 19, 2020", "September 23, 2020", "July 11, 2020", "March 6, 2020", "July 30, 2019", "June 8, 2019", "April 12, 2019", "March 26, 2019", "January 26, 2019", "January 14, 2019", "January 8, 2019", "January 3, 2019", "October 31, 2018", "September 8, 2018", "August 30, 2018", "May 23, 2018", "October 23, 2017", "September 18, 2017", "September 8, 2017"]}}
