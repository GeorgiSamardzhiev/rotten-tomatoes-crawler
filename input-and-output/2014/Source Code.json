{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Helicopter pilot Colter Stevens (Jake Gyllenhaal) is part of a top-secret military operation that enables him to experience the last few minutes in the life of Sean Fentress, a man who died in a commuter-train explosion. The purpose of Colter's mission is to learn the identity of the bomber and prevent a similar catastrophe. As Colter lives Sean's final moments, he becomes more certain that he can prevent the first tragedy from occurring -- as long as he doesn't run out of time.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 29m", "director": "Duncan Jones", "studio": "MarkGordonProductions", "theater_date": "Apr 1, 2011", "dvd_date": "Dec 20, 2015", "box_office": "$54.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["What begins as a highly engaging science-fiction quandary steadily devolves into a less sincere and confusing predicament that opens itself up for a multitude of plot-holes.", "Michelle Monaghan adds tremendous depth and humanity to a woman who could have easily just been a romanticized caricature or afterthought.", "Source Code is a really strong film. It is a significantly more \"pop\" film than Moon was and will probably reach a wider audience.", "As he did with Moon, [Duncan] Jones, together with screenwriter [Ben] Ripley, tackle concepts few dare to imagine let alone address.", "One of the most exhilarating and satisfying films I've seen.", "[A] bold - and often brilliant - piece of action filmmaking, which artfully blends notions of identity and fate with blockbuster effects and some snappy editing.", "It's just a dumb Hollywood film.", "The cheesiness at times was a negative but I enjoyed the simple effective narrative, and the cast delivers nicely.", "This slickly crafted, time-shifting thriller from director Duncan Jones takes an intriguing premise and mixes it with some compelling twists and turns that make it a fun ride from start to finish.", "Source Code is a streamlined, suspenseful sci-fi thriller served with heart.", "Mostly, though, Source Code satisfies as both science-fiction and crime thriller.", "[Director] Duncan Jones isn't just creating his own career; he's helping to transform a genre.", "This is a film that feels 'smart' without desperately trying to be so. The characters are few and the settings limited, such that complex ideas can peacefully exist inside the film, without tying the narrative in knots.", "If you can overlook the pseudoscientific explanations...you'll be treated to a trippy, head-spinning sci-fi drama with amazingly organic, human characters at its core.", "As science fiction, it's a little shaky. But it's definitely worth seeing-Duncan Jones has delivered an entertaining, fast-paced thriller with characters you actually care about.", "...one heck of a time-bending sci-fi thriller...", "... Source Code is a well-made sci-fi thriller, continuing the evolution of an interesting filmmaker in Duncan Jones.", "Source Code is Quantum Leap meets Groundhog Day meets a train. Silly but fun.", "I'd rather flirt with Michelle Monaghan than hunt down a mad bomber, too.", "Ultimately, Source Code makes good on its Hitchcockian opening sequence -- it may pale in comparison to the master, but it's a fun, puzzle-filled ride, with excellent pacing and a mounting uneasiness that recalls the best episodes of The Twilight Zone."], "rating": ["6/10", "3.5/4", "", "", "4.3/5", "4/5", "", "3.5/5", "", "", "B+", "4/5", "4/5", "8/10", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Ed Travis", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "David Harris", "Nikki Baughan", "Noah Berlatsky", "Kate Rodger", "Micheal Compton", "Nathalia Aryani", "Abbie Bernstein", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Matthew Groizard", "Johnny Gayzmonic", "Annalee Newitz", "Danielle Solzman", "Sarah Marrs", "Lindy West", "Sean Burns", "Una LaMarche"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Jesus", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Roll Credits", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Splice Today", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newshub (NZ)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Diego Entertainer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Assignment X", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Examiner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fanboys of the Universe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">io9.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Solzy at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinesnark", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Stranger (Seattle, WA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Observer"], "date": ["November 30, 2020", "September 24, 2020", "April 3, 2020", "November 16, 2019", "November 6, 2019", "October 23, 2019", "September 18, 2019", "August 29, 2019", "May 8, 2019", "February 16, 2019", "February 16, 2019", "January 8, 2019", "December 14, 2018", "November 4, 2018", "May 23, 2018", "May 13, 2018", "October 24, 2017", "August 25, 2017", "May 3, 2015", "March 23, 2014"]}}
