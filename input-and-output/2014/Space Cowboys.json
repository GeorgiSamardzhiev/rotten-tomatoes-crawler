{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Clint Eastwood, Tommy Lee Jones, Donald Sutherland and James Garner star as a group of pilots whose time has come to serve their country and fulfill their dream of going to space. In 1958, the members of Team Daedalus, a group of top Air Force test pilots, were ready to serve their country as the first Americans in space. When NASA replaced the Air Force for outer atmospheric testing, they were pushed aside for a chimpanzee. The team retired, but the dream of going into space never died.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 9m", "director": "Clint Eastwood", "studio": "MalpasoCompany,VillageRoadshowProd.,MadChance,ClipsalFilms", "theater_date": "Aug 4, 2000", "dvd_date": "Jun 17, 2009", "box_office": "$90.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Space Cowboys is at least three different movies--high-tech thriller, low-key comedy, rumination on aging--jammed together into an implausible but very likable entertainment.", "A cheerful, thoroughly unambitious yarn.", "Weak and saggy script meets predictable plot.", "Problems are evident, and eminent, from a black-and-white flashback prologue in which four young men speak with old actors' voices.
