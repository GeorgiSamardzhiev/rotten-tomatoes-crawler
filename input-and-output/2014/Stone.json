What that something is, though -- besides a four character study in spiritual decay -- is sort of up to you.", "Stone is an unusual film which shifts uneasily between sleaze and philosophy, but it's distinguished at all times by three luminous performances.", "Great performances from the cast in this engrossing drama.", "Stone ultimately feels more confounding rather than profound, (but) it will have you thinking after its credits have rolled.", "An engrossing drama about the difficulty people have believing in forgiveness or in turning one's life around.", "Dark and disturbing, this drama holds our interest due to the strong acting and provocative issues swirling around in the story. But it's a little heavy-handed in its desire to convey something important.", "This film has the kind of suspense where you know something bad is going to happen, but instead of just getting it over with, the film drags it out way too long.", "Seems as weary as the Detroit parole caseworker Robert De Niro plays.", "When did Robert De Niro stop trying? When did he start coasting on his well-deserved reputation, either mocking it in crass comedies or sleepwalking through dramas where fans filled in the missing emotions for him?", "Set up as a familiar noir plot, the film veers off into unexpected places, keeping the audience guessing as to the main characters' motivations well after the credits roll.", "Like a celluloid 'American Gothic,''Stone' does not paint a pretty picture."], "rating": ["3/10", "2.5/4", "C-", "", "3/4", "B-", "", "C+", "", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "2/5", "3/5", "3/5", "C", "C+", "2/4", "3/4", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Brent McKnight", "David Lamble", "Sarah Knight Adamson", "Abbie Bernstein", "Sean Burns", "Jeffrey Overstreet", "Sarah Sluis", "Dave White", "Shaun Munro", "Nev Pierce", "Matt Neal", "Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat", "Rich Cline", "Robert Roten", "Dennis Schwartz", "Lawrence Toppman", "Rob Thomas", "Donald J.
