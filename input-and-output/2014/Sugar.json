By being a little bit bolder, however, they really could have hit it out of the park.", "Sugar is one smart, beautiful movie, and from where I stand, it is an instant classic with the guts and integrity to remain focused on a winning story about a flowering American-immigrant soul.", "Sugar is worth seeing not because it invalidates baseball's meritocracy, or because it makes us feel guilty for enjoying the national pastime, but because it shows us with empathy and insight how baseball players are more than what they do on the field.", "A raw and insightful film that will appeal to viewers who may or may not be sports fans.", "Sugar's personal achievement is uplifting-and it's also cause for celebration when artists create just for the love of the game.", "This captures many moving moments and atmospheres in the diverse settings, bu the narrative arc isn't quite as engaging as it could be.", "The problem is that it is incredibly tedious and at some point very uneventful.", "A familiarity with baseball is probably crucial to getting the most out of this quiet, absorbing drama.", "Just as Hoop Dreams had the urgency of great storytelling, Sugar exhibits the patience of the most penetrating documentary.", "The cinematic equivalent of an investigative Sports Illustrated two-parter.", "You get the perfectly calibrated story of one young man's travels, not just to the United States from his tiny island country but to the land of expectations that come with adulthood.", "I've watched thousands of baseball games and seen tons of baseball movies, but Sugar opened new doors of understanding and insight.", "Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck, the makers of Half Nelson, return with another subtly observed drama about a character on the outskirts of mainstream America.", "Sugar, a baseball movie, an immigrant parable and a thoroughly entertaining drama that accomplishes the seemingly impossible task of putting a fresh face on the fractured American Dream.", "Not only have director-writers Anna Boden and Ryan Fleck crafted a poignant immigrant tale, they've made a sports saga rife with rare truths.", "The camera is on Sugar the whole time, but the faux-documentary approach keeps him out of reach in all the ways that really matter.", "To tell you what happens to him from here would be a tremendous disservice. We'll just say that, refreshingly, nothing about it is sickly sweet.", "Boden and Fleck are attentive to detail and the nuances of social interaction -- in the cornfields of Middle America as well as in the Dominican Republic.
