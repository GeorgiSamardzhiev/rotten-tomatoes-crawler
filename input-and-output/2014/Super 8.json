It's well-paced, emotional, and captures a certain innocence of pre-pubescent youth, without becoming too cheesy.", "Abrams seems more concerned with emulating the Spielbergian way than mining the true emotion that can be felt.", "Feels more like a faded memory than a movie.", "This might not be the most original piece of work, but it's one of those films that show that sometimes familiar can be a good thing.", "Super 8 is pretty much awash in charm.", "The kids are the true stars here.", "Yet Super 8, which was co-produced by Spielberg, is not so much an homage to a master, but a counterfeit copy of one of his originals.", "The trouble is that the answer awaiting at the end of Super 8 simply isn't very satisfying. But don't let that put you off, because the journey to get to this disappointment is a rewarding one.", "The film is covered in a thick syrup of nostalgia that often threatens to choke the life out of it.", "It's impossible not to get caught up in Abrams' nostalgia for summer days at the Cineplex gone by.", "Those stupid interminable close-ups of Dee Wallace-Stone's suburban-mom face, upturned and simpering-will I ever be able to scrub them from my memory?", "No it's not a masterpiece - but it's a solid little movie, and I'd highly recommend it.", "The movie doesn't have all the elements necessary to make it a true classic, but there are some admirable things it accomplishes, especially when the enthusiastic kids are at the forefront.", "No film this year opens more promisingly and ends more dismally than J.J. Abrams' Super 8.", "I really enjoyed Super 8. Kind of loved it, even.", "Like Silly Putty, Super 8 is silly fun. It stretches, snaps, and bounces.
