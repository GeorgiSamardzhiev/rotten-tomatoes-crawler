{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Computer programmer Gus Gorman (Richard Pryor) is hired by financial tycoon Ross Webster (Robert Vaughn) to seize control of a weather satellite and annihilate Colombia's coffee crop. When Superman (Christopher Reeve) manages to thwart the plan, Webster commands Gorman to use the satellite to locate kryptonite, the Man of Steel's mortal weakness. But a missing unknown element in the kryptonite -- replaced by Gorman with tar -- causes an unintended side effect when presented to Superman.", "rating": "30", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 5m", "director": "Richard Lester", "studio": "CantharusProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 15, 2008", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["See this movie for Richard Pryor. Play on your cell phone during the rest. Frankly it's what Gus Gorman would want you to do.", "The film's predecessors were extremely smooth renderings of the comic strip material, but Superman III looks as chintzy as a Grade-B movie serial.", "If not as exhilarating as Superman II, Superman III is surprising and boisterously witty.", "The action is good but this doesn't move the audience in the same way as the first two.", "One expects romance, humor and grandeur, but only gets a frustrating mixture of failed opportunities and missed chances. Bummer.", "For fans of superhero action this is still enjoyable enough entertainment.", "It looks like a comic book, and Lester has seized upon the anything-goes cartoonishness to create a haywire comedy of absurdities and non sequiturs that matches the cuckoo rhythms of the screenplay.", "Right from the beginning you know they are going for total slapstick with a pratfall routine where telephone booths are toppled over. It gets worse from there.", "Superman III may be the saddest dissappointment of the summer movie season.", "Reeve, the ongoing justification for the series, is no longer contractually obligated after this episode, and his liberation comes not an installment too soon.", "Superman is thrown in to the mix somewhere. But he's merely an after thought, and a supporting player in his own film.", "A noticeable drop in quality from the first two, but it's still decent enough that you don't have to be embarrassed for liking it. That comes soon enough...", "Outdated superhero movie may interest older kids.", "Putting its emphasis on broad comedy at the expense of ingenious plotting and technical wizardry, it has virtually none of the mythic or cosmic sensibility that marked its predecessors.", "Richard Lester's direction injects nothing new into the material, giving the feeling that he views the whole thing as an exercise in comedy set pieces.", "Apparently, Richard Lester's intent was to turn Superman into a joke. A really bad joke.", "'Superman contra os avan\u00e7os da tecnologia'. Uma id\u00e9ia cuja estupidez s\u00f3 \u00e9 superada por sua p\u00e9ssima execu\u00e7\u00e3o.", "Reeve continues his traditions of graceful flying moves, confident carriage, and twinkly warmth. Sadly, none of it is enough to save Superman III from being at home only in a junkyard.", "Enjoyable, nevertheless.", "Now retooling the Superman series into middleweight comedy, the script feels written for no one above the age of twelve.
