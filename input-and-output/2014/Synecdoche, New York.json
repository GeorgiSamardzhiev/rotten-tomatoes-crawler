{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Life is looking pretty bleak for theater director Caden Cotard (Philip Seymour Hoffman). His wife and daughter have left him, his therapist is more interested in plugging her new book than helping him with his problems, and a strange disease is causing his body to shut down. Caden leaves his home in Schenectady, New York, and heads to New York City, where he gathers a cast of actors and tells them to live their lives within the constructs of a mock-up of the city.", "rating": "68", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 4m", "director": "Charlie Kaufman", "studio": "", "theater_date": "Oct 24, 2008", "dvd_date": "Feb 12, 2014", "box_office": "$3.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Unveils many interesting ideas, but the purpose of the film is so rooted amongst ambitious creative chaos that few will understand - or care about - its intentions.", "If you engage with the movie on its own terms then even its oddest, most surreal conceits - such as the home that is permanently on fire - make a weird kind of sense.", "Synecdoche, New York is for those who are true cineastes, connoisseurs of cinema who seek more than easy answers, paint-by-number plots and happy endings.", "Insufferable auteurist navel-gazing, its \"postmodernism\" all empty gimmickry to hide an utterly hollow center...", "The film goes on too long, but... needs to be seen twice for all the pieces to click.", "[W]ith Synecdoche, New York Charlie Kaufman has most certainly turned in one of the most beautifully realised, exquisitely made films of the year. Simply put, it's astonishing.", "Kaufman's absurdly comic, achingly melancholy vision manages to be as universal and as all encompassing as the masterpiece that Caden can never finish.", "The film very carefully sets up several interesting ideas, but then drops them as too many conflicting ideas become impossible to juggle.", "As an example of failure, and delusion, it's fascinating but ultimately frustrating.", "Even amid the complexity of his vision, there are moments of searing simplicity and emotional speechlessness that even the most hardened loner among us cannot fail to take to heart.", "The movie is ungainly, but to appreciate it one has to swallow the whole purple pill. As inconsistent as it is, it's still more album than mix tape.", "Brilliantly imagined and perfectly performed, Synecdoche, New York is so heartbroken and strange that it can be compared only to other Charlie Kaufman films.", "", "An important and intriguing film that must be seen to be believed.", "The power and tragedy of the love story, or hell, the life story of Caden Cotard will become a part of you, because it is your story, and his story is yours, and back and forth and so on and on because 'everyone's everyone'.", "Art is a dream through which some seek to rise above the mundane. \"Synecdoche\" is the nightmare of succumbing further to the mundane via art. What could be inaccessible is instead gloriously indispensable - a confounding & combative, but great, film.", "Enough studied and self-conscious ambiguity. If we could offer Kaufman a piece of advice, it would be this: put yourself in your back pocket for a moment, look around at the world and say something substantial about it. It's", "The line between reality and imagination, possibility and pipe-dream, become immaterial, and the film becomes the overflowing contents of a fertile mind spilled out all across the screen.", "His directorial debut is a remarkably deep and rich film, somewhat daunting upon first showing, challenging the audience to take in this complex movie.", "Inaccessible and endlessly frustrating, Synecdoche is replete with art-house pomposity and the type of muddled profundity one sees in an introductory philosophy seminar."], "rating": ["4/10", "", "3.5/4", "", "3/4", "5/5", "4/4", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "5/5", "4/4", "", "6.6/10", "4/5", "1.5/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Jason Best", "Richard Propes", "Dennis Harvey", "Tom Meek", "Nikki Baughan", "Matthew Lucas", "Sarah Manvel", "Brian D.
