Nicolai Dalchimsky (Donald Pleasence), a KGB agent, steals information regarding a secret Soviet operation that planted brainwashed intelligence agents all over America. When Dalchimsky uses those agents to blow up old military buildings, the Soviets send KGB operative Grigori Borzov (Charles Bronson) and a double agent (Lee Remick) to stop him before it's too late.", "rating": "40", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Don Siegel", "studio": "MetroGoldwynMayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 10, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["In Telefon, Bronson has forsaken his Death Wish image of gratuitous violence and offers one of his most interesting and deftly thought out performances to date under Don Siegel's crisply honed direction.", "It moves from continent to continent and city to city and manages to go noplace.", "The main characteristic of Don Siegel's film is its effectiveness... The camera moves with precision and intelligence. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Instead of winding tighter and tighter, as a suspense story should, Telefon just winds down, rather like -- come to think of it -- a phone call between two people who don't really have much to say to each other.", "The ludicrous relationship between these two spies almost destroys what little credibility the story has, but director Siegel keeps their screen time to a minimum and instead concentrates on propelling the narrative at top speed.", "Following Telefon is about as thrilling as being kept on hold for the better part of the day.", "Tyne Daly is notable as a CIA staffer. Remick's teaming with Bronson is a graceful one for both players.", "", "Most disappointing is Siegel's contribution: he, of all directors, should have been able to inject some life into the proceedings, but this is his most nondescript outing in years.", "", "To describe Telefon as synthetic is to take it more seriously than it's taken by anyone connected with it.", "", "This Cold War thriller may not have the most complicated story, but it's curiously effective and has been been surprisingly influential, a nice companion piece to The Manchurian Candidate.", "Siegel handles the action adequately, but this is not one of his best shots.", "Apart from a certain energy evident in the cutting, you'd never know it was the work of Don Siegel, a generally excellent action director."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "1/5", "", "1/5", "", "3/5", "3.5/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Donald McLean", "Bernard Drew", "Fernando Trueba", "Richard Schickel", "", "Gary Arnold", "Variety Staff", "Jake Euker", "Chris Petit", "Emanuel Levy", "Vincent Canby", "Robin Clifford", "Christopher Null", "Film4 Staff", "Dave Kehr"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bay Area Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gannett News Service", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">F5 (Wichita, KS)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reeling Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmcritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader"], "date": ["May 6, 2020", "October 17, 2019", "July 26, 2019", "July 21, 2015", "July 21, 2015", "July 21, 2015", "March 26, 2009", "March 9, 2006", "February 9, 2006", "June 17, 2005", "May 9, 2005", "November 19, 2004", "January 27, 2004", "May 24, 2003", "January 1, 2000"]}}
