{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this musical, Larry Martin (Don Ameche) entertains crowds with his skillful impersonations of airline czar Baron Manuel Duarte (also Ameche). When Duarte and his wife visit Larry during his act, they're also impressed -- so much so that they hire him to impersonate Duarte to save his airline and ward off his competition. However, Larry finds himself drawn to Duarte's wife, Baroness Cecilia (Alice Faye), much to the chagrin and confusion of his girlfriend (Carmen Miranda).", "rating": "53", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Irving Cummings", "studio": "TwentiethCenturyFox", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 20, 2007", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Except for Miranda, it is, at best, tedious.", "Everything gains life and color when Carmen Miranda dominates the scene.
