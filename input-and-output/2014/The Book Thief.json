{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1938, young orphan Liesel (Sophie N\u00e9lisse) arrives at the home of her new foster parents, Hans (Geoffrey Rush) and Rosa (Emily Watson). When Hans, a kindly housepainter, learns that Liesel cannot read, he teaches the child the wonders of the written language. Liesel grows to love books, even rescuing one from a Nazi bonfire. Though Liesel's new family barely scrape by, their situation becomes even more precarious when they secretly shelter a Jewish boy whose father once saved Hans' life.", "rating": "47", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 7m", "director": "Brian Percival", "studio": "SunsweptEntertainment", "theater_date": "Nov 8, 2013", "dvd_date": "Nov 18, 2015", "box_office": "$21.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Doesn't always trust the story to work on its own, so it wedges in a few too many big moments - and one egregious bit of product placement - but when it relies on the performances, it works.", "The film's real selling point proves to be the presence of Geoffrey Rush.", "Impeccably acted and beautifully scripted, The Book Thief is an absorbing effort that captures everything that was so widely admired about the original novel. Co-stars Nico Liersch.", "The Book Thief has stolen my heart. To describe the film in a word, it's quite simply, magnificent.", "As it is, The Book Thief still finds its way into your heart slowly and over time, and it stays there way after leaving the theater.", "It may span the most significant decades of last century, but The Book Thief pretty much boils down to girl-lives-with-family, girl-learns-to-read - for two hours.", "Opening with a sweeping shot of a train racing on snow-covered tracks, a title card reads 'Germany, February 1938'. This kind of vagueness sets up a film that brushes past details in favour of a broad-strokes Nazi movie for the whole family.", "The film is nothing more than a cliche, trying to introduce the subject of war to younger viewers without offering anything of interest to older ones.", "The film has essentially been commissioned on the say-so of pinot-guzzling, chick-lit-licking chocoholics, and it shows. Boy, it's dull and pointless.", "The film is hamstrung by the novel's structure, unsure whether to be a 12A-certificate family outing, or to luxuriate in morbid irony.", "While it may not be suitable for young children, The Book Thief may be one of the best films for families that will play through the holiday season.", "It's probably a little too modest for its potential Oscar goals, but it's a fine film nonetheless.", "The Book Thief manages to capture the horror of war and the tension of life in the Hubermann household, and there are moments that will shock those not familiar with the story.", "'The Book Thief' mixes British actors using German accents, a few German actors, and the occasional German word, creating a playfully successful illusion of German-ness.", "Ultimately not much more complex than the moment in which two children yell \"I hate Hitler\" across a lake, it imparts the message that Nazis are bad, books are good, and Geoffrey Rush would make a great dad even in WWII Germany", "This extremely moving drama suggests the Holocaust story Ray Bradbury might have written: Events are seen through a child's eyes; books are shown to contain a healing, transformative power; and the supernatural is real, if symbolic.", "Zusak's story is stirring, and it holds the film up during most of its predictable parts, but The Book Thief never rises too far above that. The narration from Death only serves to make it more like some sort of fantastical fairy tale.", "Regrettably this poignant and profound story, does not feel very poignant nor profound at all.", "Showing tragic events through a child's eyes can be a powerful storytelling strategy, but there's something altogether too cosy and bland about Downton Abbey director Brian Percival's handling of the material here.", "Tthe film sees Nelisse give a wonderful performance; indeed, the performances are all round good, but the film lacks emotional depth."], "rating": ["3.5/5", "2.5/4", "3.5/5", "", "3/5", "2/5", "2/5", "2/5", "1/5", "", "", "", "3.5/5", "3.5/5", "3/5", "3/4", "2.5/5", "2/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Richard Propes", "Leigh Paatsch", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Leslie Combemale", "Stephen O&#39;Nion", "Di Golding", "Alistair Ryder", "Camilla Long", "Kate Muir", "Josh Terry", "Sarah Marrs", "Francesca Rudkin", "Mark Jackson", "Richard Haridy", "John Beifuss", "Eric Melin", "Stefan Pape", "Jason Best", "Aine O&#39;Connor"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dear Cast and Crew", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemole", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sunday Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Deseret News (Salt Lake City)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinesnark", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Zealand Herald", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Epoch Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Quickflix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Commercial Appeal (Memphis, TN)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Scene-Stealers.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">HeyUGuys", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Talk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sunday Independent (Ireland)"], "date": ["February 1, 2021", "September 4, 2020", "May 4, 2020", "January 7, 2020", "July 31, 2019", "June 8, 2019", "December 11, 2018", "October 21, 2018", "February 22, 2018", "January 2, 2018", "November 29, 2017", "October 20, 2017", "September 8, 2017", "June 7, 2016", "May 5, 2014", "March 24, 2014", "March 22, 2014", "March 10, 2014", "March 8, 2014", "March 7, 2014"]}}
