{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Hazel Grace Lancaster (Shailene Woodley), a 16-year-old cancer patient, meets and falls in love with Gus Waters (Ansel Elgort), a similarly afflicted teen from her cancer support group. Hazel feels that Gus really understands her. They both share the same acerbic wit and a love of books, especially Grace's touchstone, \"An Imperial Affliction\" by Peter Van Houten. When Gus scores an invitation to meet the reclusive author, he and Hazel embark on the adventure of their brief lives.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 6m", "director": "Josh Boone", "studio": "TempleHill", "theater_date": "Jun 6, 2014", "dvd_date": "Jan 4, 2016", "box_office": "$124.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["My biggest complaint about the whole experience was being splashed by the tears of my fellow moviegoers. Bring a towel.", "The reason that The Fault in Our Stars works so well is that its main draw (the teenage love story) is tied so expertly to its emotional core (Hazel's relationship with her parents).", "The winning combo of the shamelessly melodramatic and the slyly mischievous that powers the movie owes much to yet another pitch-perfect lead performance from Woodley.", "Sadly, in Hollywood's hands all the things that made John Green's taut, touching and terrific 2012 novel transcend generation gaps have been jettisoned in favour of a hyperglycaemic tale of two star-crossed (cancer-riddled) teens.", "In other words, this is real. If anyone tells you differently, they haven't a clue.", "In a laudable attempt to seem heartfelt without blatant manipulation, the film generally succeeds, thanks especially to a winning performance from Shailene Woodley.", "It's charming, well-written, superbly acted.", "Heartfelt, sincere and altogether rather wonderful, The Fault in Our Stars will enchant audiences and leave behind very few dry eyes in its wake.", "It all felt kind of manipulative and corny.", "Woodley and Elgort are gifted in that they exude intelligence, thoughtfulness, and savvy, making smart dialogue sound smart, the corniest lines sound terribly romantic and natural.", "Under the assured direction of Josh Boone, the film earns its emotions without grand manipulative gestures, and finds its heart through the fantastic cast and an effortless and appealing intimacy between the characters.", "Dafoe is, as expected, solid in the role, but I felt the storyline on the whole could have been a little tighter. That's a minor fault however, in a script whose stars make it all worthwhile.", "The talented cast and crew enhance what is already some pretty good material, making \"Fault\" a teenage tearjerker that doesn't fall into a typical Hollywood weeper formula.", "It's sweet, cathartic and a bit beautiful. Just make sure you bring Kleenex.", "In the end, this adaptation may not be all that different than effective screen tearjerkers of the past, but in staying true to its source material, its infinity is bound to be a little bigger than most.", "It will certainly be a tearjerker for some, but the film's final triumphant message means that you shouldn't be too depressed when you leave the theatre.", "The two-hour and five-minute running time of continuous sadness and unending pearls of wisdom made this viewer disconnect from the characters.", "The problem may be that The Fault in Our Stars is based on a book by John Green; this certainly wouldn't be the first time a strong literary narrative had troubles translating to the screen.", "Earnest performances lend depth to the characters, making them come alive.", "Nothing beats the performances by Shailene Woodley and Laura Dern -- probably the two best reasons to see this film."], "rating": ["3.5/5", "", "4/5", "2.5/5", "3.5/4", "2.5/5", "9.4/10", "4/5", "D", "8/10", "4/5", "", "A-", "", "", "8.5/10", "1.5/4", "", "4/5", "3.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Rachel Fields", "Leigh Paatsch", "James Croot", "Richard Propes", "Nicholas Bell", "Karl Delossantos", "Patrick Taylor", "Rachel Wagner", "Bernard Boo", "Adam Lowes", "Paula Fleri-Soler", "Micheal Compton", "Amanda Greever", "Stephen Saito", "Jennifer Heaton", "Pamela Powell", "Josh Terry", "Renuka Vyavahare", "Francesca Rudkin"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bitch Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Stuff.co.nz", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Smash Cut Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Way Too Indie", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times of Malta", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Daily Times (Tennessee)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Moveable Fest", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternative Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Journal (Kankakee, IL)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Deseret News (Salt Lake City)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Times of India", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Zealand Herald"], "date": ["February 1, 2021", "January 21, 2021", "November 17, 2020", "November 10, 2020", "September 7, 2020", "August 30, 2019", "August 8, 2019", "June 14, 2019", "April 30, 2019", "March 28, 2019", "March 26, 2019", "March 5, 2019", "February 1, 2019", "January 31, 2019", "November 20, 2018", "November 1, 2018", "August 21, 2018", "November 28, 2017", "November 14, 2017", "September 8, 2017"]}}
