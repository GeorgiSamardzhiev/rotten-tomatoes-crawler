The Grand Budapest Hotel is another eccentricity of its world, where tragicomedy wraps itself of dreams without the need to wake up. [Full review in Spanish]", "\"Times have changed.\" It's an elemental Wes Anderson lament...", "From Ralph Fiennes' dapper strut to Willem Dafoe's pointy teeth, every detail feels just right in the best film of Wes Anderson's career.", "The desire to show fantastic worlds and tell stories in the face of the inevitable march of time and destructive forces is at the core of the film. Anderson's films are beginning to show the soul beneath the exactitude.", "The Grand Budapest Hotel is a fast-paced beautiful spectacle that never ceases to amuse you.", "Magnificent and magical, once you check-in, you'll never want to check-out.", "To alter a phrase from Batman, who won't mind because he's not real, The Grand Budapest Hotel is the movie audiences deserve and the one Anderson needed.", "Those of you who worship at the auteur altar of the director, who have long embraced his fastidious, meticulous style of studied nostalgia and to-the-inch symmetrical specificity, need no prodding.", "Anderson's particular aesthetic can sometimes serve to keep the audience at arm's length, but here it achieves something deeply beautiful, even warm and inviting.", "What the film amounts to is nothing more than a well-done and admirable piece of fluff.", "The sometimes erratic tone and plot machinations mean it may not be perfect, but ignore your reservations and check in to The Grand Budapest Hotel.", "A cat and mouse chase with a lot of humor and whimsey.", "The Grand Budapest Hotel is immense fun and, as far as Anderson's oeuvre is concerned, unquestionably the rarest of fillet steak.", "It is certainly a magical and childlike way of storytelling, even if the content is a little more adult."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "9/10", "4/5", "4.0/4", "4.5/5", "", "8/10", "4.5/5", "4/4", "", "4.5/5", "", "A", "5/5", "4/4", "7/10", "4/5", "B", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "Jordan M.
