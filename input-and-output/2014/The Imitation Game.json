{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1939, newly created British intelligence agency MI6 recruits Cambridge mathematics alumnus Alan Turing (Benedict Cumberbatch) to crack Nazi codes, including Enigma -- which cryptanalysts had thought unbreakable. Turing's team, including Joan Clarke (Keira Knightley), analyze Enigma messages while he builds a machine to decipher them. Turing and team finally succeed and become heroes, but in 1952, the quiet genius encounters disgrace when authorities reveal he is gay and send him to prison.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Morten Tyldum", "studio": "BlackBearPictures,BristolAutomotive", "theater_date": "Dec 25, 2014", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$91.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The film deserves credit for pointing viewers in the direction of such a compelling individual and historical drama.", "Supporting cast and period production values are top notch, but it's Cumberbatch who excels, peeling back the layers of Turing's enigmatic life.", "Unfortunately, the film suffers from a weak script that fails to properly educate the audience about Turing...and it also downplays Turing's homosexuality.", "Manages a surmounting level of intrigue from both its deft performances and its shuffling narrative of past, present, and post-war events.", "The accolades bestowed on this otherwise well mounted but incredibly milquetoast production is the political statement that the film simply does not have the courage to muster on its own.", "It's right that the film is recognised for its dramatic performances, in particular Benedict Cumberbatch who shines in the role as Alan Turing. But ultimately once it ends you may feel you've seen better movies.", "The curious thing about The Imitation Game, without falling into bombast, is that it breaks codes with the wonderful performance of Benedict Cumberbatch. [Full review in Spanish]", "One of the film's achievements comes from hinting at the enormous power possessed by an unseen monarch...", "Benedict Cumberbatch...Mark Strong and Matthew Goode... each delivers enigmatic performances that challenge the audience to think and look below the surface for the truth of each real life character portrayed.", "Though hindsight is always 20/20, The Imitation Game gives us a fair and balanced glance at the tragedies that prejudice and inequality can cause. Turing achieved more in one war-torn decade than Bill Gates or Steve Jobs.", "It is watchable and entertaining but more importantly it's a movie that reveals to the world a man who's achievements many more should celebrate.", "Cumberbatch conveys tortured humanity behind the analytical fa\u00e7ade, even if we also understand and even chuckle at how frustrating Turing could be to those working with him.", "Restrained and tasteful in a very British sort of way, but it almost seems afraid to tackle its subject head on.", "Gorgeously realised, engagingly witty and with great performances all around, The Imitation Game is engrossing and accomplished.", "Keira Knightley is cut-glass and surprisingly convincing as Joan Clark.", "Cumberbatch is great as Turing.", "The only reason I can surmise for the positive reviews The Imitation Game is that it confirms all the \"normal\" audience's worst suspicions about \"genius\" and queer life, without offering any meaningful insight into either.", "To be honest, I'm a bit surprised that there hasn't been more pushback against The Imitation Game by intelligence professionals, historians, and survivors of Turing's circle.", "The Imitation Game is a film that will in all likelihood earn Benedict Cumberbatch his first Oscar nomination, for he absolutely shines as Alan Turing in this top-notch biopic.", "The Imitation Game purposefully hits the mark in shining the light on one the most heroic figures of the 20th century."], "rating": ["", "4.5/5", "5/10", "8/10", "3/5", "3/5", "7/10", "", "", "", "4.5/5", "3.7", "2/4", "4/5", "4/5", "B+", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Richard Crouse", "Nicole Ackman", "Mike Massie", "Nicholas Bell", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Yasser Medina", "David Lamble", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Alexander Ryll", "Leslie Combemale", "Josh Goller", "Matthew Lucas", "Danielle Davenport", "Alexa Dalby", "Rachel Wagner", "Ren Jender", "Christian Caryl", "Paula Fleri-Soler", "Nathalia Aryani"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Next Best Picture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Confessions From A Geek Mind", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bay Area Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gay Essential", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dog and Wolf", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bitch Flicks", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New York Review of Books", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times of Malta", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Diego Entertainer"], "date": ["February 12, 2021", "February 2, 2021", "January 30, 2021", "December 4, 2020", "October 28, 2020", "July 15, 2020", "June 26, 2020", "June 18, 2020", "December 14, 2019", "September 15, 2019", "August 2, 2019", "July 19, 2019", "July 5, 2019", "June 15, 2019", "June 4, 2019", "April 30, 2019", "March 11, 2019", "March 7, 2019", "February 26, 2019", "January 25, 2019"]}}
