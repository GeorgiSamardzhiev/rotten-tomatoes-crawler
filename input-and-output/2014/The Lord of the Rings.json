[Full Review in Spanish]", "A film that, despite its palpable narrative shortages, is not only fascinating regarding its visual commitment, but also because it laid a strong base for the material shot by Jackson a quarter of a century later. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Lacking a firm center in Frodo's story, the film plays itself out as a bewildering parade of elves, dwarves, ores, trolls and talking trees.", "[W]e should be grateful that Bakshi has tried so hard to be faithful to the original that its spirit and inspiration often shine through to stir the blood.", "A genuine cult movie", "Bakshi proves once again that he is a master of his chosen medium.", "Lord of the Rings never makes that wondrous leap to the land of the imagination.", "Ralph Bakshi's imagination was on the Fritz; his animated version of Tolkien's fable made Middle-earth look like Grand Central Station during the rush hour of the Ores.", "It seems less concerned with Tolkien than the West Coast drug culture of the mid-1970s and as a herald of New Ageism.", "Full of epic effects and breathtaking battles the film reflects Bakshi's ingenuity, with photographic imagery and light show effects expanding the limits of the palette used in previous animation features.", "It's a divisive film but I appreciate some of the choices that it made.", "Even the most magical fantasy falls to earth if it's not clear who's who and what's happening, as every maker of fables should know.", "Tolkien fans, who are familiar with novels, will find it enjoyble, while others may be confused by the action.", "Innovative and beautiful, cheesy and disjointed.", "What most people remember is the mix of the live-action tracing within the traditional animation and just how effectively creepy it managed to be, but for the time this did a pretty good job of adapting the dense novels.", "It looked terrible then and it still does: cartoon characters move differently from live actors, and the attempt to duplicate natural movement ends in stylistic incoherence.", "It's a reckless film, blitzing through some plot points and stalling out over others; the lack of a particular rhythm does not do it any favors, and it is certainly not a fast 133 minutes.", "A contemporary viewing of The Lord of the Rings is an exercise in outlandishness as well as nostalgia: dreamlike, peculiar.", "Animated adventure too dated and dark for younger kids.", "Quite simply, those who do not know the characters of Middle Earth going in will not know them coming out."], "rating": ["", "", "", "3/5", "7/10", "", "", "", "2/5", "", "6/10", "", "2.5/5", "", "4/5", "", "4/10", "", "2/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos", "V\u00edctor L\u00f3pez G.", "Paul Gray", "Sky Staff", "Film4 Staff", "Bernard Drew", "Lawrence O&#39;Toole", "People Staff", "Adrian Turner", "Rick Chatenever", "Rachel Wagner", "Ted Whitehead", "TV Guide Staff", "Sabadino Parker", "William Thomas", "Dave Kehr", "Tim Brayton", "Michael Nordine", "Sandie Angulo Chen", "Variety Staff"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sky Cinema", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gannett News Service", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Maclean&#39;s Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Santa Cruz Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rachel&#39;s Reviews (YouTube)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">PopMatters", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Not Coming to a Theater Near You", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety"], "date": ["August 12, 2019", "July 31, 2019", "March 26, 2019", "March 26, 2019", "March 26, 2019", "March 26, 2019", "March 26, 2019", "March 26, 2019", "March 26, 2019", "March 26, 2019", "February 12, 2019", "June 24, 2015", "December 3, 2012", "December 3, 2012", "December 3, 2012", "December 3, 2012", "November 25, 2012", "October 14, 2011", "August 3, 2010", "July 7, 2010"]}}
