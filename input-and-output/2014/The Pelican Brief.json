But depicting a POTUS at odds with his FBI director and creating obstruction of justice concerns aligns it with Pakula's other preternaturally predictive potboilers.", "Pakula's always had a cool style, tending toward solemnity, but let's face it, All the President's Men this movie is not. You wish he'd have a little more fun with the pulpy material.", "Both Roberts, with her intense fragility, and Washington, with his thoughtful heroism, prove invaluable in pulling us into the heart of the film.", "It all sounds thrilling enough. So why is it so dull? Chiefly because of a central flaw in Grisham's writing, which Hollywood is unable to smooth out -- its grinding pedantry.", "A juicy conspiracy theory thriller.", "A routine thriller, curiosuly disappointing from Alan Pakula that even stars like Denzel Washington and Julia Roberts can't rescue", "Talky political thriller won't engage kids.", "If I would still call it one of Pakula's very best films since the end of the 1970s, that says far more about the decline of his career than anything else.", "If only The Pelican Brief were purposefully controversial.", "A shallow bore.", "This is a standard Grisham pot-boiler.", "It's too bad that Pakula allows this 1993 movie to dawdle after its climax, but prior to that he's adept at suggesting unseen menace and keeping things in motion.", "You'd think that Pakula would be just the man to tease the intellectual and emotional depth out of a Grisham potboiler, but you'd be wrong. [Blu-ray]", "Pakula has improved on Grisham's book by excising much of the detritus, crafting a taut, intelligent thriller that succeeds on almost every level.", "A curiously disappointing thriller from Alan Pakula, reaffirming the notion that John Gresham's best-selling novels are more fun to read (at the airport) than watch on the big screen, even if they star Denzel Washington and Julia Roberts.", "Definitely an easy rental and a good way to drown a couple of hours if you're looking for a little suspense, some law stuff, lotsa secondary players and a couple of renowned leads delivering the goods.", "An old hand at this sort of thing, Pakula goes through the motions, but not much more.", "", "", "Julia good Denzel better."], "rating": ["3/4", "", "", "", "B-", "C", "3/5", "6/10", "0.5/4", "2/4", "", "", "2/4", "", "C", "6/10", "", "3/5", "5/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nick Rogers", "David Ansen", "Malcolm Johnson", "Quentin Curtis", "Dennis Schwartz", "Emanuel Levy", "Joyce Slaton", "Tim Brayton", "Walter Chaw", "", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Peter Canavese", "Brian Lowry", "Emanuel Levy", "JoBlo", "Derek Adams", "Michael Dequina", "Jules Brenner", "Eric Lurio"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Midwest Film Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent on Sunday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Freak Central", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Groucho Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">JoBlo&#39;s Movie Network", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieReport.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Signals", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Greenwich Village Gazette"], "date": ["June 24, 2019", "May 3, 2018", "May 3, 2018", "December 12, 2017", "March 7, 2017", "June 18, 2011", "January 2, 2011", "January 14, 2010", "April 1, 2009", "March 30, 2009", "March 30, 2009", "March 30, 2009", "February 10, 2009", "November 5, 2008", "October 8, 2006", "May 5, 2006", "February 9, 2006", "February 27, 2005", "February 18, 2005", "December 21, 2004"]}}
