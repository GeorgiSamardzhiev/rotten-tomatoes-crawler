Now, together with Wyatt's best friend, Doc Holliday (Val Kilmer), the brothers pick up their guns once more to restore order to a lawless land.", "rating": "74", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Western", "runtime": "2h 7m", "director": "George P.

Much less attention went to making one believe that any of the events took place circa 1879.", "A spectacular and well acted bit of Western cinema and sadly one in an endangered genre species...", "Sports pretty much everything one would want in a Western, and though it's not always eminently artful, it is rarely anything less than entertaining. [Blu-ray]", "One of the finest Westerns to come along since the genre decided largely to pack up and ride into the sunset several decades ago.", "It has an energetic flow, and a genuinely rugged, exciting feel, unlike many of the more bloated, picturesque examples of the Western genre.", "It takes a lot more than the passage of time to value Tombstone. Naps, earplugs, and possibly tremendous amounts of alcohol also assist in the proper digestion of the feature.", "Doesn't really cut it in the Western genre.", "A tough-talking but soft-hearted tale that is entertaining in a sprawling, old-fashioned manner.", "Dated and flawed, but super cool for Val Kilmer's brilliant performance as Doc Holiday.", "", "It has problems - a LOT of problems - but as bubblegum westerns go, there's also a lot to like.", "I liked the film but I would've liked to have seen some of the first hour trimmed, and the romance taken out completely.", "There's a misguided romantic subplot and the ending rather sprawls, but mostly this is rootin', tootin' entertainment.", "", "", "", ""], "rating": ["", "4.5/5", "2.5/4", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "D+", "2/5", "", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5", "7/10", "", "3/5", "2/5", "3/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Ed Travis", "Blake Howard", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Peter Canavese", "Ryan Cracknell", "Jeffrey M.
