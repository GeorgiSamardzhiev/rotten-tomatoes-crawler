{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Police drama about a veteran officer who escorts a rookie on his first day with the LAPD's tough inner-city narcotics unit. \"Training Day\" is a blistering action drama that asks the audience to decide what is necessary, what is heroic and what crosses the line in the harrowing gray zone of fighting urban crime. Does law-abiding law enforcement come at the expense of justice and public safety? If so, do we demand safe streets at any cost?", "rating": "73", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h", "director": "Antoine Fuqua", "studio": "NPVEntertainment,VillageRoadshowProd.", "theater_date": "Oct 5, 2001", "dvd_date": "Jun 22, 2010", "box_office": "$76.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This could have been just another corrupt-cop thriller if it wasn't for the involvement of Denzel Washington, who works spectacularly against type in to come up with one of the more memorable screen villains.", "We hadn't seen Washington play the bad guy before, and with his ferocious, dominating, and charismatic performance, the Oscar was his...", "Training Day is not a completely unnuanced parable on policing and a nice disavowal of the movie-perpetuated clich\u00e9 of smug, streetwise copdom.", "An extraordinary [Denzel] Washington dominates the film.", "'Training Day' is still a very interesting thriller where Denzel Washington truly shines just as the lucid but equally necessary and inspired work of Ethan Hawke. [Full review in Spanish]", "Great performances, but for adults only.", "A surprisingly excellent movie with Incredible performances...", "", "", "The movie moves rapidly, is extremely violent and not entirely plausible.", "If he makes it through the trial by fire -- and a blandly twisting plot with no meaningful revelations or substantial themes -- Hawke will get a promotion, but there's nothing in it for us.", "", "This isn't a serious movie, despite Denzel Washington in full eruption and giving his calloused lines more weight and authority than they deserve.", "My guess is that the conceit was meant to be that Denzel's a bad guy, and that's fun to watch. Instead, this just adds another to his list of bad film's he's acted in...", "Cast against type as a corrupt cop, Denzel Washington, usually seen in noble and heroic roles, is nothing short of brilliant; with some luck, he should earn an Oscar nomination.", "Marred slightly by an unsatisfactory climax, this is a cracking cop drama anchored by great performances and intelligent direction from Fuqua.", "Director Fuqua keeps it slick and sleazy and stokes up the race some, but this only accelerates the movie's deafening rush toward the top and ever over.", "Thumbs up, without question. Unfortunately, Training Day could have been so much more than it is.", "Denzel Washington delivers a remarkable performance in this enthralling and unique tale of a corrupt cop, completely transforming himself into an unexpectedly imposing threat.", "...an intelligent and riveting action movie that doesn't rely on a lot of special effects to tell a genuinely interesting story."], "rating": ["3.5/5", "", "3/5", "", "", "3/5", "", "3/5", "3/5", "", "", "3/4", "3/5", "D+", "A-", "4/5", "", "3.5/4", "8.5/10", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Leigh Paatsch", "Wilson Morales", "PJ Nabarro", "Sophie Gorman", "Mikel Zorrilla", "Nell Minow", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Stacie Hougland", "Mark Halverson", "Philip French", "Lisa Alspector", "Joe Lozito", "Rob Gonsalves", "Jason Gorber", "Emanuel Levy", "Chris Hewitt (UK)", "", "Steven Snyder", "Andrew Manning", "David Nusair"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">indieWire", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Herald (Ireland)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sacramento News &amp; Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Observer (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Big Picture Big Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Scouts", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Zertinet Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Free Entertainment", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews"], "date": ["September 11, 2020", "March 31, 2020", "December 9, 2018", "October 17, 2017", "February 2, 2017", "December 29, 2010", "April 29, 2009", "November 20, 2008", "August 7, 2008", "April 9, 2008", "April 9, 2008", "December 27, 2007", "August 5, 2007", "June 21, 2007", "January 4, 2007", "December 30, 2006", "February 9, 2006", "October 1, 2005", "January 15, 2004", "August 1, 2003"]}}
