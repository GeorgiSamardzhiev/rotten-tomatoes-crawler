It was for me and millions of other kids in the early 1970's. It has a great message and an uncompromising way of making its point at the end. Kids need this movie.", "The popular comic strip was made into a nice, Oscar-nominated big-screen entertainment.", "An hour and a half is a long time for any child -- or beagle -- to be amusing, and the whimsy that attempts to fill the time frequently falters.", "The animated adventures of the 'Peanuts' gang come off surprisingly well in this feature-length treatment, largely because the film is faithful to the spirit of the famous comic strip.", "Schulz's script maintains much of the irony of the strips, but the injections of whimsy put its appeal uneasily between adults and children.", "The appeal of Schultz's pop philosophy hasn't faded in forty years: this kind of sincerity can't be faked.", "", "", "", "The only really dreadful contribution to the film is that of Rod McKuen, whose three songs can barely be endured.", "Charming; still the best of the 'Peanuts' feature films", "", "Many people I know swear to this day that they learned the 'i' before 'e' spelling rule from the jingle in this movie.", "", "", ""], "rating": ["", "", "3/4", "5/5", "A", "B-", "", "2.5/4", "", "3/4", "5/5", "3/5", "2/5", "", "4/5", "4/5", "", "3/5", "5/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Margaret Hinxman", "M.V.
