{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Living a life marked by violence and racism, neo-Nazi Derek Vinyard (Edward Norton) finally goes to prison after killing two black youths who tried to steal his car. Upon his release, Derek vows to change his ways; he hopes to prevent his younger brother, Danny (Edward Furlong), who idolizes Derek, from following in his footsteps. As he struggles with his own deeply ingrained prejudices and watches their mother grow sicker, Derek wonders if his family can overcome a lifetime of hate.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 58m", "director": "Tony Kaye", "studio": "NewLineCinema,Turman-MorrisseyCompany", "theater_date": "Oct 30, 1998", "dvd_date": "Jul 1, 2008", "box_office": "$6.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The entire project is largely amateurish and incompetent on a technical level.", "It's a gripping drama and a useful take on learning how to unlearn systemic beliefs.", "One of the year's more absorbing films.", "A tale of intergenerational racism and all it brings upon those who fall in line with a hideous ideology. Powerful, brutal, and takes proper aim at white supremacy.", "American History X advocates that \"those who ignore history are doomed to repeat it\"? It's a powerful social document and should be part of your film watching curriculum.", "Norton is an amazing actor, a hot-dog whose delight in transformation is infectious.", "A well-made, well-acted and often violent film that offers a compelling portrait of redemption and the destructive nature of racism.", "This dark drama is not for kids.", "If didactic and overwrought at times, it's also powerful and persuasive. [Blu-ray]", "...a violent film on a weighty topic...frank and honest, its characters, actions, and ideas compelling the viewer to look further and become involved.", "Any idiot can make us wince at the ugliness of beatings and shootings.", "", "Two things hold the interest: Norton's astounding performance, and a feeling for the male reality of reactionary working class environments.", "Well-intentioned and well-acted but unconvicning, this saga provides an instructive example to the simplistic approach taken by movies when tackling the social problem of racism.", "American History X is flawed, yes, but is a worthwhile film that covers territories not dealt with in recent years.", "Pesado e incmodo, discute o racismo com inteligncia e conta com uma interpretao absolutamente impecvel de Edward Norton.", "", "Derrick's journey to hell and the one back are portrayed organically and gradually.", "If the message of the film gets a bit didatic, or the storyline balance is a little off ... it hardly matters in the end.
