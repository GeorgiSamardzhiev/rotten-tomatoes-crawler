{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Inspired by real-life killers Charles Starkweather and Caril-Ann Fugate, this tale of crime and love begins in a dead-end town.

After a conflict between Holly and her father erupts in murder, the young lovers are forced to flee. In the ensuing crime spree, they journey through the Midwest to the Badlands of Montana, eluding authorities along the way.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Cult Movies/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Terrence Malick", "studio": "BadlandsCompany,Pressman-Williams", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 31, 2014", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The film is admirable visually, verbally, psychologically. It took guts for a neophyte film maker still in his twenties to fire two cinematographers before a third gave him what he wanted; yet the result is seamlessly impeccable.", "Terrence Malick's amazing debut feature, Badlands, which basically made the careers of everyone whose name was attached to it.", "It signals the directorial debut of what appears to be a knowledgeable, almost classically precise, important young filmmaker, Terrence Malick.", "Everyone concerned with Badlands has my admiration -- Martin Sheen and Sissy Spacek... Warren Oates as her father; and all of the less familiar actors but most of all, Terrence Malick, who wrote and directed Badlands. It is clearly his triumph.", "Angry young white men.", "Malick's love and respect for the natural world as it frames and moves characters is palpable and on full display, the film heightened by superb performances and Malick's incredible direction.", "A masterly exercise in ironic narration, and of a director so wholly in command of the rhetoric of his medium.", "If a portion of American cinema is going to remain devoted to violence, it could learn a lot by revisiting Malick's thoughtfulness.", "[VIDEO ESSAY] Terrence Malick's self-penned feature debut is a haunting road movie pitched in '50s Americana. The film's razor-sharp tone of poetic irony is unique.", "The movie is just as free, experimental, and unsure of itself as its main characters are, and thus fits like a glove.", "This tender treatment does nothing to alleviate the horror of the atrocities committed.", "In the fall of 1973, one could see signposts of cinema's future in Mean Streets and The Exorcist, yet with this youthful pair of proto-indie dreamers, Malick was paving a whole new road. It turned out to be the path most traveled.", "It's a testament to Bruce Greenwood's acting that Adan never becomes entirely as insufferable as the words that come out of his mouth.", "One of Malick's most resonant notions in Badlands is that everyone confronts mortality in his or her own way.", "Malick has come to be known and revered as a cinematic poet and philosopher, as a filmmaker who explores big ideas, but in Badlands in particular he also shows a knack for off-kilter humor.", "In his debut, Terrence Malick is an uncanny creator of pearlescent forms, a very stark balladeer, Mark Twain's coolly ferocious heir", "Incredibly beautiful, of course (you may have heard that Malick movies are famous for their landscapes), but it's not \"just\" beautiful.", "...the first of Malick's many screen Edens, all of which inevitably come to a violent end.", "Malick's film, full of striking cutaways to the burning-sun horizon and the harsh landscape's solitary creatures, comes to operate at an overpoweringly chilling remove.", "Days of Heaven put Terrence Malick's intuitions into cogent form, but this is where his art begins."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "A+", "A", "9/10", "5/5", "4/4", "", "A", "", "1", "3.5/4", "A", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["John Simon", "CJ Sheu", "Dick Lochte", "Bernard Drew", "Michael J.
