[Full review in Spanish]", "Beasts of No Nation is high caliber cinema.", "It will be seared into viewers' memories for quite some time.", "Beasts is a harrowing experience, but a powerful one. It might read as derivative to a cynic, but there's something palpable at the film's core that can't be denied.", "The cast's intense young actors are to be applauded, as is the film's stance as a thought-provoking (and crushing) piece of cinema - but twenty minutes fewer would alleviate violence fatigue.", "Violent, but not without reason, Fukunaga brings out the best of his actors, his story, and his resources for a movie that will sit heavily in your heart and thoughts long after the credits roll.", "Fukunaga and his actors -- especially the two leads -- have managed to create a riveting drama which is suitably appalling.", "It's a one-hundred-percent humanistic, visceral story that transcends any issue or conflict you could read about in the news.", "Beasts Of No Nation is a masterful film; assured, confident, artful.", "BEASTS OF NO NATION brings the tension, along with the tears through the crippling fear that encompasses the landscape...", "Needless to say, but Alba is so damn amazing. For the most part, he was convincing, he was totally committed to that role.", "This is a powerhouse of a film about a subject matter most people might not even realize exists to the extent that it does. It's assured and confident with a deeply sympathetic center that carries you to the end.", "A tough, but rewarding watch. As this is Netflix's first charge into feature films, they have set a pretty high bar for themselves.", "The result is a film that is at once diligently dramatic and oddly becalmed, a film about unutterable horror that isn't particularly horrifying.", "Beasts of No Nation is that rare monster of a film that is incredibly difficult to watch, yet impossible to look away from", "Beasts as a film is worthy of its terrific lead performances. In case there was any doubt, Fukunaga is a MAJOR talent, and ought to be writing his own ticket from here on out.", "Beasts of No Nation holds sway with cogent, putrid effect, at once terrifying and sickly seductive.", "[Beasts] is a mesmerizingly grim adaptation of Uzodinma Iweala's novel."], "rating": ["8/10", "A-", "9/10", "", "A", "6/10", "3/5", "4/5", "4/5", "8.5/10", "", "A", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "5/5", "", "", "A-"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tony Asankomah", "Allen Almachar", "Yasser Medina", "VyceVictus", "Leslie Combemale", "Dominic Griffin", "Tori Brazier", "Mae Abdulbaki", "John Bleasdale", "Bernard Boo", "Ed Travis", "James Clay", "Jaby Koay", "Erik Anderson", "William Evans", "Nat Segnit", "Robert Kojder", "Sarah Marrs", "Jay Kuehner", "tt stern-enzi"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">GhMovieFreak", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Birth.Movies.Death.", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Deadshirt.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies with Mae", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Way Too Indie", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinapse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fresh Fiction", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">GET Jaby", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AwardsWatch", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Black Nerd Problems", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Harper&#39;s Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flickering Myth", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lainey Gossip", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Scope", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cincinnati CityBeat"], "date": ["November 20, 2020", "July 14, 2020", "June 26, 2020", "February 6, 2020", "October 16, 2019", "July 16, 2019", "April 23, 2019", "April 10, 2019", "April 8, 2019", "February 27, 2019", "February 2, 2019", "December 14, 2018", "September 25, 2018", "August 27, 2018", "June 13, 2018", "March 22, 2018", "December 4, 2017", "October 14, 2017", "October 10, 2017", "September 21, 2017"]}}
