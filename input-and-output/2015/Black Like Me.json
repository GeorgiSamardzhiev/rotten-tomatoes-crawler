After undergoing treatments to darken his skin, Horton ventures from town to town, experiencing hostile racism from whites whom he doesn't provoke in any way. He also interacts with blacks and finds that they simply want justice, though some are pessimistic that change will ever come peacefully.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Carl Lerner", "studio": "TheHilltopCompany", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 13, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Such unnecessary devices as flashbacks after the opening (so that the film could open with pizazz and fill in background later) reduce a unique and fascinating story to mere low-budget cliche."], "rating": [""], "fresh": ["rotten"], "critic": ["Merl Edelman"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Free Press"], "date": ["January 24, 2020"]}}
