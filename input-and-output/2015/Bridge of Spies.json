{"metadata": {"synopsis": "During the Cold War, the Soviet Union captures U.S. pilot Francis Gary Powers after shooting down his U-2 spy plane. Sentenced to 10 years in prison, Powers' only hope is New York lawyer James Donovan (Tom Hanks), recruited by a CIA operative to negotiate his release. Donovan boards a plane to Berlin, hoping to win the young man's freedom through a prisoner exchange. If all goes well, the Russians would get Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance), the convicted spy who Donovan defended in court.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 21m", "director": "Steven Spielberg", "studio": "AfterworksLimited,StudioBabelsbergIndependents[de]", "theater_date": "Oct 16, 2015", "dvd_date": "Feb 23, 2016", "box_office": "$72.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Tom Hanks is pleasant and convincing as a war hero of the non-combatant kind, humanized through plenty of humor.", "Bridge of Spies features Spielberg as master storyteller.", "Bridge of Spies sheds relatively little light on a critical epoch.", "Bridges of Spies presents a piece of history that people will know for generations to come.", "Stellar pieces never come together like they need to, or like they could have.", "[E]xplaining the tonal disjunction[:] The film is about the spy-swap, yes, but the symbolic level is also about reaffirming American values of justice.", "An excellent drama capable of creating tension through dialogue. [Full review in Spanish]", "It is a very cunning spy thriller that follows the path of Spielberg's historical films. [Full review in Spanish]", "The real power of Bridge of Spies is that it adheres to a sadly old-fashioned code of decency and equal justice for all under the law.", "Working from an excellent screenplay by Matt Charman that was rewritten by Joel and Ethan Coen, both Hanks and Spielberg are at the top of their game.", "Spielberg paints everything in broad strokes, and yet for a character-driven spy film to succeed, it's the smaller moments that are the most important-but here they're left behind.", "It's an excellent thriller who knows how to handle a difficult cocktail of drama, tension and humor. [Full Review in Spanish]", "An almost invisible camera shows us a Russian spy trapped by the FBI - impeccable sequence, in which Spielberg articulates a certain suspense based on details.

And there's nothing wrong with that.", "As perhaps one of the most quintessentially American filmmakers, Spielberg holds a mirror up to the past and sees us as we are now, a society doomed to repeat our past mistakes if we don't learn from them.", "Bridge of Spies is absolutely what it appears to be: an interesting story told well by talented people. That is sadly still all too rare among Hollywood studio filmmaking.", "It does end in a satisfactory way and over all it isn't a terrible film, just disappointing.", "Spielberg crafts some delightful visual moments, but the editing is often clumsy in stitching together his ever-deliberate camera movements.", "The film's semi-slow pacing, lack of urgency and generally anti-climactic premise take its toll in a film that is nearly two and a half hours long."], "rating": ["7/10", "3.5/4", "", "5/5", "C+", "", "", "7/10", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "B", "3.5/4", "8/10", "C", "3/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "David Walsh", "Danielle Solzman", "Brent McKnight", "CJ Sheu", "Ricardo Gallegos", "Yasser Medina", "Tim Brennan", "Chris McCoy", "David Harris", "Mikel Zorrilla", "Alberto Abu\u00edn", "Brian D.
