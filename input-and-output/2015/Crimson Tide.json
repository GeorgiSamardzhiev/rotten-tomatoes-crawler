{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After the Cold War, a breakaway Russian republic with nuclear warheads becomes a possible worldwide threat. U.S. submarine Capt. Frank Ramsey (Gene Hackman) signs on a relatively green but highly recommended Lt. Cmdr. Ron Hunter (Denzel Washington) to the USS Alabama, which may be the only ship able to stop a possible Armageddon. When Ramsay insists that the Alabama must act aggressively, Hunter, fearing they will start rather than stop a disaster, leads a potential mutiny to stop him.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Tony Scott", "studio": "HollywoodPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$91.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Simpson/Bruckheimer have plunged to the ocean's depths to reach the heights of commercial, big-movie filmmaking.", "Crimson Tide is a whale of a movie, an intense and a heartstopping adventure played out against the unnerving threat of nuclear annihilation.", "Crimson Tide has many lessons to offer that are relevant to this day.", "Perfectly-paced high stakes drama with a brain, its dilemmas both huge in scope and deeply personal.
