As the movie wears along, they become death.", "[Streep], Hawn and Zemeckis combine to offer a fearsome look at what, under different circumstances, might well have happened to Baby Jane.", "Quirky but enjoyable oddity.", "This pitch-dark comedy may be seen as a biting satire on the tendency to fetishize personal appearance and youthfulness. But its inventiveness quickly wears thin, and the filmmakers show an unhealthy fascination with the spectacle of mutilated women.", "Certainly, \"Death Becomes Her\" is macabre and mean. But it's also wise and cuttingly witty.", "This new horror-comedy has to be one of the most heartless mainstream pictures ever made.", "If there were something resembling genuine satire of human behavior beyond the simple pretexts for fancy special effects and relentless sadism, I might have found some of this funny.", "An elaborate piece of work with more than a little on its nasty mind, \"Death\" finally falls flatter than many a less ambitious film, proof once again that just because an idea is audacious doesn't necessarily mean it's good.", "Meryl Streep shines in a glitzy black comedy, but it's still She-Devil with a make-over.", "Insistently grotesque, relentlessly misanthropic and spectacularly tasteless, ''Death Becomes Her'' isn't a film designed to win the hearts of the mass moviegoing public. But it is diabolically inventive and very, very funny.", "The effects are awesome, if occasionally too gruesome to enjoy. All in all, however, Death Becomes Her is clever, different and dementedly entertaining, while commenting on our unhealthy obsession with youth and beauty.", "Despite some clever moments, especially early on, Robert Zemeckis' new black comedy about aging, success and failure ultimately falls crashingly down -- like the catastrophes it so fondly dwells on.", "Zemeckis has always relished technical challenges; once again he pulls them off with high style.", "Streep, Hawn comically, murderously, defy age and death.", "...one of the least engaging endeavors contained within Zemeckis' early filmography.", "The script by Martin Donovan and David Koepp never lacks for cleverness, but it's ultimately more frantic than funny."], "rating": ["1", "1", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "4/5", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "2.5/4", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Avaryl Halley", "Andrew Galdi", "Candice Russell", "Victor Dwyer", "Stephen Hunter", "People Staff", "Sue Heal", "David Sterritt", "Dennis King", "Jay Boyar", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Kenneth Turan", "Richard Corliss", "Dave Kehr", "Jeff Menell", "Malcolm Johnson", "David Ansen", "Barbara Shulgasser", "David Nusair", "Matt Brunson"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Maclean&#39;s Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing"], "date": ["August 12, 2020", "August 12, 2020", "March 26, 2019", "March 26, 2019", "January 3, 2019", "January 3, 2019", "January 3, 2019", "January 3, 2019", "January 3, 2019", "January 3, 2019", "January 3, 2019", "January 3, 2019", "January 3, 2019", "January 3, 2019", "August 7, 2018", "June 5, 2018", "February 9, 2018", "November 14, 2017", "November 27, 2016", "May 7, 2016"]}}
