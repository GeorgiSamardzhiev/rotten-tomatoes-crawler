And the cinematography is undeniably striking. But I can't say I enjoyed it.", "The first half is oppressive, cluttered, and funny, but as the film forsakes its artificial settings for more open spaces, it becomes pale and mechanical.", "[It's] Rainer Werner Fassbinder's most obsessively arty movie and by no means his best. Even so, it is wildly distinctive.", "Unpleasant but thoughtful and provocative psychodrama set in Berlin, in the 1930s.", "Fassbinder films life in the cosseted class as a masque of glass and mirrors, replete with alluring deceptions and suave surfaces that belie volcanic passions.", "Everything about Despair feels queasily off - the plot, the acting, the dialogue and the fussily over-decorated sets.", "A superb surrealist noir.", "Effortlessly literate [and] gaudily stylish.", "Not one of [Fassbinder's] best.", "Of the authorial trifecta that created Despair, director Rainer Werner Fassbinder's voice is the most pronounced.", "A lambent house of cards", "Despite a witty, albeit theatrical, script by Tom Stoppard, prolific German director Rainer Werner Fassbinder does not quite bring off the spirited linguistic innovations, wit and penetrating insights of Vladimir Nabokov's novel.", "It is beautifully photographed by Ballhaus in a frame filled with reflective glass and mirrors.", "Bogarde never allows us to dismiss Hermann, or worse, to pity him. He remains endlessly fascinating, even at his most repellent.", "The result is a marvel of literate, elegant dialogue and, if nothing else, Fassbinder deserves credit himself for not being afraid to take chances.", "Bold, garish and obsessive, but more than a little irritating.", ""], "rating": ["1/4", "", "", "2/5", "", "4/5", "B+", "", "2/5", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "4/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Elliott Stein", "John Skow", "Ted Whitehead", "Wendy Ide", "Dave Kehr", "", "Dennis Schwartz", "Richard Brody", "Philip Kemp", "Peter Bradshaw", "David Jenkins", "Jeffrey M.
