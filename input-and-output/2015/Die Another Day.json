{"metadata": {"synopsis": "James Bond (Pierce Brosnan) is captured by North Korean agents and must serve a grueling prison sentence. He's finally released, and is convinced that someone in his own agency betrayed him. He escapes from custody and travels to Cuba, hot on the heels of Zao (Rick Yune), the agent who put Bond behind bars. Meanwhile, Bond begins romancing NSA agent Jinx (Halle Berry) as he uncovers a scheme concocted by Zao and British millionaire Graves (Toby Stephens), involving a highly destructive laser.", "rating": "57", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 10m", "director": "Lee Tamahori", "studio": "EonProductionsLtd.,UnitedArtists,DanjaqProductions,MetroGoldwynMayer", "theater_date": "Nov 22, 2002", "dvd_date": "Oct 1, 2016", "box_office": "$160.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Sadly, the introductory scene is far better than anything else in the picture; it desperately deserves a grander movie to herald.", "This film is bad - seriously and shockingly bad.", "It's definitely [Pierce] Brosnan's worst Bond film.", "Die Another Day is a tale of two halves, the first half is mostly good, the second is nearly always awful. This is how Pierce Brosnan's Bond goes out, which is a damn shame.", "With work like this, I'm sure #21 can't be too far behind. Thank goodness Brosnan isn't ready to throw in the towel yet. Better keep those martinis comin' folks. And make that shaken, not stirred.", "The film is a frantic roller-coaster ride from which you emerge exhausted, with a massive blur in the head.", "this incarnation of Bond is just plain fun", "Plenty entertaining, but consistent with most of Brosnan's Bonds, a few misguided decisions keep it from being a classic.", "By honoring the Bond iconography of girls, guns and cars, Tamahori and the screenwriters are able to do something new with Bond: They dare to suggest that Bond is not only human, but also fallible.", "It's the same old Bond.", "Die Another Day faithfully hews to the James Bond formula, giving us all the elements and allowing the '60s formula to not only live, but prosper, into the the new millennium.", "Tamahori senses what Bond fans have been missing. He and Brosnan deliver it with style, both deserving to try another day.", "Adding to the grimness: The title song is from Madonna, a dreary bit of lightweight electro-pop that goes on and on to little effect.", "Strange, is it not, how the regular bombardment of thrills can have quite the opposite effect of the one intended.", "In a year when Austin Powers has scoffed at 007 as a joke and xXx has scoffed at him as an anachronism, Die Another Day is a fluffed opportunity to assert that nobody does it better.", "A vigorous 20th installment that is as strong on action as it is weak on the interpersonal stuff.", "James Bond gets bad news in Die Another Day: They've rescinded his license to kill. The news is worse for us. They've given him license to bore.", "By the end of Die Another Day, the character's potential to wind up beaten and broken has vanished amid the pixels and laser beams.", "Perhaps it's time to say goodbye to Mr. Bond.", "Pierce Brosnan is the best Bond since Sean Connery -- and this is the best Bond movie since Connery's run."], "rating": ["1/10", "1.5/5", "D+", "2/5", "", "2/4", "4/5", "7/10", "", "", "3/4", "B+", "2/4", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "B"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Chris Stuckmann", "David Hogan", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Namrata Joshi", "Kevin Carr", "Jeffrey Lyles", "Joanna Connors", "Peter Rainer", "John Wooley", "Steve Persall", "Matt Soergel", "Anthony Quinn", "Nicholas Barber", "Jami Bernard", "Joe Morgenstern", "Keith Phipps", "Christy Lemire", "Joel Siegel"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Confessions From A Geek Mind", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ChrisStuckmann.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">hoganreviews.co.uk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Outlook", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fat Guys at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lyles&#39; Movie Files", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cleveland Plain Dealer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Magazine/Vulture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tampa Bay Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Florida Times-Union", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Good Morning America"], "date": ["September 29, 2020", "July 16, 2020", "April 3, 2020", "February 21, 2020", "November 7, 2019", "January 3, 2019", "January 10, 2016", "November 7, 2015", "November 2, 2015", "November 2, 2015", "November 2, 2015", "November 2, 2015", "November 2, 2015", "November 2, 2015", "November 2, 2015", "November 2, 2015", "November 2, 2015", "November 2, 2015", "November 2, 2015", "November 2, 2015"]}}
