{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Tris Prior (Shailene Woodley) lives in a futuristic world in which society is divided into five factions. As each person enters adulthood, he or she must choose a faction and commit to it for life. Tris chooses Dauntless -- those who pursue bravery above all else. However, her initiation leads to the discovery that she is a Divergent and will never be able to fit into just one faction. Warned that she must conceal her status, Tris uncovers a looming war which threatens everyone she loves.", "rating": "41", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 20m", "director": "Neil Burger", "studio": "RedWagonEntertainment", "theater_date": "Mar 21, 2014", "dvd_date": "Apr 27, 2016", "box_office": "$150.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Divergent is Hunger Games light, but Woodley and James bring some heat to the leads and it's fun watching Kate Winslet sneering her way through a villainous role.", "Falling victim to the same problem of many science-fiction or fantasy epic startups, the story is 90% introduction.", "It doesn't help that the music by Junkie XL is overwrought and dominating in the worst of ways.", "Despite a good lead performance, what we have is a glossy shell but not much underneath.", "It is glaringly obvious that the movie version of Divergent is influenced by the success and popularity of The Hunger Games and sadly this underwhelming film did not deliver.", "Bland, clunky, and lifeless.", "I was bored.", "It's like Hunger Games, meets Enders' Game, meets every YA book you've ever read.", "Divergent suffers in comparison to Hunger Games. But when judged alone, Divergent makes a strong case for the entertainment value of an empowered young female hero attempting to survive and resist in a dystopian society.", "A possibly compelling idea gets lost in the mire of trying to be appealing to a core audience that doesn't want to work hard for narrative reward.", "The film is more interesting than the average bad movie precisely because it so gratuitously, and even thematically, fails to fit together.", "This is a rite-of-passage film, with action, romance and self-realization woven in. But unlike some others of this genre, Divergent is thought-provoking teen sci-fi.", "Saved by Woodley and James' performances, Divergent has every trope a teenage fan could ask for, and not much else.", "Divergent is chock-full of holes, but Woodley and her bright band of co-stars try valiantly to save the day.", "The story is told in a much too clinical fashion.", "Divergent doesn't have the same mass appeal, but it doesn't make it any less impactful than the best that this genre - the science fiction genre, not the young adult subgenre - has to offer.", "While I can't recommend \"Divergent\" to anyone not already fans of the novels, I will say I'm interested in where this series goes.", "Woodley makes things believable... and she and James sell their understated relationship.", "Woodley plays her part so believably you can't help but root for her despite the juvenile, it's-okay-to-be-different, people-aren't-just-one-thing thematic undertones so simply expressed for the training bra set.", "Divergent wishes it had nearly the imagination, creativity and angst-ridden scope as its obvious competitor in Games.
