The real disenchantment will be among audiences -- even those responsive to the picture's message -- because of the film's chaotic, undefined style.", "A disorganized but occasionally brilliant movie about two college students and the world they, and we, inhabit.", "All of the film's characters, and all of the performances, are touched with the kind of unexpected sensibility and decency that are rare in most films of this genre.", "Ultimately, there's no theme here that isn't addressed more coherently and directly in a more conventional film like Five Easy Pieces.", "Nicholson's personality comes through in the film's rhythms: crazed and vibrant at times, classical and refined at other times."], "rating": ["B-", "C", "B", "", "2/4", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "3/5", "", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Dennis Schwartz", "Robert Roten", "Emanuel Levy", "Fernando F.
