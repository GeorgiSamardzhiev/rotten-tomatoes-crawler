{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Chauffeur Edwina \"Eddie\" Franklin (Whoopi Goldberg) is fanatical about the New York Knicks basketball team. After she wins a contest to be their honorary assistant coach, Eddie so impresses the team's owner (Frank Langella) that he fires the head coach, John Bailey (Dennis Farina), and replaces him with Eddie. She is instrumental in turning the floundering team around, just in time to make the playoffs. There, they will face the Charlotte Hornets -- now led by former Knicks coach Bailey.", "rating": "18", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Steve Rash", "studio": "PolyGramFilmedEntertainment,PermutPresentations,IslandPictures,HollywoodPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 1, 2003", "box_office": "$31.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Even with many fouls, Whoopi's film still is entertaining.", "The next hour or so is filled with the Knicks committing turnovers, until a player tells Eddie they'll keep losing until she takes an interest in their personal lives.
