{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Banished by an evil queen, Princess Giselle (Amy Adams) from a fairy-tale world lands in modern Manhattan, where music, magic and \"happily ever after\" are sorely lacking. She is adrift in this strange new place until a divorce lawyer (Patrick Dempsey) comes to her aid. Giselle begins to fall for her flawed benefactor, but the storybook romance gets complicated when a prince from her world comes to rescue her.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Comedy/Kids & Family/Romance", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Kevin Lima", "studio": "WaltDisneyPictures,JosephsonEntertainment", "theater_date": "Nov 21, 2007", "dvd_date": "Nov 23, 2015", "box_office": "$127.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A blend of traditional animation and live action that is sure to delight younger audiences - and, possibly, older crowds too.", "Enchanted says it all.", "A clever throwback to a bygone era that is very much a product of this one; a clash of past and present combining for something truly magical.", "Disney's Enchantedis a fun homage to all the Walt Disney Animation Studios classics.", "Director Kevin Lima's new film Enchanted is seemingly made for all the women who grew up on fairytale endings. But growing up is perhaps the wrong word to use. Permanently infantilized might be a better term.", "In Enchanted, even the vermin whistle while they work.", "In the hands of Adams, the evolution elicits as much sympathy as it does laughter, largely because she grounds every pivotal moment in wide-eyed kindness and generosity, pushing us to care about her fate.", "After about half-an-hour the comic steam is dispersed by whimsy, though Timothy Spall is pretty funny as the Evil Stepmother's varlet valet.", "Delightful stuff.", "This delightfully funny and smart family film certainly lives up to its title.", "By the time you are reading this, the ads will already be proclaiming that Enchanted is \"enchanting,\" and for once they'll be spot on.", "The result is a fresh, feel-good crowd-pleaser that pokes affectionate fun at fairytale conventions while remaining true to their spirit.", "It's so sugary that the adults in the audience should beware of the dangers of Type 2 Diabetes, though overall this is a great film to take the kids to during the school holidays.", "Narrated by Julie Andrews with Marsden gleefully camping it up and Adams the personification of winning charm, only a Scrooge would deny the film possesses oodles of fun and wit. It's just not as enchanting as it deserves to be.", "Sometimes the big studios get it right. Enchanted is a high-concept fish-out-of-water tale that works on so many levels it's dizzying. Plus, it features a breakout performance by the luminous Amy Adams.", "Enchanted is as conventional as the films it tries to satirize.", "Amy Adams is a star in the making.", "This large-scale Disney family film is sheer delight.", "There's no big shocker ending in Enchanted, and it follows a pretty typical formula, but what makes it a winner is its ability to make you smile anyway. Be forewarned, you might even get a cheek ache.", "Enchanted is a sweet romantic fable, with some loveable performances and some genuine good humour."], "rating": ["6/10", "3.5/4", "3/4", "", "", "B", "3.5/5", "", "3/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "", "3/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "4/5", "3/4", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Matthew Lucas", "Danielle Solzman", "Dorothy Woodend", "Craig Outhier", "Katherine Monk", "Philip French", "Jim Schembri", "Mark Adams", "Scott Foundas", "Henry Fitzherbert", "Emma Gardiner", "Mike Davies", "Glenn Sumi", "Todd Gilchrist", "Margaret Pomeranz", "David Stratton", "Kim Brown", "Andrew Hedley"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">From the Front Row", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Solzy at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Tyee (British Columbia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orange County Register", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Canada.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Observer (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Age (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Mirror (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">L.A.
