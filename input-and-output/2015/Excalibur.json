{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The magical sword of Excalibur starts off in the hands of British lord Uther Pendragon (Gabriel Byrne) and then, years later, finds its way to his bastard son, Arthur (Nigel Terry), the knave destined to become king. Aided by the sorcerer Merlin (Nicol Williamson), Arthur fulfills his fate by bringing together the Knights of the Round Table at Camelot and unifying the country. However, this flawed monarch faces greater tests ahead in pursuit of love, the Holy Grail and his nation's survival.", "rating": "80", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "John Boorman", "studio": "WarnerBrothers", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2009", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Imperfect as it is, ''Excalibur' is the bravest approach ever made in the cinema of the figure of King Arthur. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Excalibur feels like watching ancient legend brought to life, not refurbished for modern palettes.", "There is no real difference between \"Kagemusha\" and \"Excalibur\" except for our inability to savor our heritage as much as the Japanese appreciate theirs.", "This is the Arthur legend at its most primal, romantic and tragic, human and supernatural, set on the cusp between the old gods and the Christian God.", "The attempt in Excalibur to produce recognisable or at least historical figures results only in a kind of anachronistic bathos; the content of the film never quite matches up to the technological and cinematic expertise which went into its production.", "As a plunge into the feeling, rather than the denotative qualities, of medieval literature, it's a great pleasure.", "Well, if there's anything wrong with [John] Boormans' version, it's just fancy and obviously in bad taste. [Full review in Spanish]", "The result is almost always the handsomest of films to behold. Storywise it has its moments, too, although it never quite achieves the difficult blend of grandeur and madness for which it strives.", "Excessive but occasionally inspired, Excalibur gives us grimy lumbering knights, gloomy castles, slithering dragons, mesmerizing magic, and (of course) the struggle between good and evil.", "Despite moments of high style and wit, [Excalibur] too often substitutes mayhem for magic.", "Give Boorman credit for the loopy grandeur of his imagery and imaginings, for the sweet smell of excess, for his heroic gamble that a movie can dare to trip over its pretensions -- and still fly.", "The search for the Holy Grail and the final battle are simply stunning sequences, and, while the dizzying pace leaves scant time for proper characterisation, Nicol Williamson, Nigel Terry and Helen Mirren make their mark.", "Perhaps the best-ever filmed version of the Arthurian legend.", "There is humor here (in the form of a vaudeville Merlin, played by Nicol Williamson) as well as a diminution of scale that seems intended to help audiences through the thornier byways of Boorman's vision.", "Remains the definitive big screen telling of the Arthurian legend.", "a work of hideous myopathy", "Excalibur is both sober and laughable.", "John Boorman's magnificent and magical Excalibur is, to my mind, the greatest and the richest of screen incarnation of the oft-told tale.", "Epic King Arthur saga with illicit affairs and brutality.", "Exquisite, a near-perfect blend of action, romance, fantasy and philosophy, finely acted and beautifully filmed by director John Boorman and cinematographer Alex Thomson."], "rating": ["", "7/10", "3.5/4", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "3.5/4", "0.5/4", "", "", "3/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Nathanael Hood", "Burl Burlingame", "Sean Axmaker", "Peter Ackroyd", "Tim Brayton", "Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos", "", "", "Ralph Novak", "Richard Corliss", "Alan Jones", "", "Dave Kehr", "Scott Nash", "Walter Chaw", "Jeffrey M.
