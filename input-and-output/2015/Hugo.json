{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Orphaned and alone except for an uncle, Hugo Cabret (Asa Butterfield) lives in the walls of a train station in 1930s Paris. Hugo's job is to oil and maintain the station's clocks, but to him, his more important task is to protect a broken automaton and notebook left to him by his late father (Jude Law). Accompanied by the goddaughter (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz) of an embittered toy merchant (Ben Kingsley), Hugo embarks on a quest to solve the mystery of the automaton and find a place he can call home.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Kids & Family/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 6m", "director": "Martin Scorsese", "studio": "GKFilms", "theater_date": "Nov 23, 2011", "dvd_date": "Jun 6, 2014", "box_office": "$73.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A lengthy history lesson rather than a real adventure.", "Hugo is the master's new sublime work especially intended for lovers of the seventh art who long to light the wick of the magic wand of the cinema of the past. [Full review in Spanish]", "\"Hugo\" may be the film closest to the heart of Scorsese, a dedicated cinephile and film preservationist.", "Hugo has plenty to indulge a silent film aficionado -- or to educate a young film buff.", "Overall, Hugo is like a Christmas present - the wrapping is beautiful but the present itself is a disappointment.", "Exquisitely acted and a heretofore unequalled artistic use of 3D.", "Two hours of remarkable cinema that is, dare I say it, truly magical. Somehow, I think Melies would have been proud.", "I've not been a fan of 3-D films in general, but Hugo takes full advantage of the technology, creating a storybook-like world with rich layers and textures. That alone is enough to make Hugo worth seeing, but the film is much more.", "Hugo is reverent, but also joyful -- we come away from the film feeling like we're lucky to have all this in our history.", "It can't be counted a modern classic like so many of Scorsese's other films. But it's a charming flight of fancy, if not for children, then for their parents who are still young at heart.", "Martin Scorsese's family fantasy blend[s] a beautifully imagined treasure hunt with a tribute to cinema's early pioneers.", "Whether young or old, Hugo remains an arresting, heartwarming delight and one of the must-see films of the festive period.", "It just, somehow, doesn't come across, doesn't add up to anything memorable.", "For Scorsese the door to the past is never closed. Hugo does not so much revisit the past as reveal that it is still alive, elaborately disguised as the present.", "However, it is when Scorsese moves to celebrate the early magic of silent cinema with some inspired flashback sequences that his film really hits a glorious stride.", "The first thing to say... is that it is a visual wonder... But the second thing to say is nothing else is as exciting as the look of it and if there is a third thing it is this: Hugo himself is rather boringly bland and I didn't much care for him.", "Hugo falls short in imagining that using one's talents toward useful work alone satisfies our need for significance. But its message that we are all here for a purpose, endowed by our creator with good gifts, is a rare subject for cinema.", "Beyond its value as a technical marvel, Hugo's most rewarding aspect may be the spirit of kindness and community that fills the final act.", "Scorsese luxuriates in artifice, but at its generous best Hugo offers a lovely instance of technology made human and spun from one generation to the next.&#65279;&#65279;", "A wonderful film about film cloaked in an emotional and deeply rewarding, multi-layered children's tale ."], "rating": ["5/10", "8/10", "", "", "1/5", "", "4/4", "", "B+", "3/4", "A-", "4/5", "", "", "4.5/5", "", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Yasser Medina", "Loren King", "Pamela Hutchinson", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Leslie Combemale", "Matthew Lucas", "Micheal Compton", "Abbie Bernstein", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Kiko Martinez", "Daniel Green", "Eileen Jones", "Geoffrey O&#39;Brien", "Leigh Paatsch", "Deborah Ross", "Megan Basham", "Jason Anderson", "Fernando F.
