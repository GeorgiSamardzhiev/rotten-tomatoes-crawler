But the film never pulls you in.", "\"I do just what I want to do/ I want everything and I want you, too/I wish I could explain to you/But the things men without women do/You just don't understand.\"", "The filmmakers do not feel the need to fill in every single blank for viewers by the time the credits roll. Just as in reality, these characters' problems are not going to be solved with the wave of a magic wand; there are no short cuts to happiness.", "The movie's remaining revelations build slowly into a set of surprisingly powerful emotional beats.", "Impressively directed, thoroughly engaging drama with terrific performances and a superb script. This is one of the best films of the year.", "For all the pains it takes to establish mood and character, Jindabyne hides under its own uneasy surfaces; it never allows enough sense of what this community really is, of what's to be grieved when it comes apart.", "Jindabyne is not about just one murder but about the death by a thousand cuts that happens in its aftermath.", "Apart from a contrived ending, Jindabyne comes as close as can be to a perfect drama.", "A fish tale worth telling and worth hearing.", "It's safe to describe Jindabyne as a haunted movie."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "B", "2/5", "5/10", "4.5/5", "C+", "3/5", "8", "4/10", "3/4", "2.5/4", "8", "3.5/5", "3/4", "5/5", "3/5", "3/4", "4/5", "3/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jeff Simon", "Nell Minow", "Cliff Doerksen", "Heather Huntington", "Jennie Kermode", "Robert Roten", "S.
