{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Physical therapist Leslie Wright (Queen Latifah) lands the dream job of working with basketball superstar Scott McKnight (Common). All goes well until Leslie finds that she is falling in love with him. Scott, however, is oblivious to Leslie's romantic overtures and focuses his attention on Morgan (Paula Patton), Leslie's gorgeous friend, who would love to be the basketball player's trophy wife.", "rating": "46", "genre": "Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Sanaa Hamri", "studio": "FlavorUnit,DebraMartinChase", "theater_date": "May 14, 2010", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$21.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["In a Queen Latifah film, and most assuredly in this Queen Latifah film, love is always possible and even the people who disappointment you the most are ultimately redeemed.", "Latifah and Common have great chemistry and it's another romance where we like both of them and want to see them happy.", "tries to do too many things", "All of this predictability and retreading of the same old formula just makes for one long, stretched-out film that leaves the audience waiting for the inevitable to happen.", "The audience, much like Latifah, is surprised and utterly won over by Common's disarming, nice guy affability beneath the intimidating aura.", "Although it's replete with solid supporting players and even stronger goodwill, Just Wright buckles under the burden of its pure intentions. Too many auxiliary, moralizing plot points and characters are picked up, only to be suddenly dropped.", "You've seen it before -- it lifts from Pretty Woman and The Truth About Cats & Dogs, to name a couple -- but you won't hate seeing it again.", "Just Wright's heart is in the right place. It just doesn't know what to do with it.", "Flips the over-expressed male fantasy of the socially awkward guy who somehow ends up with the hottest girl.", "Just about bearable.", "A bland Cinderella story that never steps out of its comfort zone.", "It might not be the blandest rom-com youve ever seen, but its sure within striking distance.", "Utterly predictable, unbearably trite.", "Easy-going and sweet-natured, this \"romantic sports comedy\" finally dissolves into a gooey mess of over-cooked comfort food.", "It's rescued by the warmth of the two central performances. It also makes a pleasant change to see a woman of generous proportions land a handsome guy.", "Take a pro basketball player with a career-threatening knee injury and an ugly-duckling nurse and you've got the blueprint for a steamroller of sopp that knows no shame.", "Likeable turns from Queen Latifah, Common and Pam Grier elevate the fairly rote material -- no big surprises here -- into a fun, basketball-based spin on the romantic-comedy.", "If film titles get any lazier than this, I'm flying to Hollywood and setting fire to the Writers' Guild HQ building.", "For the romatically inclined, it's just right.", "Stays watchable thanks to a charming, likeable performance from Queen Latifah, but it's also insipid, predictable, overlong and occasionally annoying."], "rating": ["2.5/4", "8/10", "1.5/5", "2/4", "3/4", "2/5", "2.5/5", "5/10", "6/10", "2/5", "", "2/5", "1/5", "2/5", "3/5", "2/5", "3/5", "2/5", "3/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Rachel Wagner", "Kevin Carr", "Jeff Beck", "Michael Dequina", "Lisa Rosman", "Dave White", "Joshua Starnes", "Jeffrey Chen", "Charlotte O&#39;Sullivan", "", "David Edwards", "Marc Lee", "Peter Bradshaw", "Christopher Tookey", "Sam Wigley", "Angie Errigo", "Robbie Collin", "Tim Evans", "Matthew Turner"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">7M Pictures", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Examiner.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheMovieReport.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ComingSoon.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ReelTalk Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Express (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Mirror (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Mail (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">News of the World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sky Cinema", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ViewLondon"], "date": ["September 13, 2020", "March 7, 2019", "December 9, 2013", "October 1, 2012", "April 8, 2012", "November 17, 2011", "April 4, 2011", "March 29, 2011", "October 15, 2010", "September 22, 2010", "September 20, 2010", "September 17, 2010", "September 16, 2010", "September 16, 2010", "September 16, 2010", "September 16, 2010", "September 15, 2010", "September 15, 2010", "September 15, 2010", "September 15, 2010"]}}
