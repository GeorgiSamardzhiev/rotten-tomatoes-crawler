{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Noriko (Setsuko Hara) is perfectly happy living at home with her widowed father, Shukichi (Chish\u00fb Ry\u00fb), and has no plans to marry -- that is, until her aunt Masa (Haruko Sugimura) convinces Shukichi that unless he marries off his 27-year-old daughter soon, she will likely remain alone for the rest of her life. When Noriko resists Masa's matchmaking, Shukichi is forced to deceive his daughter and sacrifice his own happiness to do what he believes is right.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Yasujir\u00f4 Ozu", "studio": "Sh\u00f4chikuEiga", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 27, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A story that is so heartbreaking and yet so perfect in every decision made and every word spoken.", "Terrifying film about a woman who wants to be single pressured into marriage.", "Yasujiro Ozu's early domestic masterwork has been given a gorgeous restoration which makes it even more treasurable-if possible-than ever.", "Each shot in Late Spring is striking on its own; the mature Ozu belongs to that rare category of filmmakers whose work can be recognized from a single frame.", "\"Movies resurrect the beautiful dead,\" Susan Sontag once wrote, and there's no better way to commemorate Hara than to watch her in Late Spring, a film in which she is heartbreakingly vibrant.", "Sadness is tempered with humor, even to a 'good luck' wallet found under a policeman's nose, just as, tempered by the unknown and unforeseeable, life itself is sweet as well as bitter.", "Ozu's low camera position helps the audience relate to his characters, and his almost-always static shots portray the sturdy demeanor of his characters.", "Ozu trains his trademarked fixed camera on the deceptively simple story of a father and daughter and finds in it nothing short of the whole wide world.", "impermanence... forms the film's true subject - and it is Ozu's ambivalence towards it, as though he wants both to board the train, and to stay on the platform, that ultimately gives Late Spring its bittersweet resonance.", "Haiku-like in its title, its interest in the undramatic silences between scenes, and its enfolding of human behaviour within nature, Late Spring offers tenderness in the place of melodrama and patient truth in the place of sudden revelation.", "An early indicator of Ozu's late-career greatness, his remarkably subtle family drama Late Spring finds him at his expressive peak.", "Late Spring is, along with Tokyo Story, Ozu's greatest work.", "One of the director's favorites.", "Ozu's camera is observational, rather than intrusive; even when we get something akin to a close-up, it never feels like it's invading the character's space.", "the work of a master", "Exquisite ... What little plot there is in Late Spring is adorned by Ozu's Zen-like meditation on objects, surroundings and the Japanese concept of mono no aware -- the ineffable resignation to the reality of life as things are.", "welcome respite from mindless, dispassionate cinema", "Late Spring exemplifies Ozu's rich, mature style, an apparent stylelessness of patient, lifelike rhythms, unobtrusive camerawork, and credibly subtle performances.
