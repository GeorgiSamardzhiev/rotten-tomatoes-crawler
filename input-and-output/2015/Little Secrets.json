{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Emily (Evan Rachel Wood) is a plucky preteen who is entrusted with her young neighbors' most private and cherished secrets. Every Wednesday, Emily sets up a booth in her backyard that regularly attracts the guilty young souls of the neighborhood. These include Philip (Michael Angarano), whose clumsiness and his interest in Emily make him a challenging client. But complications ensue when she suddenly finds it difficult to keep all of her neighbors' secrets to herself.", "rating": "60", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 34m", "director": "Blair Treu", "studio": "SamuelGoldwynProduction,TriStarPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$405.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A very broad annoying and overemotional little drama...", "", "", "These character live in an unblemished neighborhood, where everyone has bite-sized problems that can easily be resolved with a few kind words, a hug, and some tears.", "Every plot development is telegraphed from a mile away, and every character acts in the most obvious manner possible.", "Begins in the vein of a Joe Dante suburban satire but ends like a nightmare of Chris Columbus poppycock.", "", "At least it's a viable alternative to the usually predominate brainless super-charged kids fare that's thrown on the big screen. And for that, Treu's cinematic \"little secret\" is worth telling out loud.", "Few parents [the kind likely to have made Little Secrets and to whom it seems primarily aimed] will find anything objectionable in this sanitized after-school special-esque of a film, lately that's progress.", "The kids in this syrupy family picture are spunky tykes and the adults are dolts, but Wood is worth watching because she's so clearly ready to play nobody's girl but her own.", "There are a lot of movies out there made for fourteen-year-old boys, a ton of movies made for six-year-old kids, this movie is made for ten-year-old girls and for what it is, I really like it.", "This is simply good filmmaking, and deserving of your attention.", "Little Secrets is a sweet little movie, and you don't have to keep that a secret.", "To a large degree, Little Secrets succeeds in a valiant effort to portray a teens struggling with the inevitable pitfalls along the bumpy road to adulthood.", "What you end up with are a bunch of kids acting not like kids, but how adults who've lost all sense of what it was like to be a kid think kids behave.", "The movie's chipper charms, and its steadfast determination to present an alternative to overly merchandised multiplex fare (there's nary a pop song or product placement here), ultimately win out.", "A touching film that will make audiences smile and cry at young characters who are learning about love and confession.", "It somewhat breaks the tone when Emily admits, 'Mom is very anal,' but then Emily is anal, and so -- nicely -- is the movie.", "It's a beguiling exploration of friendship, trust, truth, insecurity and, yes, secrets.", "Stick with it and you may find some unexpected pleasures here, especially performances by two adolescent stars who elevate the film above some often-shaky writing."], "rating": ["", "4/5", "3/5", "C-", "C-", "2.5/4", "C+", "2.5/4", "B", "C+", "", "A", "3/4", "2.5/4", "", "2.5/4", "3/4", "2/4", "3/4", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Mark Halverson", "Emanuel Levy", "Jeffrey Overstreet", "Josh Bell", "Bill Chambers", "Eric D.
