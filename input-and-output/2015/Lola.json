{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Von Bohm (Armin Mueller-Stahl) comes to a city in West Germany to be the new head of building inspection. He is intent on following the letter of the law, even with rapid development and extensive construction activity. Gradually, he becomes enamored with Mary-Louise (Barbara Sukowa), but does not know she is \"Lola,\" a singer at a brothel, until he arrives for an inspection there. Von Bohm also doesn't realize that she is also involved with a rival, the developer Schukert (Mario Adorf).", "rating": "100", "genre": "Documentary/Drama/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Rainer Werner Fassbinder", "studio": "RialtoFilm,WestdeutscherRundfunk,TrioFilm", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 15, 2020", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The self-aware candor of the actors' efforts converges with Fassbinder's cinema of consciousness, not cynical or knowing cinema but a critical one...", "Despite its emulation of classical Hollywood Technicolor, Lola, much like the other films in the trilogy, is often insular and cold, holding the audience at arms length.", "Lola has a basic simplicity that controls Fassbinder's excesses in its mise-en-sc\u00e8ne. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Had Robert Altman not already employed the title 3 Women for his 1977 gem, that would have handily served as a header for Rainer Werner Fassbinder's acclaimed BRD Trilogy.", "A fascinating satire and skillfully mounted drama, Lola works because its post-World War II setting has a lot more in common with early 80s politics than I think most people at the time realized.", "\"Lola\" is indelibly, ineffably Fassbinder, a demanding, compelling film that virtually imposes a reaction on its viewer. To realize that the intelligence behind these images has been stilled is to be truly saddened.", "Lola transcends broad satire and, as with Fassbinder's best pictures, finds the raw humanity at the heart of the film's heightened reality.", "I'm delighted to see someone running Rainer Werner Fassbinder's Lola. Actually, I'm just delighted to see someone running any Fassbinder film.", "It's a political fairy tale about duplicity and hypocrisy in which everything, including ethics and human flesh, is for sale, and self-esteem and worth is measured only in terms of money.", "It's wonderfully provocative as only Fassbinder can be.", "Again Fassbinder returns to Germany's past to reveal the workings of its stagnant moral present to powerful effect, boldly combining melodramatic storytelling, vibrant performances, garish visuals and searching analysis.", "Lola is a well-acted film which showcases Rainer Werner Fassbinder's laser-sharp social consciousness.", "A bitter, brisk, sometimes abruptly moving satire about the West German economic 'miracle' of the 50's.", "[An] interesting and rewarding experience for those who can appreciate German cinema and great directors at work."], "rating": ["", "2.5/4", "", "3/4", "", "", "4/5", "4.5/5", "3.5/4", "A", "", "", "4/5", "7/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Brody", "Matthew Lucas", "Diego Gal\u00e1n", "Matt Brunson", "Andrew Parker", "Bruce McCabe", "Christopher Machell", "Ken Hanke", "Michael Scheinfeld", "Dennis Schwartz", "Tom Dawson", "Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat", "Vincent Canby", "Dragan Antulov"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">From the Front Row", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Frenzy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Gate", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Globe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spirituality &amp; Practice", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rec.arts.movies.reviews"], "date": ["February 13, 2021", "August 22, 2019", "August 21, 2019", "August 10, 2019", "August 28, 2018", "April 27, 2018", "July 5, 2017", "February 17, 2011", "September 18, 2006", "August 21, 2006", "March 30, 2004", "February 4, 2004", "January 6, 2004", "November 11, 2002"]}}
