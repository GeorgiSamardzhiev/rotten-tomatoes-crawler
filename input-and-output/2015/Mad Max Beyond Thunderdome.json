{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the third of the \"Mad Max\" movies, Max (Mel Gibson) drifts into an evil town ruled by Turner. There he becomes a gladiator and gets dumped in the desert where he is rescued by a band of feral orphans who have been looking for help for years. When several of them take his appearance as a sign and go off into the desert, he follows them back to the town.", "rating": "80", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "George Miller, George Ogilvie", "studio": "KennedyMillerProductions", "theater_date": "Jul 1, 1985", "dvd_date": "Aug 15, 2008", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The suspense is still effective and the climactic railroad chase at the conclusion handsomely echoes the other outrageous stunts of the trilogy.", "This is a wild, imaginative action film that truly shows what the power of cinema can accomplish in even the direst of situations.", "In a sense, it's sort of the Return of the Jedi of the Mad Max series: It's solid, it's engaging, but yeah, it's also a kind of a step down from the previous two", "It's comic books in a Cuisinart, all costumes and cute monikers and no story, a sort of case history of just what's wrong with sequelitis.", "It's hard not to wonder why Beyond Thunderdome isn't better.", "Outrageously sinister, unblinkingly violent, Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome is everything that fans of the futurist road warrior could hope for and more.", "This middle portion of the picture becomes dangerously preachy, but just before we and Max are bored, director Miller returns Max to his roots, a screaming chase sequence through a desertlike Australian landscape.", "Beyond Thunderdome is the third in George Miller's Mad Max series, and it closes the trilogy like a lightning blast followed by the ominous, resonant drone of thunder.", "There is something to get excited about in this third chapter of the Mad Max series: the powerhouse presence of Tina Turner.", "The directors, George Miller and George Ogilvie, borrow from every source they can find; movie buffs can pass the time spotting the Lynch shot, the Leone shot, the Jodorowski shot, and all kinds of others.", "The third in Mel Gibson's sci-fi series is the weakest, but it remains a hugely entertaining futuristic spectacular.", "Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome isn't a bad movie. It has entertaining sections, decent performances and more than a few provocative images. But it also has a major shortcoming: It's too darned sane.", "This infusion of money and production by a major studio gives the film a slightly more polished look, but is inferior to the previous two films in every other way.", "If \"Mad Max\" embraced a geneticist's acumen and \"The Road Warrior\" a philosopher's spirit, \"Thunderdome\" is about cold, hard economics - not just in Bartertown's transactions but the market expectations that come with the receipt of studio funding.", "An astonishing display of virtuoso cinema that is destined to take its place among the most vivid and freshly imagined fist-to-groin contests in the medium's history.", "Miller never falls back on the formulas that have become the bane of too many recent action films, and his sustained cuts lend a clarity to the proceedings.", "Disjointed but it still rocks.", "Quality, visionary sci-fi.", "", "The performances are superb.
