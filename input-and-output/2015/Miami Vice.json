{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A case involving drug lords and murder in South Florida takes a personal turn for undercover detectives Sonny Crockett (Colin Farrell) and Ricardo Tubbs (Jamie Foxx).

A mediocre, mildly entertaining, clich\u00e9d action film, about drugs and police?", "Foxx and Farrell seem slightly out of place both as undercover drug runners and as police officers.", "A good movie full of ups and downs, with excellent portions of great action cinema. [Full Review in Spanish]", "A very good movie, totally respectful to the television series. [Full Review in Spanish]", "One of the great American movies of the new millenium, and, quite simply, the most sensuous action movie I've ever seen.", "Miami Vice may be entertaining, but it's far from perfect.", "The film will have Mann fans applauding his decision to axe the pastels and neon of the TV series for a harder attitude and updated style, though others may not be so forgiving of the unintelligible dialogue and lack of ending.", "You come away with your head full of images, and ready to go back for more.", "So solemn and straight-faced is this violent expansion of the old show, under the precise, glossy and macho directing hand of the series' creator Michael Mann, that it skirts awfully close at times to unintentional self-parody.", "Mann does deserve credit for wanting to do something new with the material. It's just too bad he spent so much time making changes in costuming, art direction, soundtrack and character, only to turn around and tell the same old story.", "Here, both stars are flat, hampered by cheesy dialogue, dark sunglasses and a by-the-book drama that gives them little to do. When in doubt, they simply look mean and bored.", "A deadly serious, stylishly noirish, but fundamentally insubstantial thriller.", "My heart, which was beating an optimistic pit-a-pat as the lights were dimmed, had slowed to energy-saving mode after the first few minutes.", "Miami Vice is a movie made by a man whose mastery of the medium, and whose obsessive concerns for detail, put images of uncommon distinction on the big screen.", "We've all met great-looking people who can't manage to string a complete sentence together. Well, meet the movie equivalent.", "[Mann] revels in orchestrating confrontations between good and evil, unleashing the firepower with a merciless ferocity that Sam Peckinpah would admire.", "Everyone in this story, apart from our dissembling heroes, turns out to be exactly what they seem.", "Unlike the TV series, Miami Vice takes itself too seriously to be trashy -- and too seriously to be much fun either.", "It helps that everything is delivered with Mann's usual attention to visual style. As in his previous film, Collateral, digital shooting superbly captures the feel of a hot American city at night.", "It's hard to understand what anyone is actually saying in this film."], "rating": ["", "6/10", "", "", "5/5", "2.5/4", "2/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Mike Massie", "Juan Luis Caviaro", "Alberto Abu\u00edn", "PJ Nabarro", "Matthew Lucas", "Alan Jones", "Michael Wood", "Dennis King", "Rick Kisonak", "Alexi Morrissey", "Derek Malcolm", "Olivia Glazebrook", "Joe Morgenstern", "Leah Rozen", "Michael Dwyer", "Anthony Quinn", "Jonathan Romney", "Edward Porter", "Dorothy Woodend"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Review of Books", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seven Days", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Pittsburgh City Paper", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Irish Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent on Sunday", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sunday Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Tyee (British Columbia)"], "date": ["February 14, 2021", "November 21, 2020", "February 14, 2020", "February 14, 2020", "August 21, 2019", "June 5, 2019", "December 10, 2018", "December 10, 2018", "December 10, 2018", "December 10, 2018", "December 10, 2018", "December 10, 2018", "December 10, 2018", "December 9, 2018", "December 9, 2018", "December 9, 2018", "December 9, 2018", "December 9, 2018", "December 9, 2018", "August 23, 2017"]}}
