{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Charismatic British aristocrat and part-time shady art dealer Charlie Mortdecai (Johnny Depp) suffers from a constant lack of funds to support his lush lifestyle, so when Alistair Maitland (Ewan McGregor), a college friend and officer in MI5, asks him to find a stolen Goya painting, he accepts. But Charlie's not the only one with designs on the painting; an American heiress and a revolutionary want it too, for the artwork is rumored to contain the code to a bank account filled with Nazi gold.", "rating": "12", "genre": "Action & Adventure", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "David Koepp", "studio": "InfinitumNihil,LionsgateFilms,MadChance", "theater_date": "Jan 23, 2015", "dvd_date": "Jun 28, 2016", "box_office": "$7.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Capers flicks of a bygone era had a swingin', hip feel of controlled chaos not overplayed farce but Depp is pedal-to-the-metal, quirking-it-up in a display completely without charm and worse, without wit.", "Despite some visual pizzazz, a few adept verbal jousts, and a jazzy soundtrack, the vast majority of the film just isn't very funny.", "It's hard not to think that this is one project that looked a whole lot funnier on paper.", "Mortdecai is a scattershot comedy caper film ... destined to fall into that rotation of films you always see on cable networks and wonder if anyone is actually watching them.", "It was misguided at every junction.", "It was a low-rent Wes Anderson movie.", "As I said earlier, it isn't good enough or bad enough to even get a real reaction.", "Mortdecai is an okay film that will struggle to find a U.S. audience. A character is given a silly mustache to set the tone right away, and the tone in entirety is just that- silly.", "Depp's exaggerated mannerisms and affected speech are sure to infuriate his detractors and please those who enjoy his long line of goofy character creations.", "It doesn't take an expert in fine art to see that this is a cold, soulless knockoff of a true masterpiece.", "It tries way too hard, getting very few laughs out of a usually pretty reliable cast.", "Most caper comedies understand the need to pepper their expository scenes with sight gags. Nothing brings what should be a fun heist flick to a dead halt like two poorly lit actors sitting opposite each other reading out the plot scenario.", "I feel \"Mortdecai\" went into production on the sole premise of \"Johnny Depp wears a silly moustache,\" and people thought the poster would look funny, and at some point someone realized they needed a script.", "Mortdecai is just simply horrible", "The rarest kind of awful comedy, where even the characters themselves tangibly hate the movie they're in.", "The movie is a worthy warning to Hollywood at large: if you're going to make a comedy, hire some damn comedians.", "There's nothing worse than a film that's laughing at itself while the auditorium is silent, and while Mortdecai inspires a few chuckles, it never fully delivers.", "He's a character of a bygone age of literature and film plopped down into this time and place but with no realization that anything is different. All in all, you could certainly do a lot worse for a January release.", "I have seen worse films, but I'm not sure I've seen a worse performance.
