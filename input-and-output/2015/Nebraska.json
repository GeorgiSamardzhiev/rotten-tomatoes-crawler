So when Woody receives receives a sweepstakes notice in the mail and insists on making a 750-mile trip to Lincoln, Neb., to collect his prize, it falls to baffled son David (Will Forte) to accompany him. During a stop in their Nebraska hometown, word gets out about Woody's fortune, first making him a hero, then later, the target of predatory people.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "Alexander Payne", "studio": "BlueLakeMediaFund,BonaFideProductions,FilmNationEntertainment,ParamountVantage", "theater_date": "Nov 15, 2013", "dvd_date": "Nov 8, 2015", "box_office": "$17.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A plain spoken but lyrical black-and-white film about a man grasping at a last chance for a legacy.", "Dern delivers a fine performance (a considerable distance away from ruthlessly killing John Wayne).", "Alexander Payne has crafted a film that doesn't feel like a film.", "Despite its shortcomings, Nebraska offers much to grant it a strong recommendation, mainly for Payne's largely mature and unflinching look at the dusty underside of the American Dream.", "The plot of this is really simple yet believable, making it easy to care about the situation - all of which is made better by the subtle performances of its cast.", "Nebraska is Payne's fourth consecutive \"reflections on an average white male life while on the road\" film.", "It droops in the middle and veers off into sticky sentimentality by its third act, but Nebraska is still able to retain a solid charm.", "Nebraska is a bleak view of contemporary America but also a loving one.", "I went into Nebraska, hopeful but cautious. But in this film [Alexander] Payne seems to be going not sideways, but backwards.", "An authentic pathos is extracted with great skill from in between the constant jabbing notation of gesture and attitude and manners; which is to say that Payne seems a true comic artist of the oldest and most deadly serious kind.", "A deeply personal, emotionally resonant and -- let's not forget -- richly entertaining road movie with several award-worthy performances.", "Nebraska is a slow-burning heart-warmer that neatly dodges the cornball bullet of a climactic manly hug.", "Squibb's performance is the perfect way to sum up the film: This movie could easily have been overly sentimental, but instead has a refreshing amount of honesty that makes it memorable.", "No splashy, sentimental performances. No outrageous plot twists. No CGI. Just regular folks reckoning with their circumstances, quietly, with dignity, and suffused with director Alexander Payne's signature dry wit.", "One of the most pictorially concentric American films of recent years.", "What is interesting about Nebraska is its feel, staged more like a play than a movie, which should leave fans of Payne's pleasantly surprised.", "Nebraska lacks the sourness that permeates the likes of Sideways and The Descendants, trading it in for straight deadpan, to better and more lasting effect. This is a terrific movie.", "Overall, the film is as gray and hopeless as the landscape.", "The story is simple but perfectly executed, the cast all provide stellar work, and the film's message about family and dreams is wonderfully poignant.", "The movie's final act may be too sentimental for fans of Payne's satire, but that's what worked for me."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "7/10", "3.5/4", "4/5", "4/5", "B-", "3/5", "5/5", "", "", "4/5", "", "B+", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "5/10", "9.5/10", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "David Harris", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Ryan Syrek", "Christopher Preston", "Alexa Dalby", "Ren Jender", "Geoffrey O&#39;Brien", "Daniel Green", "J.
