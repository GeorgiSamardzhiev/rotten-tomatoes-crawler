{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When God decides that mankind has become too sinful and must be wiped off the Earth, he chooses Noah (Russell Crowe), a pious man, for a great task. Noah must build an ark large enough to hold his wife (Jennifer Connelly), adopted daughter (Emma Watson), sons (Logan Lerman, Douglas Booth, Leo McHugh Carroll) and their wives -- plus breeding pairs of every animal. When the task is completed, Noah and his family witness God's wrath in the form of an apocalyptic flood.", "rating": "76", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h 17m", "director": "Darren Aronofsky", "studio": "DisruptionEntertainment,ParamountPictures,RegencyEnterprises,ProtozoaPictures", "theater_date": "Mar 28, 2014", "dvd_date": "Apr 9, 2016", "box_office": "$101.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A thought-provoking take on a familiar story that will keep you guessing until the end credits roll.", "It's a film that makes one think and feel and, yes, wonder.", "The film is a visceral spectacle in Darren Aronofsky's catalog.
