{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Clumsy Monsieur Hulot (Jacques Tati) finds himself perplexed by the intimidating complexity of a gadget-filled Paris. He attempts to meet with a business contact but soon becomes lost. His roundabout journey parallels that of an American tourist (Barbara Dennek), and as they weave through the inventive urban environment, they intermittently meet, developing an interest in one another. They eventually get together at a chaotic restaurant, along with several other quirky characters.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Jacques Tati", "studio": "JollyFilm,SpectaFilms", "theater_date": "Jun 27, 1973", "dvd_date": "Mar 23, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There is not a written description of the film that would ever begin to do it justice, but it happens to be one of those rare, supremely unique and utterly mind boggling examples of cinematic possibilities.", "An even more remarkable Rube Goldbergian contraption of visual comedy that turns all Paris into an ultramodern advertisement for itself. Its brilliance requires almost no dialogue...", "The sheer complexity of each scene must have taken a tremendous amount of coordination and planning, and yet it feels so alive.", "Playtime, [Jacques Tati's] masterpiece, is a work of brow-furrowing complexity in its design and structure, but a model of narrative clarity.", "The whimsical comedy of coincidence and confusion is a delight.", "[Tati's] most recent films, at least for me, have had the effect of seeming endless and pointless, interspersed with four or five bits that are not only choice but even classic.", "[Tati's] unparalleled mise-en-scene stuffs the frame with enough energy to save a Paris power outage.", "Playtime is fairly described as a masterpiece of slapstick comedy, but the more I see it, the more I feel it's a 124 minute nightmare of modern life.", "Playtime is not a Hulot excursion but a lengthy look at the Americanised Paris of le drugstore and le parking-with, Tati being Tati.", "... an accumulation of minor touches, little dissonances, imaginative observations, and pieces of creative business: hundreds of details that erupt with lives of their own but fit together like a clockwork mechanism with a human heartbeat.", "Tati's despair is modulated by a sense of wonder.", "Jacques Tati's Playtime is an astringent antidote to Paris movies that are as sickly as macaroons and stuffed with views of the Eiffel Tower by night.", "It took Jacques Tati close to ten years to realise his greatest achievement, but it left him virtually broke. No wonder.", "For my money Playtime is the greatest film ever made.", "Jacques Tati's 1967 masterpiece still holds up as a feast of subtle sight gags, playful noise and, above all, visual wonders.", "PlayTime is a work of unparalleled genius.", "For all the overweening ambition there's an intimate charm about it ...", "Playtime...is...a minor entry in 1960s international cinema, and yet it's also one of the era's great films,", "This film delivers exactly what its title promises. It's a panoramic frenzy of elaborate sights and sound design.", "Tati is constantly fiddling with his images, constructing sets and placing his camera in exactly the right place to execute a visual transformation of space."], "rating": ["5/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "4/5", "A", "8.5/10", "A"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "Dennis Harvey", "Allen Almachar", "Pamela Hutchinson", "Dick Lochte", "Bernard Drew", "Asher Luberto", "Pat Padua", "Penelope Houston", "Sean Axmaker", "Richard Brody", "Kate Muir", "Ronald Bergan", "David Jenkins", "Dave Calhoun", "Noel Murray", "Philip Kemp", "Andy Crump", "Jeffrey Overstreet", "Bryant Frazer"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">48 Hills", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Silent London", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Free Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gannett News Service", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">culturevulture.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seanax.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Little White Lies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dissolve", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Mezzanine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Looking Closer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bryant Frazer&#39;s Deep Focus"], "date": ["November 3, 2020", "November 3, 2020", "July 17, 2020", "March 27, 2020", "December 17, 2019", "October 2, 2019", "June 11, 2019", "August 28, 2018", "July 11, 2018", "January 13, 2017", "March 2, 2015", "November 7, 2014", "November 7, 2014", "November 6, 2014", "November 4, 2014", "November 3, 2014", "November 3, 2014", "August 7, 2014", "May 18, 2010", "August 26, 2009"]}}
