{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When the mayor of a crime-ridden city loosens the restrictions on entering the police academy in order to get more cops on the street, all manner of oddball characters enlist to join the force. Among the cadets are suave Carey Mahoney (Steve Guttenberg), hulking Moses Hightower (Bubba Smith), beautiful Karen Thompson (Kim Cattrall) and sound effects-generating Larvell Jones (Michael Winslow), who all have to show initiative and courage when they are faced with tough situations out on patrol.", "rating": "55", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Hugh Wilson", "studio": "WarnerBros.,LaddCompany", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2009", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's a collection of easy laughs, no brain required.", "Police Academy is the most uproarious film to come along in years. You have the right to remain silent, but you can't help bt laugh out loud.", "A big hoot for adolescents of all ages.", "The movie is generally good-natured and, for this kind of thing, tasteful. Nobody should be arrested because of it, anyway.", "It all plays like a made-for-TV film with some nudity and scatological humor thrown in, but it made a bunch of money.", "While the follow-ups became increasingly puerile as the series went on, the original film produced its fair share of belly laughs.", "Police Academy is a dumb-funny movie that succeeds by virtue of sheer invention.", "Now comes without any doubt the absolute pits of this genre, the least funny movie that could possibly have been inspired by Airplane! or any other movie.", "The movie had its moment in the sun, somebody made a lot of money from it and then it vanished. Mercifully so in most ways, but not without leaving at least a little whiff of younger, happier days behind.", "Sophomoric '80's cop-spoof has profanity, sex, stereotypes.", "Police Academy at its core is a harmless, innocent poke at authority that does find a fresh background in a police academy.", "The hit-and-mostly-miss humour proves so cringeworthy, however, your real amazement will be reserved for that fact that they sprang six sequels and three different TV series out of this.", "", "", "Funny! Funny! Funny!", "Goofy group makes 'Car 54 Where Are You?' seem like Shakespeare.", "A tasteless comedy.", "A Reagan-era screed against affirmative action, Police Academy warns what misfits and lowlifes wait to pour through the floodgates.", "It's harmless stuff, to be sure, but almost invisible, it disappears from memory so fast. A stealth comedy, perhaps?", "You know how people talk about a movie being so bad it's good?
