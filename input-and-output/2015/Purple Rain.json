{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A victim of his own anger, the Kid (Prince) is a Minneapolis musician on the rise with his band, the Revolution, escaping a tumultuous home life through music. While trying to avoid making the same mistakes as his truculent father (Clarence Williams III), the Kid navigates the club scene and a rocky relationship with a captivating singer, Apollonia (Apollonia Kotero). But another musician, Morris (Morris Day), looks to steal the Kid's spotlight -- and his girl.", "rating": "70", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts/Romance", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Albert Magnoli", "studio": "PurpleFilms,WarnerBros.", "theater_date": "Jul 27, 1984", "dvd_date": "Jan 15, 2008", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Not much about Purple Rain should work - and yet everything does.", "Transcendent music can cover a multitude of sins...", "Purple Rain became a generational manifesto, while providing the largest megaphone yet for one of the greatest geniuses in pop music.", "Perhaps the grossly simplistic and unsubtle misogyny in young people's movies and videos is less damaging than polished acting would be.", "The performances and score take it to another level, and as absurd as he is, Morris Day is, in a way, the glue holding this thing together...", "The live performances are dope...even The Time! However, the treatment of women was a bit abysmal, though at the time it was acceptable...the movie itself is entertaining.", "At once atrocious and awesome, featuring musical performances so sublime you instantly forgive that the rest is so ridiculous.", "Even those who aren't Prince fans are likely to be captivated by its energy, enamored with its simple, often poignant storyline.", "Catharsis on the cheap; there's no reason to accept the pretense that the hero has suffered much and changed for the better unless you're predisposed to get swoony over Prince himself.", "The film is a love letter to collaboration, to passion, and to the power of music: this is Prince's legacy, brought to life nowhere more memorably than in Purple Rain.", "As a debut and a savvy statement of personal enterprise, Purple Rain is quite an accomplishment. As a film, moreover, it is precisely the sort of vehicle one would have wished for Elvis in his Hollywood heyday.", "The drama is clunky, the acting is awful more often than not, and the casual sexism simmers throughout. But whenever Prince takes the stage to perform one of his sizzling songs, the picture irresistibly exudes sex, sweat and swagger in equal measure.", "Prince's rock musical-drama has lots of sex, profanity.", "A viewer's response to the movie will probably relate directly to how much the viewer likes Prince to begin with.", "The music is lively, loud, often powerful, sometimes raunchy, yet full of unexpected subtleties and nuances. The staging is frenetic but as perfect as the machines of the art can produce. This is first class music video.", "Rock star Prince makes an impressive feature film debut in Purple Rain, a rousing contemporary addition to the classic backstage musical genre.", "The less said about the lead performances the better, although Morris Day eclipses the star with a charismatic turn, but Prince and the Revolution were at the height of their powers.", "For Prince fans, this movie will be a must for videocassette purchase, but even they will have to deal with the sexist way women are treated by all the film's male characters.", "Simplistic, superficial and surprisingly sentimental, Purple Rain is everything Prince's music is not.", "Prince's 1984 movie debut seems more like his deification, with an aggressively stupid plot line that serves only to set him up as a paragon of artistic integrity, sexual prowess, and superhuman sensitivity."], "rating": ["9/10", "2.5/4", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "3/4", "2/5", "", "", "", "3/5", "2/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Sean Collier", "Josh Larsen", "Eric Deggans", "Pat Gowens", "Justin Brown", "Brandon Collins", "Sean Burns", "Duane Byrge", "Gary Arnold", "Alexandra Heller-Nicholas", "Cynthia Rose", "Matt Brunson", "Barbara Shulgasser", "Roger Catlin", "Ted Mahar", "Cynthia Kirk", "John Ferguson", "", "Ralph Novak", "Dave Kehr"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Box Office Prophets", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">NPR", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sojourner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Medium Popcorn", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Medium Popcorn", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The ARTery", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">sbs.com.au", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Monthly Film Bulletin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Omaha World-Herald", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Oregonian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader"], "date": ["September 28, 2020", "March 26, 2020", "November 28, 2019", "August 21, 2019", "July 15, 2019", "July 15, 2019", "May 30, 2019", "August 7, 2018", "April 23, 2018", "May 11, 2017", "February 22, 2017", "October 8, 2016", "June 28, 2016", "April 21, 2016", "April 21, 2016", "April 21, 2016", "April 21, 2016", "April 21, 2016", "April 21, 2016", "April 21, 2016"]}}
