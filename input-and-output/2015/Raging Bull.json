{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The story of a middleweight boxer as he rises through ranks to earn his first shot at the middleweight crown. He falls in love with a gorgeous girl from the Bronx. The inability to express his feelings enters into the ring and eventually takes over his life.

Robert De Niro's work here is inspiring. [Full review in Spanish]", "Raging Bull may very well be the film that saved Scorsese's life.", "Scripters Paul Schrader and Mardik Martin would have you believe LaMotta spent most of his life either throwing punches or yelling his head off at whoever was nearby. In short, La Motta's life hardly warrants screen treatment.", "Raging Bull is wonderfully made and features one of the all-time greatest performances, but I feel like I'm missing the point.", "The film pushes somewhat of a limited thesis, especially compared to Scorsese's superior existential portraits in Mean Streets, Taxi Driver, and The Last Temptation of Christ.", "It is worth mentioning Robert De Niro's performance. His way around the ring and his transformation after his character retires are nothing short of incredible. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Raging Bull moves with a feverish rhythm and brandishes an obsessive style.", "Scorsese goes overboard in an attempt at low-keyed naturalism, however, and there is little dramatic structure to the biographical overview... But there's no denying the power and artistry of De Niro's performance.", "This is a masterpiece. It proves that a film can have violent undertones and overtones, but still illuminate and comment upon violence in a moving, poetic and profound way.", "This is, I suppose, a film about a slob, a violent and stupid man whose few brains are knocked even further sideways every time he enters the ring. But, somehow, he becomes intriguing in the telling.", "From this disastrous and brutal history, Martin Scorsese has made a brutal, discerning and bleakly beautiful picture.", "Martin Scorsese's obsession with a dubious mystique of masculinity turns \"Raging Bull\" into a ponderous work of metaphysical cinematic bull.", "It's certainly bruising to watch, thanks both to the ferocity of its fight scenes and the violent misogyny of its protagonist. This is a film that doesn't pull any punches when it comes to portraying machismo.", "\"Raging Bull\" ultimately has a numbing effect on the brain as if one's head had been pummeled by La Motta's so-called \"girlish\" fists.", "endlessly compelling", "The other night, my wife and I sat down to watch the new 30th Anniversary Blu-ray edition of Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull. I could scarcely believe it's been three decades since...", "Raging Bull is a fascinating exploration of the mind of an emotionally disconnected man. It's brutal, crass and impossible to look away -- much like a real boxing match.", "When has a performer as fully and uniquely sacrificed himself to the moving-picture cause as De Niro?", "Scorsese might never again find a subject as ideal as Jake LaMotta, the Bronx-based boxer whose public bouts and private demons Raging Bull chronicles with such bruising acuity."], "rating": ["7/10", "4.5/5", "", "2/4", "3.5/5", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "4/5", "", "1", "5/5", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Fico Cangiano", "Allen Almachar", "Larry Vitacco", "Matt Neal", "PJ Nabarro", "Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos", "Lawrence O&#39;Toole", "Ron Pennington", "Bruce McCabe", "Peter Ackroyd", "Robert Hatch", "Gary Arnold", "Jason Best", "Kathleen Carroll", "Kevin Carr", "Leonard Maltin", "R.L.
