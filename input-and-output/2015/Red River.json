{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Headstrong Thomas Dunson (John Wayne) starts a thriving Texas cattle ranch with the help of his faithful trail hand, Groot (Walter Brennan), and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Matt Garth (Montgomery Clift), an orphan Dunson took under his wing when Matt was a boy. In need of money following the Civil War, Dunson and Matt lead a cattle drive to Missouri, where they will get a better price than locally, but the crotchety older man and his willful young partner begin to butt heads on the exhausting journey.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Western", "runtime": "2h 13m", "director": "Howard Hawks", "studio": "MontereyProductions", "theater_date": "Sep 30, 1948", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Although there's a touch of excitement at the start, the film seems to exist primarily as a history lesson rather than a piece of adventurous entertainment.", "Red River contains everything a western should have and throws in a few things more.", "Red River, as a comment on frontier courage, loyalty, and leadership, is a romantic, simple-minded mush, but an ingeniously lyrical film nonetheless.", "It is a rattling good outdoor adventure movie.", "The best westerns always undercut their own myths, and few are more gorgeously conflicted than Red River.", "Wayne is an offbeat presence in River. His longish hair and loose gait - the latter usually indicating a relaxed sense of power - now imply a man out of his place, and a kind of restlessness.", "Just when loyalty seems to be an entirely perverse and oppressive force in this world of might makes right, the film (shows) there are limits decent men won't cross.", "inaugurated the second, more intriguing half of John Wayne's career, enabling him to be cast in roles that were more than just macho posturing and gruff heroism", "It was Hawks' genius to recognize a kinship between his leads, and to understand that the 'naturalism' of the Wayne persona was as deep and complex as the more intellectualized approach of the neurotic young New York stage actor, Clift.", "Hawks directs the film with his typical assurance and seeming lack of fuss, letting scenes play out in long takes, and framing the action against vistas that often dwarf the actors.", "[VIDEO ESSAY] The homosexual subtext in Howard Hawkes's 1948 western is a widely overlooked, yet unmistakable element, to one of the most popular examples of the genre.", "The staging of physical conflict is deadly, equalling anything yet seen on the screen.", "Howard Hawks stages the definitive cow opera with beautiful, lyrical, exciting sequences of stampeding, rough weather, cowboying and Indian skirmishes.", "Of the may big names involved in the making of Red River, few made greater films.", "", "A grand, sprawling tale of the civilizing of the west.", "This brilliant Hawks Western, one of the decade's best, has been interpreted in different ways, but at its core is the contrast between John Wayne's and Montgomery Clift's leadership style and perception of manhood.", "Hawks never did anything self-consciously. You always realize how great his films are after you're through enjoying yourself.", "Immaculately shot by Russell Harlan, perfectly performed by a host of Hawks regulars, and shot through with dark comedy, it's probably the finest Western of the '40s.", ""], "rating": ["7/10", "", "", "", "", "1", "8/10", "3.5/4", "4/4", "5/5", "A", "", "5/5", "", "4/5", "3.5/5", "A", "4/4", "", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Bob Thomas", "Manny Farber", "James Agee", "Annie Wagner", "Matthew Sorrento", "Christopher Long", "James Kendrick", "John Beifuss", "Keith Phipps", "Cole Smithey", "", "", "", "Cole Smithey", "Michael W.
