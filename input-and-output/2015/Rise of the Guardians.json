It falls to a winter sprite named Jack Frost (Chris Pine) to thwart Pitch's plans and save the Guardians from destruction.", "rating": "75", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Animation/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Peter Ramsey", "studio": "DreamWorksAnimation", "theater_date": "Nov 21, 2012", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$103.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Rise of the Guardians isn't a masterpiece, but it's an enjoyable film and very well suited for this time of year.", "As a movie geared for the entire family, this fires on all cylinders, from the exquisitely detailed animation to the thought-out character development.", "[Rise of the Guardians] invokes a charm and sweetness that is different to other animated films out there.", "I'm sure [it] will be a big hit, and kids will eat it up. But as much as I might try to simulate their point of view, I can only see it through my own battered eyeballs, which feel like they've aged 10 years in the 90 minutes spent watching it.", "If you don't enjoy this you probably don't like Christmas", "It's one of [Dreamworks'] best animated films for sure.", "This erratic flurry of light and colour is made more than bearable thanks to a script full of real warmth and a collection of incredibly well drawn characters who truly capture the magic of childhood wonder.", "Rise of the Guardians is blithe and lovely, smart and funny. It's an honest-to-goodness family film that can be enjoyed by both kids and adults.", "While Rise isn't destined to be a new holiday classic...its a mostly well-crafted film with an excellent cast and a dizzying array of visual treats.", "Rise of the Guardians has some great concepts, but ultimately needed a much more original story to make it seem more like the fresh idea it genuinely is.", "While the heroes of DreamWorks' film claim to be the guardians of childhood, their tattooed, hoodied posturing actually diminishes it.", "Some of the best animation I've seen in quite some time.", "Charming, sweet and enchanting, but not without its flaws, Rise of the Guardians is the hopeful, feel-good movie for kids that's fitting for holiday movie watching with the family.", "[Rise of the Guardians] acknowledges the courage of children and teaches the audience to see the signs and symbols of life more deeply and to listen to good inspiration.", "Just interesting and colorful enough to hold a child's attention for 90 minutes but a thundering bore for anyone that's been around the cinematic block.", "The film has a square-jawed elegance that occasionally hits a note of grandeur when it's not just being silly.", "Energetic animation and a handful of amusing character touches help, but they can't compensate for the paper-thin story and muddled messages.", "A beautiful fantasy adventure that might change a few minds about the power and importance of these childhood fantasy characters.", "DreamWorks' newest picture is definitely one for the kids, but director Peter Ramsey makes it fun enough to put a smile on parents' faces.", "An entertaining experience, whether you see it in 3-D or 2-D, 'Rise of the Guardians' is an enjoyable adventure for all ages."], "rating": ["3.0/4", "A-", "3.5/5", "", "4/5", "8/10", "3/5", "B+", "7/10", "7.5/10", "", "", "B", "", "2/5", "", "", "3.5/4", "3/4", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Brian D.
