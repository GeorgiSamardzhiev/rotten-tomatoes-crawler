And here's my advice to him: Don't quit your day job. You're good at it, and it serves the movie.", "In the final reel, the tone suddenly shifts from laughs to a deliberately quirky romance that feels forced and, worse, doesn't work.", "Comedian Adam Carolla mines his own career experiences to amusing effect in his semi-autobiographical dark comedy about an embittered stand-up comic.", "...even when Carolla is on-stage and performing with some type of emotional subtext, this definitely ain't Lenny.", "Road Hard has enough spiky moments to make it worth a watch.", "The man who made girls jump on trampolines delivers better rom-coms than the rest of Hollywood.", "Carolla, who co-wrote and co-directed the picture with Kevin Henchis, has a way of making his remarkably stiff screen presence endearing. He plays Bruce with gentle self-mockery and a touch of genuine pathos.", "This feature directing debut for Adam Carolla and frequent writing/producing collaborator Kevin Hench is an amiable, nicely assembled semi-autobiographical fiction that will please the former's fans.", "The truth is, I found \"Road Hard\" to be a low-key gem, a consistently funny albeit conventional story about a guy who's almost always the funniest person in the room, and is almost always his own worst enemy.", "Mr. Carolla's wide-ranging rsum includes writing, voice-over work, talk-show appearances and a popular podcast, but it's light on acting, and he shows why here ...", "Jokes, anger and sentimentality mix uneasily in comedian Adam Carolla's directorial debut (with co-writer Kevin Hench), \"Road Hard.\"", "You can make a movie that's both sweet and crass; just look at Judd Apatow's comedies. But the mix doesn't work here, maybe because both the vulgarity and the cheesiness are so amped up.", "Much of the character's angst comes off as celebrity whining.", "The type of saccharine, predictable movie Carolla has spent his entire career making fun of.", "The movie has its own integrity. It's about something, a particular world, and Carolla knows what he's talking about.", "Supporting turns by Philip Rosenthal and David Alan Grier as two pals in the business are fun, but they can't prevent the movie's rather aimless nature or self-indulgent feel.", "Comedy plus tragedy equals boredom in Adam Carolla's crowdfunded star vehicle."], "rating": ["", "3/5", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "2/4", "", "1/4", "3/5", "3/4", "2.5/4", "", "3.5", "", "", "1.5/4", "", "C-", "2/4", "2.5/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Jonathan Kiefer", "Glenn Sumi", "Brad Wheeler", "Chris Knight", "Linda Barnard", "Frank Scheck", "Nick Allen", "Jeffrey M.
