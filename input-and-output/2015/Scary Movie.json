{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Defying the very notion of good taste, Scary Movie out-parodies the pop culture parodies with a no-holds barred assault on the most popular images and talked-about moments from recent films, television and commercials. The film boldly fires barbs at the classic scenes from \"Scream,\" \"The Sixth Sense,\" \"The Matrix,\" \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\" and \"The Blair Witch Project,\" then goes on to mock a whole myriad of teen movie clich\u00e9s, no matter the genre.", "rating": "52", "genre": "Comedy/Horror", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Keenen Ivory Wayans", "studio": "WayanBros.Entertainment,Miramax,Gold/MillerProductions,DimensionFilms,Brillstein-GreyEntertainment", "theater_date": "Jul 7, 2000", "dvd_date": "Jan 20, 2016", "box_office": "$157.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Scary Movie is terrible.

And for the first 20 minutes, they do. After that the gag-rate plummets, and it's a long haul to the credits.", "I laughed some at Scary Movie, but I came away from it feeling dirty.", "mindless fun", "", "This movie will only frighten you with its crudeness.", "", "Ends up being less funny than its primary target, the already-self-satirizing Scream series.", "", "The appeal seems to lie less in laughter than in respect for the filmmakers' irreverence as viewers sit back and think, \"I can't believe they showed that!\"", "If you're hoping to forget your troubles for 90 minutes, Scary Movie certainly does the job.", "Does its spoofing with a blunt instrument instead of a scalpel, and it's engineered to appeal to the lowest instincts of its targeted adolescent audiences.", "Scary Movie's humor is definitely in the gutter.", "The humor in this movie is based on the concept that if enough jokes are fired off in a row, some of them will make you laugh. The concept works.", "", "The kind of thing that leads to sleepless nights -- from severely bruised rib cages.", "Scary Movie is a sporadically hilarious parody of teen horror movies that too frequently seems half-baked.", "Make no mistake -- this one is lowbrow comedy all the way."], "rating": ["1/5", "", "", "", "", "C+", "B", "1/5", "B", "2/4", "2/5", "", "3/4", "D", "2/5", "3/4", "1/4", "2.5/4", "B-", "2/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Tony Black", "Paul Tatara", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Peter Bradshaw", "Stuart Klawans", "John A.
