It's a cultural phenomenon. As a movie, it's only so-so. As an event-it's terrific.", "No, it doesn't break new ground, but it does know its own ground perfectly.", "... the movie was truly gratifying and fed our SATC appetite, at least until the sequel coming up (can't wait!).", "The ladies settle into the doldrums of marriage and their antics are reduced to a detached series of scenes that involve sulking, yearning or just plain indulging.", "", "Ultimately, it's this streak of realism that prevents Sex And The City from becoming just another fluffy New York fairytale.", "As amigas de Sex and the City est\u00e3o entre as criaturas da fic\u00e7\u00e3o mais repulsivas que j\u00e1 conheci: f\u00fateis, est\u00fapidas, ego\u00edstas e entediantes.

'It's Star Trek for women.'...", "The movie Sex and the City is a heady female fantasy -- I think. I tried to snuggle up to Sex and the City, but the attempt to snuggle for two hours and 20 minutes is in itself a fantasy. Like many typical men, I'm afraid I fell asleep.", "The behemoth 145-minute running time for this lightweight romantic comedy is unforgivable, and that's only the first of this movie's problems.", "Reliving the fantasy lush life.", "I went in rooting for SATC with everything I had, and it left me a bit disappointed.", "Wouldn't it be redundant to describe the self-indulgent big-screen adaptation as similarly vapid, pointless, and poorly acted as the popular HBO show upon which it is based?", "Cinerina invites her first guest reviewer, Melanie Treco.
