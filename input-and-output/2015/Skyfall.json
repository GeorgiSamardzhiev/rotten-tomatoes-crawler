{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When James Bond's (Daniel Craig) latest assignment goes terribly wrong, it leads to a calamitous turn of events: Undercover agents around the world are exposed, and MI6 is attacked, forcing M (Judi Dench) to relocate the agency. With MI6 now compromised inside and out, M turns to the one man she can trust: Bond. Aided only by a field agent (Naomie Harris), Bond takes to the shadows and follows a trail to Silva (Javier Bardem), a man from M's past who wants to settle an old score.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 23m", "director": "Sam Mendes", "studio": "EonProductionsLtd.", "theater_date": "Nov 9, 2012", "dvd_date": "Feb 4, 2017", "box_office": "$304.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The latest in 007's adventures is so far removed from the super spy's typical assignments that it often feels like only a hollow shell of the iconic hero.", "Ben Whishaw is a blast as the nerdish gadget dude who keeps Bond well equipped.", "Skyfall in a nutshell - respecting the past and yet ensuring that Bond lasts for another 50 years.", "The most personal Bond story since \"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\".", "Rather than being a simple 'resurrection', it is the reinvention of 007. [Full review in Spanish]", "Skyfall may not be an existential masterpiece, but it is a near perfect action thriller that features an excellent cast highlighted by a performance that should rank Raoul Silva as one of the best Bond villains of all time...", "Mendes takes the bold extra step of challenging action audiences.", "Thrilling, smart yet slightly overlong, Skyfall is more than a film - it is a statement. Welcome back, Mr Bond.", "The character of Bond always works best when a blank canvas of nihilist tendencies and ultra-professionalism, so the Batman-style stab at populist pathos didn't wash with me.", "'Skyfall' remains a powerful film, of immaculate and superb accomplishment, of inspired performances. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Skyfall is a tad leaner on action, but it's certainly incredibly meaty on plot, glued together with the perfectly pitched tone and mood, and delivered with some delectable cinematography.", "The script, by Neal Purvis, Robert Wade and John Logan, is a study in contrast and pacing.", "A hugely entertaining adventure that takes Bond into previously uncharted territory, giving us everything we have come to expect from the 007 films and more.", "You get some sizzling cinematography and Craig delivering a very good performance as Bond. He has evolved into the role quite well, giving Bond a darker, harder edge while showing a vulnerability that hasn't been explored before.", "The result of [Mendes'] collaboration with the screenwriters and cast, particularly Craig and Dench, is that Skyfall comes off largely as its own movie rather than simply the latest entry in a famous franchise.", "A different kind of Bond, Craig gives a more intense and realistic feel to the character.", "The result is a weightier Bond film -- with all of the wit and fun left intact.", "Skyfall is the Bond flick for the ages that resurrects whatever stagnation Agent 007's previous exploits may have encountered in less-than-stellar stretches. After all folks he's Bond...James Bond!", "There's just a gripping story and a tremendously talented cast.
