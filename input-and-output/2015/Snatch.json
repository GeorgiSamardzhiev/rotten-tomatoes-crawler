When Mickey does not throw his first fight as agreed, an infuriated Brick Top demands another match. Meanwhile, gangster Frankie Four Fingers (Benicio Del Toro) comes to place a bet for a friend with Brick Top's bookies, as multiple criminals converge on a stolen diamond that Frankie has come to London to sell.", "rating": "73", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Guy Ritchie", "studio": "ColumbiaPictures,SKAFilms", "theater_date": "Jan 19, 2001", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$30.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It is unquestionable that the script and direction are of an impressive level that places the filmmaker as one of the most eloquent writers and brightest narrators that emerged from the perfidious Albi\u00f3n in the last two decades.

And now for something completely different, please.", "An entertaining romp of a crime caper flick that wants to be funny more than it wants to be dangerous or mysterious.", "Eccentric characters, lively banter, adults only.", "Snatch uses and abuses the template of its breakthrough predecessor, elevates it, and delivers an equal, if not better, version of a film we have all seen before, yet much better the second time around.", "Of the ensemble, only Pitt truly shows his class, delivering an amusing yet emotive performance amongst a group of actors who -- at best -- are pandering to laddish culture.", "Ritchie may be skilled at generating controlled chaos, but his surprise-a-minute strategy ultimately holds no surprises.", "It's a twisting, witty, and wise crime-boxing story about the hunt for a huge diamond and a prizefighter who can't take a fall.", "Ritchie's follow-up to Lock, Stock is an even more craftily concocted underworld entertainment, helped no end by the casting of Pitt as the bare-knuckle boxer Mickey.", "...an ideal follow-up to writer/director Guy Ritchie's debut effort, Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels.", "Snatch is a full-throttle comedic crime caper that more than resembles Lock, Stock... yet remains a rollicking good time in its own right.", "", "Madonna's husband is a dervish in the editing room, and he's not ashamed to have nicked most of the conventions of American noir.", "Fortunately, the drop in entertainment value from one Ritchie film to the next isn't as steep as the drop in originality.", "It's rather like the favorite pastime of this movie's villain ... throwing wild dogs into a pit and watching them fight until there's only one left standing.", "This is a swift, sharp picture that pleases the senses on all levels, ranging from the visual to the aural, the linguistic, and yes even the intellectual.", "There's just not a lot of fun to be had here. The plot is too convoluted, too filled with double-reversals and twists for us to turn our brains off, relax and watch Guy Ritchie's kinetic visual style.", "Snatch, while somewhat hard to follow, represents a fascinating study in character interaction and complex plot development.", ""], "rating": ["", "3/5", "", "7/10", "3/5", "4/5", "", "", "3/4", "", "3/4", "3.5/5", "4/5", "B-", "3/4", "D", "4.5/5", "D+", "4/5", "3.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "PJ Nabarro", "David Ansen", "James Plath", "M.
