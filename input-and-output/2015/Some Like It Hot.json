{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After witnessing a Mafia murder, slick saxophone player Joe (Tony Curtis) and his long-suffering buddy, Jerry (Jack Lemmon), improvise a quick plan to escape from Chicago with their lives. Disguising themselves as women, they join an all-female jazz band and hop a train bound for sunny Florida. While Joe pretends to be a millionaire to win the band's sexy singer, Sugar (Marilyn Monroe), Jerry finds himself pursued by a real millionaire (Joe E. Brown) as things heat up and the mobsters close in.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "2h", "director": "Billy Wilder", "studio": "UnitedArtists,AshtonProductions,MirischCompany", "theater_date": "Mar 1, 1959", "dvd_date": "Sep 26, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["\"Nobody's perfect\" indeed, but Some Like It Hot just about is.", "Features many spectacularly orchestrated sequences that take advantage of the role reversals, which aren't toned down as much as audiences might expect for a '50s movie.", "[The film] transcended itself to become something truly timeless.", "Some Like It Hot is another supersonic, breakneck, belly-laugh comedy that should be a block-busting bonanza at the box office.", "Genuine hilarity is gradually replaced by boredom and distaste as the one basic gag is stretched out thinner and thinner...", "A milestone comedy to watch again and again.", "Ultimately, it's the whole cast and crew's commitment to an idea that on its face seem so damn silly that makes it work so well.", "The film is an outrageous, hilarious, and amazingly unpretentious trip through a funhouse of sexual identities.", "The film's final line is legendary, though I have a soft spot for Jerry's description of a sashaying Sugar: \"Look at that! Look how she moves! That's just like Jell-O on springs!\"", "Some Like It Hot was released in 1959 but its effervescence and sparkle are timeless. I guarantee that it will make you laugh out loud.", "The pace is fast and the humour -- especially Mr Lemmon's -- is often hilarious. It is pleasant to meet again such old familiars as Mr Raft and Mr Brown; and Miss Monroe, as always, is irresistible.", "In terms of comic devices there is very little in the film that is original, but the use of the material is delightful.", "The perfect screwball comedy.", "The funniest comedy I've seen in years.", "\"Nobody's perfect\" is the last line. Wilder, Lemmon, Curtis and Monroe come pretty close.", "Fifty-five years old and still a comedy masterpiece.", "Everyone has a canonical classic which they just don't get. This one is mine.", "Brilliant performances, wondrous comic timing and the greatest pay-off line ever written: this one's still red hot.", "Here is one of those movies that persists beyond the implications of a mere time frame, resonating with audiences like a very fine wine.", "Re-viewing Some Like It Hot is invariably a rewarding experience, not because it is a great comedy but because it is a great movie."], "rating": ["5/5", "1", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "4/4", "4/4", "", "", "", "4/4", "4/4", "5/5", "5/5", "2/5", "5/5", "4/4", "1"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Matt Neal", "Mike Massie", "Allen Almachar", "Jack Moffitt", "Clyde Gilmour", "Sky Staff", "Todd Gilchrist", "Chris Cabin", "Matt Brunson", "Anupama Chopra", "Guardian Staff", "Stanley Kauffmann", "David N.
