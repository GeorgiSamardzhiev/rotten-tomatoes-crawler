{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the 23rd century, the Starship Enterprise is dispatched to the scene of a giant energy field about to engulf two ships. Capt. Kirk (William Shatner) averts calamity, but is exposed to the field and presumed dead. Years later, the Enterprise's new commander, Capt. Picard (Patrick Stewart), learns that one of the disaster's survivors, Dr. Soran (Malcolm McDowell), plans to enter the field by destroying a neighboring star. Picard now must collaborate with an unlikely ally in order to stop him.", "rating": "48", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 58m", "director": "David Carson", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "Nov 18, 1994", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$74.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's not merely a couple of episodes strung together; it's a surprisingly bland selection of possibly unused concepts from the show, fleshed out in an unspectacular fashion.", "Though not the worst of all the Trek movies, the stupefying Generations is easily the most disappointing, with the much-hyped Kirk-Picard team-up lasting all of 20 minutes.", "Three things make the film worthwhile: [William] Shatner's performance; the sequence involving Data getting his \"emotion chip\" implant; and John Alonzo's crystalline cinematography, which makes Generations the most beautiful Trek ever.", "The best thing about \"Star Trek Generations\" is [Patrick] Stewart, as Captain Picard, and the way the movie allows this powerfully charismatic Englishman to swagger the center and take command of one of America's most cherished fables.", "It's well-plotted, cleanly staged and, on the whole, not badly acted.", "Pretty much everything from the time Kirk leaves to the time he reappears is a distraction.", "A perfect microcosm on the film's problems can be found in Data's emotion chip snafu, a B-plot that runs the course of the whole film.", "The first big-screen adventure for the Star Trek: The Next Generation cast...", "\"Star Trek Generations\" never beams us down.
