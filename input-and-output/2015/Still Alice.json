{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Dr. Alice Howland (Julianne Moore) is a renowned linguistics professor at Columbia University. When words begin to escape her and she starts becoming lost on her daily jogs, Alice must come face-to-face with a devastating diagnosis: early-onset Alzheimer's disease. As the once-vibrant woman struggles to hang on to her sense of self for as long as possible, Alice's three grown children must watch helplessly as their mother disappears more and more with each passing day.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Richard Glatzer, Wash Westmoreland", "studio": "ShriverFilms,Lutzus-Brown,BigIndiePictures,KillerFilms", "theater_date": "Jan 16, 2015", "dvd_date": "Nov 8, 2016", "box_office": "$18.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A showcase for a beautiful portrayal of a woman who has everything stripped away from her.", "It is worthy of your time and emotional investment.", "The filmmakers' intentions may be entirely sincere, but one cannot avoid pointing out the safe and harmless character of the trend.", "It is a delicate and measured drama that arouses the curiosity of the demonstrated answers with what would be, if I am not mistaken, the best performance in Julianne Moore's career. [Full review in Spanish]", "That Moore's performance is fantastic should come as no surprise... Unfortunately, the rest of the film doesn't rise to the level of Moore's artistry.", "[Julianne Moore] is nothing short of perfect here, anchoring an extremely emotional subject - the shattering impact of dementia - with subtlety and grace.", "What would I do if tomorrow a terrifying diagnosis dropped out of nowhere? How would I navigate the waters of disappointment and broken expectations?", "It's a remarkable showcase for Moore, and if you've been keeping up with her roles, a testament to her prowess as an actor.", "Richard Glatzer and Wash Westmoreland's Still Alice succeeds in being intensely moving but mainly because of Moore.", "Intellectually, the sadness is undeniable, but Still Alice only rarely fulfils its potential for moving the viewer.", "Julianne Moore's performance as Dr. Alice Howland is, simply put, one of the best I've ever seen.", "A desire to avoid sentimentality is admirable, yet Still Alice relies entirely on Moore's performance to mask its multitude of shortcomings.", "This movie should be nothing more than a step-by-step, formulaic bore, and in many ways it is, but it's almost impossible not to be compelled by what Moore does on-screen.", "I thought [Richard] Glatzer's experience might give the film more insight than the usual able-bodied writer and director's view of disability. What I didn't expect from this film was how mild and polite it is about the challenges and loss Alice faces.", "A solid drama anchored by strong work from Moore in one of the best performances of her career.", "Still Alice takes an uncomfortable topic and wraps it in an easy-to-swallow format; a beautiful woman, pretty surroundings, and a happy-ish ending.", "It's in the Hamptons setting, the clich\u00e9d Super 8 family flashbacks and the demonstrative piano score that the film's pretensions to overly sermonise and molly-coddle is outed", "The movie matches its subject with a beautifully appropriate intelligence, and is smartly structured, switching perspectives from Alice's self-preservation to her family members' dealings so imperceptibly that a decisive moment never arrives.", "Still Alice is hard to watch especially is you've dealt with a similar real life situation; you know there is no good outcome. But as population grows, so does the number of sufferers. It's time a brave film like this shed light on a dark corner.", "That simple question is part of what gives Still Alice a particular resonance and makes its inexorable slide bearable; it's not a movie about a disease, but about a woman coming to terms with the hand she's been given."], "rating": ["4/5", "3.5/4", "", "7/10", "", "5/5", "", "3.5/5", "3/5", "3/5", "A", "3/5", "6.5/10", "", "B-", "3.5/5", "2/5", "B+", "3/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Richard Propes", "Joanne Laurier", "Yasser Medina", "Chris McCoy", "Nikki Baughan", "Debbie Holloway", "Nicholas Bell", "Alexa Dalby", "Rachel Brook", "Beth McDonough", "Patrick Gamble", "Bernard Boo", "Ren Jender", "Micheal Compton", "Di Golding", "PJ Nabarro", "Sky Hirschkron", "Anne Brodie", "Molly Templeton"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Roll Credits", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Narrative Muse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dog and Wolf", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Babbling Blonde", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Way Too Indie", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bitch Flicks", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dear Cast and Crew", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Stage", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">What She Said", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Eugene Weekly (OR)"], "date": ["February 2, 2021", "September 24, 2020", "August 11, 2020", "June 26, 2020", "January 9, 2020", "October 23, 2019", "October 21, 2019", "July 18, 2019", "May 31, 2019", "May 14, 2019", "May 10, 2019", "April 4, 2019", "March 20, 2019", "March 9, 2019", "January 24, 2019", "December 11, 2018", "November 10, 2018", "October 5, 2018", "August 30, 2018", "August 28, 2018"]}}
