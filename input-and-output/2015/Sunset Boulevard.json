The screenwriter believes he can manipulate her, but he soon finds out he is wrong.

Gloria Swanson and William Holden are superb in the leading roles.", "[Gloria Swanson] proves that in the years she has been off the screen she has lost none of her glamour, the magnetism that made her an outstanding personality of the early Hollywood days.", "The conception owes something to Miss Havisham in Great Expectations, but the film builds a myth of its own, one that taps into something essential about stardom.", "Sunset Boulevard (1950), the blackest of Hollywood's self-portraits, is an old dark house of a ghost story inhabited by the living shadows of its discarded stars.", "Rarely is fiction shot through so glitteringly with real life.", "[VIDEO ESSAY] Billy Wilder's deft weaving of gothic elements, not the least of which is Nora's decrepit mansion, casts a spell from which Joe is unable to break free. He, like the audience, is stuck in a terrible place awaiting an equally frightful fate.", "One of the great joys of the film is watching the way in which William Holden's naturalistic performance clashes with an actress and performance style from an earlier age.", "An uncompromising study of American decadence displaying a sad, worn, methodical beauty few films have had since the late twenties.", "Norma is something of a living legend, but she's also an unaware ghost: no longer of the world in which she thinks she lives.", "A must for fans of ruthless black comedy.", "Sunset Boulevard's entire point of view is based on a gimmick. Whether one considers it an \"artistic cheat\" or a valid and audacious device depends up his ability and desire to suspend his disbelief.", "Tears away at the curtain that keeps reality away from fiction.", "if you have the dream to make it to Tinsel Town, you might want to check this flick out because Hollywood is as hard on dreams as it was back in the 1950s"], "rating": ["3.5/4", "1", "", "", "5/5", "", "5/5", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "A+", "5/5", "", "", "5/5", "5.0/5", "", "2.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Nusair", "Mike Massie", "Joanne Laurier", "Petrana Radulovic", "Matt Neal", "Allen Almachar", "Danielle Solzman", "Clyde Gilmour", "Mildred Stockard", "Jake Wilson", "Sean Axmaker", "Marc Lee", "Cole Smithey", "Brian Holcomb", "Manny Farber", "Michael Nordine", "Scott G.
