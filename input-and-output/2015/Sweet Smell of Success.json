{"metadata": {"synopsis": "New York City newspaper writer J.J. Hunsecker (Burt Lancaster) holds considerable sway over public opinion with his Broadway column, but one thing that he can't control is his younger sister, Susan (Susan Harrison), who is in a relationship with aspiring jazz guitarist Steve Dallas (Marty Milner). Hunsecker strongly disproves of the romance and recruits publicist Sidney Falco (Tony Curtis) to find a way to split the couple, no matter how ruthless the method.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "Alexander Mackendrick", "studio": "NormaProductions,Hill-Hecht-LancasterProductions", "theater_date": "Jun 27, 1957", "dvd_date": "Apr 29, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The subject matter is incredibly mature, despite being shrouded by 1957-appropriate insinuation rather than graphic depiction.", "It's a tough tale about utterly amoral people.

The irony aside, its lightness and alliteration suggest the last breaths of one of the film's victims.", "... one of the most lacerating and vicious visions of the predatory urban world in the American cinema...", "Sweet Smell, which could have been offal, is raised to considerable dramatic heights by intense acting, taut direction (by Alexander Mackendrick), [and] superb camera work (by James Wong Howe).", "A masterpiece.", "The film is a masterpiece, intelligent Hollywood cinema at its best.", "Mackendrick's nighthawk landscape is compellingly, poetically bleak.", "Masterful direction and cinematography are shown off in this restored version, with Bernstein's apt jazzy score nailing all the right notes.", "James Hill's production, locationed in Manhattan, captures the feel of Broadway and environs after dark.", "Engaging, at times vicious drama w/Lancaster as acidic gossip monger, Curtis fine as wimpy sidekick.", "With some of the sharpest dialogue ever cut in Hollywood, only on the most superficial level is this a movie about gossip and publicity.
