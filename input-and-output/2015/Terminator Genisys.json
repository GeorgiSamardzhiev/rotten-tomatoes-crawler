Viewed in IMAX 3D, it may induce headaches.", "In an effort to make something new out of the pieces of the past, the movie relies on twists and time travel theatrics to push the plot instead of an actual coherent story.", "This film should be more on-point than ever, since technology has taken over our lives. But rather than actively antagonizing us, technology simply allows us easy ways to indulge in laziness and cruelty.", "Here, the new nemesis is as uninspired, unexplained, and unimpressive as imaginable.", "I hope he won't be back again.", "Terminator Genisys is essentially a hybrid between a reboot and a reimagining. It does take things back to the beginning, but for the right reasons.", "When you watch a Terminator film and Arnold Schwarzenegger is the least of the film's problems, you kinda know where I'm getting at.", "The fifth installment of the Terminator franchise is an uninspired drag ... There's a lack of creativity, ingenuity, and overall enjoyment here.", "Terminator Genisys isn't god-awful terrible, there simply isn't anything here to recommend.", "We have an Arnold Schwarzenegger totally dedicated to his best-known character, aware of the passage of time, and laughing at himself and his aptitudes as an actor. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Mediocrity and seemingly on-the-go decisions abound. [Full Review in Spanish]", "`Terminator Genisys` is a good summer entertainment and it has several exhilarating ideas that, to some extent, make up for its virtually inevitable gaps in the whole time travel mechanics. [Full Review in Spanish]", "It is not that the set pieces don't work, but the temporal jumps, typical of a frayed and tired superhero comic book, are not convincing either. [Full Review in Spanish]", "In place of Cameron's relentless action-inventiveness, we get derivative hackery and callbacks to action sequences that were better staged 25 years ago.", "[T]he story itself is well written with characters well crafted and yes, subtly nuanced. While the film is heavy on technology and action for set piece driven visuals, it is the character driven story elements that propel Genisys forward.", "Going to see this movie means absolute suspension of disbelief in every way. Don't analyze.", "Arnold is back, and it's great to see him prove once and for all that he may be old - but he's definitely not obsolete.", "It's damning that calling Genisys 'competent' or 'better than expected' somehow feels like praise, but there's a lot to enjoy here once you look past the franchise fatigue.", "There were so many missed opportunities in Terminator Genisys.", "Terminator: Genisys absolutely will not stop, even when it probably should."], "rating": ["", "3/5", "", "4/10", "1.5/4", "", "1/5", "D+", "C-", "", "", "", "", "", "", "C+", "3/4", "3/5", "D+", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Richard Crouse", "Sarah Marshall", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Damond Fudge", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Allen Almachar", "Brent McKnight", "Alberto Abu\u00edn", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Mikel Zorrilla", "Pablo Mu\u00f1oz", "Chris McCoy", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Leslie Combemale", "Matthew Lucas", "Tom Bond", "Rachel Wagner", "Richard Trenholm"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bitch Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KCCI (Des Moines, IA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Confessions From A Geek Mind", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNET"], "date": ["February 12, 2021", "February 3, 2021", "January 28, 2021", "December 4, 2020", "September 26, 2020", "July 17, 2020", "July 17, 2020", "July 15, 2020", "July 4, 2020", "May 8, 2020", "April 28, 2020", "April 28, 2020", "April 23, 2020", "January 10, 2020", "December 8, 2019", "October 16, 2019", "July 5, 2019", "May 7, 2019", "April 26, 2019", "April 16, 2019"]}}
