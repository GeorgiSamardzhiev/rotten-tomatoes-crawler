[Full Review in Spanish]", "Put simply, Salvation has bold concepts and an interesting tone but the characters just aren't all that compelling.", "[A]n explosive, exhilarating, entertaining summer blockbuster.", "A soulless, cynical film, designed only to mine a 25-year-old cash cow.", "As lifeless as its cyborg villains.", "While the sights and sounds of the Skynet military forces hunting down the rag-tag army are all that an adrenaline-junkie could wish for, the human element falls flat.", "I seriously thought my eardrums had burst a couple of times during Terminator Salvation. The movie sounds like jets crashing into a junkyard, one after another...", "It was good, but not great.", "Terminator Salvation is a loud exercise in post-apocalyptic mayhem.

The violence, the terror, the basic fear is gone ... In this film, children defeat a terminator.", "Once the screeching din has died down, you won't recall a single line of dialogue, note of music or plot point that wasn't punctuated with an explosion.", "This franchise, like its villains, has become more machine than man.", "That the film's overall basic point has already been conveyed by the closing lines of T2 some 18 years ago shows just how completely superfluous this cash grab is.", "Missing is Cameron's signature action modification, best exploited in Aliens: the strapping female heroine.
