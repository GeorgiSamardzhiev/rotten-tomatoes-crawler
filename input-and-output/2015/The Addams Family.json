{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Members of the mysterious and spooky Addams family -- Gomez, Morticia, Pugsley, Wednesday, Uncle Fester and Grandma -- are readily preparing for a visit from their even creepier relatives. But trouble soon arises when shady TV personality Margaux Needler realizes that the Addams' eerie hilltop mansion is standing in the way of her dream to sell all the houses in the neighborhood.", "rating": "44", "genre": "Animation/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 27m", "director": "Conrad Vernon, Greg Tiernan", "studio": "MetroGoldwynMayer,BermanBraun", "theater_date": "Oct 11, 2019", "dvd_date": "Oct 11, 2019", "box_office": "$673.0K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["We are left with a decent cutesy film that expands the Addams' universe, but does little to help it progress towards something greater or new.", "As was proven by the 1992-93 cartoon series, animation is the perfect medium for this creepy, kooky family, allowing more outlandish escapades", "The CG animation is nothing particularly remarkable but at least the movie does faithfully retain its macabre visuals and even getting the original characters design right.", "I think this franchise has finally reached its expiration date.", "This origin casts the Addams family as an immigrant story, and the film leans so hard into the theme of accepting those different from us and valuing diversity over conformity,", "One of those properties that works no matter the format whether a series movie or its latest iteration, a stop-motion animated movie, that's worthy of two snaps up.", "...The film's simplistic and episodic plot put a major dampener on what could have been a welcome breath of fresh air for family animation.", "While The Addams Family isn't super amazing, it's a good and fun film for this Halloween season.", "Despite the problems, I found The Addams Family to be refreshing.", "It has monsters doing/saying weird things and humans acting like huge jerks but when that's all you've got for 87 minutes, the novelty quickly wears thin.", "The animation is sharp, right down to Lurch's fingernails. The music is well-placed. The famous theme song pops up now and then but is not overdone.", "All the casting here, like the film itself, feels too marketing driven, and the latter is obviously an excuse for a bad hip-hop remix of the classic TV show theme song.", "This 2019 CGI remake misses the mark in the most crucial element of what has sustained The Addams Family all this time - its offbeat, macabre vibe. If you don't get that, you're really not going to get any of it.", "...it's sweet anyway, and like it or not, a sequel is a spookily sure thing.", "Now the mirthfully macabre clan known as the Addams Family - an iconic creation of legendary New Yorker cartoonist Charles Addams - have been fed into Hollywood's cartoon woodchipper.", "There's plenty of fun to be had with this snappy animated retread... there are enough confrontations and spook-based visual gags to make it an enjoyable, disposable jaunt with a timely and positive message about how best to shut down a bully.", "It's tedious but, worse, it's wasteful. The wealth of talent that has gone into its making has been frittered away in a vain attempt to pump new heart into a creation that ran out of puff long ago.", "Throw in a fantastic vocal cast... and the result is a terrific way to temporarily escape festive season madness.", "This version of The Addams Family is not nearly ooky or spooky enough.", "Can't help but feel like a wasted opportunity to truly embrace the source material's dark yet likeable temperament."], "rating": ["", "", "3/5", "", "", "8/10", "5.5/10", "7/10", "B", "C", "", "", "2.5/5", "6/10", "1.5/5", "3/5", "2/5", "3.5/5", "2.5/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Candice McMillan", "Damond Fudge", "Casey Chong", "Shawn Edwards", "Ryan Silberstein", "Jeffrey Lyles", "Jennifer Heaton", "Julian Lytle", "Damian Levy", "Matthew Toomey", "Stephen Romei", "Lina Lecaro", "Wenlei Ma", "David &#39;Mad Dog&#39; Bradley", "Leigh Paatsch", "Jim Schembri", "Sandra Hall", "James Croot", "Vicky Roach", "Peter Gray"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Refined", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KCCI (Des Moines, IA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Casey&#39;s Movie Mania", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fox 4 Kansas City", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema76", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lyles&#39; Movie Files", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternative Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">idobi.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Jamaica Gleaner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ABC Radio Brisbane", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Australian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">L.A.
