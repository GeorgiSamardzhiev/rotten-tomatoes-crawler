{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 2008, Wall Street guru Michael Burry realizes that a number of subprime home loans are in danger of defaulting. Burry bets against the housing market by throwing more than $1 billion of his investors' money into credit default swaps. His actions attract the attention of banker Jared Vennett (Ryan Gosling), hedge-fund specialist Mark Baum (Steve Carell) and other greedy opportunists. Together, these men make a fortune by taking full advantage of the impending economic collapse in America.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 10m", "director": "Adam McKay", "studio": "PlanBEntertainment", "theater_date": "Dec 23, 2015", "dvd_date": "Jul 7, 2016", "box_office": "$70.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Though presented as a jet black, indeed a cold-hearted, satire, it's concerned with reminding American audiences in particular just how close they came to economic Armageddon.", "Subtle it's not, but the director's use of pop culture images and music to set the scene goes a long way to establish a time, place and tone.", "It manages to illuminate how the economic failure occurred with scathing wit and highly-stylized editing that keeps you on your toes.", "The Big Short is both the defining film about the most recent financial crisis and the defining film of its director's young career so far.", "The Big Short is a remarkable piece of cinema and nothing seems to change.", "Even a talented cast cannot make this labyrinthine topic fully understandable unless the viewer is already modestly familiar with the subject matter.", "There isn't a sense of winning or losing - merely weathering the periods of time when the villainy of banks and the government are at their most extreme.", "The Big Short is as informative, insightful and innovative as it is drop dead entertaining.", "The Big Short keeps the narrative popping for a wealth of the run time.", "The standout, however, is Steve Carell's righteously angry Baum. Carell was primarily known as a comic actor, but he's been moving towards drama for a while now...", "McKay's masterful sendup of late-stage capitalism will leave you saying, \"Never again!\"", "Smart, funny, scary, ingeniously populated and a rollicking good time, The Big Short was such a left-field bolt from the blue and an enormously entertaining few hours in the cinema.", "Steve Carell, Christian Bale, Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt lead an ensemble cast firing on all cylinders.", "Teems with self-awareness about the complexity of Wall Street while using that opportunity to inject dark humor into what's otherwise a frighteningly bleak reality.", "You'll leave with both a firm understanding of tranche-bundled CODs and a strange fascination with Carell's wig.", "You painlessly learn a lot about financial markets and incidentally discover that understanding them can be fun.", "Many will find The Big Short a brilliant, intelligent, pointedly funny film", "The Big Short could have been a subtle, restrained procedural drama. Instead, it's a confused clusterfuck of cinematic tropes piled atop a good yarn.", "[It] is an oftentimes perplexing yet scathing indictment of the banking and financial industry; made entertaining thanks to its stellar cast.", "The direction is fantastic and dynamic and the story truly entertains while it informs.
