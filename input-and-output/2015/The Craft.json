{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After transferring to a Los Angeles high school, Sarah (Robin Tunney) finds that her telekinetic gift appeals to a group of three wannabe witches, who happen to be seeking a fourth member for their rituals. Bonnie (Neve Campbell), Rochelle (Rachel True) and Nancy (Fairuza Balk), like Sarah herself, all have troubled backgrounds, which combined with their nascent powers lead to dangerous consequences. When a minor spell causes a fellow student to lose her hair, the girls grow power-mad.", "rating": "55", "genre": "Drama/Horror", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Andrew Fleming", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 12, 2014", "box_office": "$22.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Masquerades as a female empowerment film despite prioritizing the toxicity that can be rampant in groups of friends (female or otherwise).", "I really enjoy the characters. Every single one of them is very unique and the film does an excellent job at fleshing out each girl.", "I've never subscribed to this genre of movie...I found a lot of this stuff to just not be palatable. But for its time, it's an okay movie.", "The effects are obviously a bit rough around the edges, and the acting is very mixed.", "Despite the fact that none of the actresses were anywhere near teen age while making the film, they're all pretty convincing as tortured teens expressing their pubescent angst through magic.", "I really like Fairuza Balk as an actress and I really enjoyed her here.", "The early going is interesting, amusing and even clever, but such cinematic niceties give way to a disappointing second hour.", "We watched Rochelle take her own power and take her own revenge. It is one of the many reasons why The Craft was ahead of its time.", "At an over-long 100 minutes, it's not likely to cast a spell over anyone.", "[It] will perhaps inspire a few rebel kids to search out a black-magic emporium or to make the sort of fashion statements that make Balk so amusingly spooky. All others should balk at taking in this suspenseless, hollow, kitchily crafted Carrie.", "What can you say about a movie that seems to have been conceived like a trailer and written in exclamation points and gets stolen by the cinematographer?", "It's rare enough in these days of studio megahype to be pleasantly surprised by a relatively unheralded movie, but such is the case with the second film from the director Andrew Davies", "... deliciously dangerous excursions into adolescent self-discovery.", "The Craft casts a relatively potent spell.", "The glossy style and neat visual effects combine with a few genuinely creepy moments to make this above-average genre fare, though the full-on sorcery showdown belongs in another movie.", "Still, with suitable suspension of disbelief this makes for agreeable enough nonsense.", "The best teen flick since Clueless is The Craft.", "The great strength of The Craft is that it doesn't pass judgment on why the girls are doing what they do... The film's message of female empowerment felt cathartic, but so did its rage.", "Will appeal to fantasy and horror buffs alike.", "There are some funny lines in there.
