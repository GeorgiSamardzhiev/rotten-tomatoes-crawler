In-other-words The Danish Girl is a fiction based film taken from the skeletal remains of whatever scraps of paper were left behind after the Great War.", "A work of tremulous beauty buoyed by two of the most powerful screen performances in recent memory.", "Hooper's direction is refreshingly frank about how confusing and overwhelming Lili's transition was for her and her wife. Elsewhere, Coxon's immaculate script is perceptive, if a little on-the-nose...", "The film is masterfully composed and boasts two strong central performances that will undoubtedly merit their certain Academy recognition.", "Not always engaging, The Danish Girl is still able to provide some heartfelt moments even while the overall story arc could have been expanded upon.", "The whole film feels very dated but also, in spite of it being \"based on a true story\", false.", "The most gorgeous pictures in the world can't cover up phoniness, and that's exactly what Hooper and Redmayne's Lili feels like: phony. A pretty portrait of the wrong woman.", "The Danish Girl is certainly well-directed and certainly boasts great performances, but the story sells audiences short. [Full Review in Spanish]", "While Redmayne bravely steps into a unique role, it is Gerda's perpective and Vikander's acting that stand out.", "While the film has flaws that hinder it from being fully gripping (the last act in particular), Hooper has made a dazzling picture that is just another notch on his shiny awards season belt.", "Looks as flat as a board. It has zero interest in composition, or any elements that might suggest film is a visual language... However, the film's self-serving faux-progressiveness is a worse offense.", "The film's extraordinary, detailed visual beauty will stay with you long after the movie is over.", "Every second in Hooper's film is arranged like a Vanity Fair shoot... Indeed, so overwrought are some moments that you may struggle to keep a straight face amid all the hamming and political worthiness.", "Alicia Vikander is a joy to watch but the film doesn't captivate and the ending is just so ridiculous I instantly forgot it until I looked back at my notes.", "Considering Elbe's legacy and her importance to trans history, there's something a little strange and uncomfortable about watching The Danish Girl."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "", "5.5/10", "", "", "B+", "", "", "3/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Leela Ginelle", "Avaryl Halley", "Andrew Galdi", "Dan Scully", "Chris McCoy", "Alexander Ryll", "Matthew Lucas", "Tom Bond", "Tom Duggins", "Mae Abdulbaki", "Ren Jender", "Bernard Boo", "David Ocadiz", "Nathalia Aryani", "James Clay", "Glenn Heath Jr.", "Marcianne Miller", "Hilary A White", "Rosalynn Try-Hane", "Madeleine Davies"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bitch Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema76", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gay Essential", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies with Mae", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bitch Flicks", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Way Too Indie", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinerg\u00e9tica", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Diego Entertainer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fresh Fiction", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Diego CityBeat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bold Life (Hendersonville, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">State.ie", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Battle Royale With Cheese", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Muse/Jezebel"], "date": ["February 9, 2021", "April 30, 2020", "April 30, 2020", "April 7, 2020", "January 13, 2020", "September 15, 2019", "July 5, 2019", "April 17, 2019", "April 8, 2019", "April 5, 2019", "March 7, 2019", "February 22, 2019", "February 13, 2019", "January 24, 2019", "December 14, 2018", "November 3, 2018", "August 26, 2018", "August 21, 2018", "August 21, 2018", "June 13, 2018"]}}
