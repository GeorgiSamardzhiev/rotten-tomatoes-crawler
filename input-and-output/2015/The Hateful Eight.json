{"metadata": {"synopsis": "While racing toward the town of Red Rock in post-Civil War Wyoming, bounty hunter John \"The Hangman\" Ruth (Kurt Russell) and his fugitive prisoner (Jennifer Jason Leigh) encounter another bounty hunter (Samuel L. Jackson) and a man who claims to be a sheriff. Hoping to find shelter from a blizzard, the group travels to a stagecoach stopover located on a mountain pass. Greeted there by four strangers, the eight travelers soon learn that they may not make it to their destination after all.", "rating": "74", "genre": "Western", "runtime": "2h 48m", "director": "Quentin Tarantino", "studio": "ABandApart", "theater_date": "Dec 30, 2015", "dvd_date": "Mar 2, 2017", "box_office": "$54.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's big and daring but also, I'm afraid, bloated, with a pay off not large enough to justify the more than three-hour running time.", "Whatever their motivation, the results justify it all the way, allowing the super-wide, 2.75:1 frame to capture many characters within the same frame, playing the background against the foreground...", "The mystery has few surprises, particularly as the tension is mitigated by prolonged conversations in a stagecoach, a stable, a way station, and around a dinner table.", "I wouldn't mind being exhausted watching The Hateful Eight if it actually added up to something or said something or even just managed to entertain me.", "For a simple premise and multi-layered characters, Tarantino's expert style and execution makes his eighth film an enjoyable experience.", "The Hateful Eight is a hilarious, suspenseful, bloody and masterful epic. It might also just be the year's best film.", "Only in Quentin Tarantino's mind is the idea of filming a western as violent, as entertaining and as original as The Hateful Eight. [Full review in Spanish]", "Tarantino has created a highly immersive world populated by fully fleshed-out characters, but he's also made a movie that's incredibly cruel. The third act, in particular, is chock full of cruelty...", "There are a hundred reasons why a three-hour widescreen epic that devolves into an Agatha Christie play shouldn't work, and yet... The Hateful Eight comes off as more satisfying than Inglourious Basterds or Django Unchained.", "The Hateful Eight still stands head and shoulders above most other fare on offer in cinemas right now, and it's a worthy addition to the Tarantino library.", "It takes something special like a Tarantino film to relive that trembling magic of the cinema.", "The Hateful Eight is ambitious, complex yet wildly entertaining. For a 187-minute film, it's worth it.", "The Hateful Eight contains the traditional Tarantino values of racism, violence, and controversy but sets itself apart with brilliant cinematography and classic, mysterious story-telling.", "Now, 'This' is how you make a movie!", "The Hateful Eight is not just a movie. This is an experience. And that's exactly what Director/Writer Quentin Tarantino was aiming for.", "The Hateful Eight is a unique cinematic experience that transcends most of the best films of 2015. Instead of solely being a good film, it goes beyond that, resting its roots in the past and its ambition in the future.", "The unexpected whodunit aspect of this deeply untrustworthy tale took on a life of its own, and the delectable dialogue so memorably delivered just delighted me at every turn.", "Razor-sharp, witty, suspenseful and violent, it marks the signature Tarantino blend of style and substance.", "The Hateful Eight is worthless, mean-spirited, racial and sexist fetishism doused in schlocky fake blood, and an artist as skilled as Tarantino should know it.", "A claustrophobic, theatrical experiment of Hitchcockian proportions - as thrilling as it is frustrating."], "rating": ["3.5/5", "", "3/10", "1.5/4", "4/5", "", "9/10", "", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "8/10", "", "", "", "4.5/5", "5/5", "F-", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Scott Nye", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Damond Fudge", "Yasser Medina", "Tim Brennan", "Chris McCoy", "Grethe Kemp", "David Harris", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Brandon Davis", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Linda and Al Lerner", "Jay Slayton-Joslin", "Kate Rodger", "Ben Rolph", "Ryan Syrek", "Christopher Preston"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Battleship Pretension", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Confessions From A Geek Mind", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KCCI (Des Moines, IA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">About Boulder", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">City Press (South Africa)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flick Feast", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ComicBook.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies and Shakers", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cultured Vultures", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newshub (NZ)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Discussing Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Reader (Omaha, NE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View"], "date": ["February 3, 2021", "January 7, 2021", "December 4, 2020", "September 10, 2020", "July 17, 2020", "June 30, 2020", "June 26, 2020", "February 13, 2020", "January 13, 2020", "January 8, 2020", "December 3, 2019", "November 18, 2019", "November 13, 2019", "November 5, 2019", "October 24, 2019", "October 9, 2019", "August 23, 2019", "August 5, 2019", "July 9, 2019", "April 9, 2019"]}}
