The Intouchables brings a new, refreshing level to the genre - it only took a real-life, improbable friendship to inspire the making of the film.", "Don't miss this exhilarating film...", "There are much better contemporary movies about dealing with the dynamics of being handicapped or wheelchair bound and overcoming obstacles, such as Rust & Bone, Amour, and The Diving bell and the Butterfly.", "Without getting into spoilers, can I just say how refreshing it was to watch a film about a physically challenged person that didn't end on a total downer?", "Gives its subject too light a treatment for the life-affirming message to feel earned.", "This pleasant, predictable, fact-based tale of an unlikely friendship between a quadriplegic and his carer hits all the sweet spots a feel-good movie must.", "In the wrong hands this film could have been a sentimental mess. Luckily it's not and instead of being a film about labels, it's about people and the healing power of camaraderie.", "I think a lot of people are going to enjoy it but I think it also tries too hard to please that audience and it just shrieks, aiming at that middle bar.", "The problem is that if, while you're having a good time with these characters, you start to think about the wider implications of the film, you might find yourself somewhat less enthralled.", "Is The Intouchables an enjoyable movie if you overlook a few potentially queasy-making scenes? Absolutely. Is it great filmmaking in the neighbourhood of art? Nope.", "Oscar-nominated, lauded at festivals overseas and now, one of the most successful French pictures of all time, The Intouchables is simply irresistible.", "The two heartfelt central performances from Franois Cluzet and Omar Sy will inject you with happiness", "Capturing the unspoken shorthand, the adventurousness and the humour essential to enduring friendships makes the The Intouchables must see.", "Buddy movies don't come more moving, funnier and more successful than The Intouchables, based on a true story"], "rating": ["9/10", "", "A", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "8/10", "", "3/5", "5/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "9/10", "A-", "4.5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Dan Buffa", "Allen Almachar", "Jim Ross", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Amon Warmann", "Sarah Gopaul", "Neely Swanson", "Staci Layne Wilson", "James Plath", "Michael Nordine", "Jim Schembri", "Cameron Williams", "Margaret Pomeranz", "David Stratton", "Lisa Nesselson", "Ed Gibbs", "Matthew Toomey", "Blake Howard", "Andrew L.
