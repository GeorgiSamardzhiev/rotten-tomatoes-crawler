Kevin Kline is meant to play Hollywood legend Errol Flynn. It's just too bad that \"The Last of Robin Hood\" didn't cover more ground.", "The careful handling of the story has the unintended effect of sucking the life ( and practically all the juice ) out of what could have been a more-than-delicious piece of cinema trash.", "...an exculpatory fairy tale", "Movies shouldn't always judge their protagonists, but a little judging might have helped The Last of Robin Hood.", "[It] looks lowly and limp, and we seldom feel just how much is at stake.", "Clearly, the subject matter makes for a sordid Hollywood tale that's still relevant today. Why, then, is this story related with all the lackadaisical tempo of a Mutual of Omaha commercial?", "Belongs to a newly active subgenre that we might dub the celebrity bio-episode, to distinguish it from the more conventional biopic...", "Pointless and creepy.", "The film becomes a showcase for Kline and Sarandon - and a reminder of how great actors can light up the screen, staying with you even as the rest of the film slips away.", "The Last of Robin Hood is relatively harmless. That is also its major flaw, considering the harmful subject matter.", "As art, it's considerably shallow, weighted down by thin writing and wan direction. But the film nevertheless holds you in its grip, as it cuts to the heart of how low people will stoop to gain - or maintain - the perks of celebrity.", "A character study of an ultimately pathetic man.", "A strong trio of leads can't overcome a lackluster script.", "This is a film that is truly about a sketchy, taboo subject, but it's surprisingly lukewarm, tepid even, taking few risks other than trying to simply lay out events that happened.", "Scandalous May-December romance has sex, language.", "It's a magnificent performance by Kline inside a flat, lifeless movie."], "rating": ["", "2.5/5", "4/10", "3", "C", "", "8", "2.5/4", "", "1.5/4", "2.5/4", "1/4", "2.5/4", "1.5/5", "B-", "3/5", "2.5/4", "1.5/5", "2/5", "2/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Chris McCoy", "Nicholas Bell", "Debbie Baldwin", "Bill Newcott", "Paul Chambers", "Richard Knight", "Philip Martin", "Christian Toto", "Anthony Lane", "Matt Brunson", "John Beifuss", "Matt Pais", "Moira MacDonald", "Bill Gibron", "Al Alexander", "Richard Roeper", "Scott Nash", "Anders Wright", "S.
