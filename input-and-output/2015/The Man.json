{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Seeking the gunrunners who killed his partner, undercover cop Derrick Vann (Samuel L. Jackson) sets up a sting. He arranges to meet an arms dealer at a diner, where he'll be the only one reading USA Today. But dentist Andy Fiddler (Eugene Levy), who's in Detroit for a conference, is there reading the same paper, and the dealer mistakes him for Vann and sets up the deal. When Vann realizes this, he drags the baffled Andy into the operation, forcing him to pose as the fake buyer.", "rating": "12", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 23m", "director": "Les Mayfield", "studio": "FriedFilms", "theater_date": "Sep 9, 2005", "dvd_date": "Apr 23, 2013", "box_office": "$8.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The pairing had potential to be quite funny, but unfortunately they are stuck with a script that feels like its been on the shelf since the mid-'80's.", "While Fiddler is a bumbler, he is not stupid, and actually makes a few good decisions.

They are an interesting pair, and in this genre, that is what really counts.", "A derivative, readily-forgettable insult to the intelligence!", "...watered-down and egregiously silly...", "", "", "If the fart jokes had been cut out, if the ultimate identity were less of an anticlimax, if Levy had had some context, if Jackson showed the slightest rapport with his co-star... No, it's no good; The Man is a dud.
