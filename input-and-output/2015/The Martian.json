{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When astronauts blast off from the planet Mars, they leave behind Mark Watney (Matt Damon), presumed dead after a fierce storm. With only a meager amount of supplies, the stranded visitor must utilize his wits and spirit to find a way to survive on the hostile planet.

It's fun, exciting, and a thrilling spectacle with deep emotional payoffs and strong performances from its all-star cast.", "Matt Damon's strong central performance anchors this compelling sci-fi adventure about a man stuck on Mars while the folks back home try to find an easy way to rescue him.", "When the bits of suspense arrive, they're handled with Scott's veteran expertise and Damon's sensational screen presence.", "[Damon] is supported by a top-flight cast that includes Jessica Chastain, Donald Glover, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Benedict Wong, Aksel Hennie...", "The screenplay, unhappily, has retained the general flatness of the scenes on Earth...Scott has a number of talented performers at his disposal, who struggle to make something of the oddly colorless and often drama-less dialogue...", "An epic space adventure, a story of one man's determination, fighting for survival in the most hostile environment imaginable, an effects-driven tentpole, a small human story, and much more.", "It has to be said directly: The Martian is a very clever movie and perhaps the most intriguing science fiction movie that Ridley Scott has directed in a long time.

It is also a first class piece of cinematic entertainment...", "The Martian is the movie we need right now.", "The Martian is a major return to form for Scott, who seems inspired by NASA's can-do spirit.", "Watney may be taking a bunch of giant steps for mankind, but The Martian merely tiptoes around other great films that take on a similar topic.", "The Martian consumes audiences from start to finish. Damon's witty performance makes the film both fun and intense while Scott's balance of Mars, Earth, emotion, politics, science and humor is an impressive and enthralling feat.", "\"The Martian\" is this decade's \"Cast Away,\" but if \"Cast Away\" took place in a world that was constantly plugged in and online.", "The Martian is that rare film that both thrills and inspires, so much so that i'm sure it will be seen repeatedly at the theater and at home for years to come."], "rating": ["8/10", "", "4/4", "6/10", "", "", "A", "7/10", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "8.4/10", "A-", "A"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicole Ackman", "Rudie Obias", "Wesley Lovell", "Mike Massie", "Norman Wilner", "David Walsh", "Brent McKnight", "Yasser Medina", "Andrew Galdi", "Avaryl Halley", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Alberto Abu\u00edn", "Dan Scully", "Kathi Maio", "Tim Brennan", "Chris McCoy", "David Harris", "Brandon Davis", "Kirsten Acuna", "Leslie Combemale"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Next Best Picture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Battleship Pretension", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Sight", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">NOW Toronto", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema76", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">About Boulder", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ComicBook.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Business Insider", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren"], "date": ["January 30, 2021", "January 15, 2021", "December 16, 2020", "December 4, 2020", "November 10, 2020", "August 20, 2020", "July 3, 2020", "June 26, 2020", "April 29, 2020", "April 29, 2020", "April 10, 2020", "April 10, 2020", "April 7, 2020", "March 11, 2020", "February 13, 2020", "January 10, 2020", "December 2, 2019", "November 13, 2019", "October 27, 2019", "October 16, 2019"]}}
