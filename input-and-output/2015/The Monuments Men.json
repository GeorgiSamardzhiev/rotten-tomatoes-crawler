{"metadata": {"synopsis": "During World War II, the Nazis steal countless pieces of art and hide them away. Some over-the-hill art scholars, historians, architects and other experts form a unit to retrieve as many of the stolen masterpieces as possible. The mission becomes even more urgent when the team learns about Hitler's \"Nero Decree,\" which orders destruction of the artworks if the Third Reich falls. Caught in a race against time, the men risk their lives to protect some of mankind's greatest achievements.", "rating": "30", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "1h 58m", "director": "George Clooney", "studio": "SmokeHouse", "theater_date": "Feb 7, 2014", "dvd_date": "Sep 7, 2014", "box_office": "$78.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An earnestly told story but the lack of any real energy or surprises undermines its effectiveness.", "To adequately fill a two-hour movie, greater creative liberties should have been employed to offer a tighter pace, heightened adventure, and more moving poignancy.", "It's definitely not a coincidence that the film was pulled from its pre-Oscar consideration calendar date and placed squarely into the land of forgotten films.", "Sadly, on reflection, one cannot think of a single moment in The Monuments Men that is genuinely challenging to conventional wisdom, or even surprising.", "The tone was very confused.", "It was just really kind of flat.", "It may not dig very deep, but it's an effortlessly entertaining homage to the Golden Age of Hollywood that packs a surprising emotional wallop.", "Undeveloped characters and no clear narrative waste a fascinating story and profound theme. This is a monumental mess.", "The Monuments Men is a buddy movie, an adventure film, and a throwback to less cynical times.", "The Monuments Men feels like a monumentally wasted opportunity.", "It's certainly enjoyable seeing this great group of actors...get to work with each other, given time to build moments and reactions, albeit the film's insistent score sometimes overwhelms the action.", "Clooney is trying to push the merit of the material a touch too much; a fact betrayed by the amount of times his character ventriloquises the film's two main morals.", "The rare misfire from a helmer who usually evinces just as much self-assuredness behind the camera as he so easily embodies in front of it.", "The movie is fine, but it should have been a powerful, moving and heroic film. It could have been a classic, instead it was a romp.", "Clooney speeches and preaches nonstop throughout.", "A monumental failure.", "An engaging throwback to films of yesteryear with entertaining performances and a story that finally offers us a new spin on a tired genre.", "What may surprise viewers most about the film is its unabashedly patriotic tone.", "George Clooney's simplistic wartime art heist movie staggers between parody and sincerity, failing at both.", "Murray and Goodman seem to light up the screen whenever they appear, and scenes such as one that takes place at Christmastime during the Battle of the Bulge are especially moving."], "rating": ["2/5", "6/10", "2.5/4", "", "", "", "3/4", "2/5", "7/10", "", "B", "3/5", "C", "6/10", "1/5", "2/5", "7/10", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Joanne Laurier", "Andrew Galdi", "Avaryl Halley", "Matthew Lucas", "Chris Davies", "Julie Crawford", "Nathalia Aryani", "Abbie Bernstein", "PJ Nabarro", "Zaki Hasan", "Debbie Baldwin", "Daniel Barnes", "Alistair Ryder", "Aaron Peterson", "Megan Basham", "Kate Muir", "Josh Terry"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">North Shore News (Vancouver, B.C.)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Diego Entertainer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Assignment X", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Zaki&#39;s Corner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Ladue News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dare Daniel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemole", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Hollywood Outsider", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WORLD", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Deseret News (Salt Lake City)"], "date": ["February 1, 2021", "December 4, 2020", "September 17, 2020", "August 13, 2020", "April 27, 2020", "April 27, 2020", "July 4, 2019", "June 8, 2019", "April 17, 2019", "January 25, 2019", "January 17, 2019", "December 16, 2018", "November 27, 2018", "November 14, 2018", "November 13, 2018", "October 21, 2018", "October 12, 2018", "April 11, 2018", "January 2, 2018", "November 28, 2017"]}}
