This is the childish fantasy of what that's supposed to look like.", "Stiller delivers an enjoyable take on the modern man's existential crisis, aided greatly by stunning cinematography.", "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty's most disappointing aspect is that Stiller has taken genuinely timeless themes and diluted them in a sea of schmaltz and sentimentality.", "It fails to understand that poignancy isn't something you set out to try and be, and that trying to just makes you look pretentious.", "The story is a combination of romance, action, mystery and comedy. It never misses a beat and skilfully delivers a feel good film that doesn't appear to blatantly manipulate audiences.", "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty ticks all the boxes for a sweet-natured family film and is spectacular on many levels.", "There are great moments throughout, but I couldn't help feeling this was largely a wild fantasy on the part of Stiller, who is not a talented straight actor, and who has effortfully stretched the original story beyond all recognition.", "Although Stiller has acted in far-out films like Zoolander before, this one gives viewers another side to this actor - one who can handle such ambitious films with ease.", "There's a nice, chill, un-cynical sweetness to Mitty, that, after a bunch of heavy prestige pics, was welcome.", "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty can sometimes feel like listening to a high-school slam poet read from his latest diary entry: it's all-too earnest and over-the-top heartfelt. You can't help but smile and look away.", "Along with turning in a nuanced performance, Stiller proves he has developed a keen ear and eye as a filmmaker.", "This is surprisingly nowhere near the Hollywood nightmare you might be thinking (or fearing).", "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty is a good-hearted delight.", "The most universally satisfying Hollywood films are usually predicated on a dialectical relationship... But Walter Mitty is too clumsy and afraid to offend to properly take that journey, not unlike its titular character.", "With such high aims, it's too bad that 'The Secret Life of Walter Mitty' falls somewhat short of greatness. But it's not often that you come across a \"big\" movie as earnest and patently un-cynical as this one."], "rating": ["4/5", "3/10", "3.0/4", "3.5/5", "4/5", "2/5", "4/5", "2/5", "5/10", "", "", "2/5", "4/5", "", "", "4/4", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Mark Jackson", "Don Shanahan", "Nicholas Bell", "David Brake", "Patrick Gamble", "Jennifer Heaton", "Sarah Gopaul", "Chloe Leeson", "Camilla Long", "Reagan Gavin Rasquinha", "Sarah Marrs", "Heather Dockray", "Brandy McDonnell", "David &#39;Mad Dog&#39; Bradley", "Tara Thorne", "Violet Lucca", "Jason Bailey"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Epoch Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">25YL (25 Years Later)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternative Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Digital Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen Queens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sunday Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Times of India", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinesnark", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Uproxx", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Oklahoman", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Adelaide Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Coast (Halifax, Nova Scotia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reverse Shot", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flavorwire"], "date": ["February 1, 2021", "December 4, 2020", "September 22, 2020", "April 2, 2020", "November 18, 2019", "August 29, 2019", "June 8, 2019", "March 7, 2019", "November 1, 2018", "November 1, 2018", "August 24, 2018", "February 22, 2018", "November 18, 2017", "October 20, 2017", "August 24, 2017", "October 25, 2016", "August 10, 2016", "July 11, 2016", "June 20, 2016", "June 19, 2016"]}}
