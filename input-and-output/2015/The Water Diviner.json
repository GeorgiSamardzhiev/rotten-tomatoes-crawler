{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Four years after the Battle of Gallipoli, Australian farmer Joshua Connor (Russell Crowe) travels to Turkey to find his three sons, who never returned home from the war. When he arrives in Istanbul, he meets others who have also suffered losses: hotelier Ayshe (Olga Kurylenko) and her son, Orhan, who befriends Connor; and Major Hasan (Yilmaz Erdogan), a Turkish officer who fought against Connor's sons and now may be their father's only hope in finding closure.", "rating": "62", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 52m", "director": "Russell Crowe", "studio": "HopscotchFeatures,FearofGodFilms", "theater_date": "Apr 24, 2015", "dvd_date": "Jul 7, 2015", "box_office": "$34.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A sweeping historical drama about one man; a personal story set against a huge backdrop that studies a father's sorrow and a nation's tribulations.", "While Crowe the actor has impressive screen presence and conveys grief with subtlety, Crowe the director errs on the side of caution in this conservatively directed feature, which splutters along...", "Successfully navigating war, drama, action and romance, this film has it all on both sides of the camera.", "The film's got issues, but it's a sincere, mournful celebration of a country that turned the pain of loss into strength.", "Trying to do too much, and losing the humanity in his story, The Water Diviner is just a mess.", "As a debut it is a remarkable effort, with Crowe showing a great deal of sophistication in handling the narrative.", "\"The Water Diviner\" is a beautiful story engaging the viewer on many different levels.", "Once again the character representative of Christianity shows only selfish, shallow callousness while the character representative of Islam offers a well-spring of peace, rest, and reoriented perspective for the weary Western protagonist's soul.", "Thinking that a movie directed by Russell Crowe is good may be the film reviewer's equivalent of crying: \"Look at the dog! It walks!\" But everything fits together, and it's well shot and satisfyingly pacy.", "There are some good scenes in Crowe's directorial debut, but it mostly feels like a fumbled opportunity to make a much more significant film.", "There's no such elegance in The Water Diviner. Crowe's performance is great but he's basically a bull in a china shop, rampaging gracelessly through the emotionally reductive landscape of his film.", "The film is filled with exotic locales, brilliant supporting actors and lots of drama and emotion. Well done, Crowe.", "It's the cinematic equivalent of switching between 40 open tabs on your computer for two hours.", "There are fine things everywhere you look in this Australian historical drama. Yet, when it's over, you're still thirsty for a better movie.", "This is a movie lacking in life or vibrancy, or any real emotions for us to actually connect to or relate to the characters; it is enamoured by its subject matter and as such tries to make itself too respectful.", "The preposterousness of [the story] is offset by Crowe's powerful depiction of the horrors of war for both the Australians and Turks.", "[This is] for the tiresome cynics who think that many films aren't about anything anymore, and would rather a film be definitively about something, than any good overall.", "Crowe perfectly plays a dad going in search of the three sons believed to have been killed in action at Gallipoli in the First World War.", "As expected, what an actor-turned-director like Crowe can do is pull strong performances out of his cast.", "A well-meaning, worthy and, at times, moving ode to Gallipoli."], "rating": ["3/5", "", "5/5", "6.5/10", "4/10", "3/5", "3.5/4", "", "3/5", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "3/5", "C-", "4/5", "3.5/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Udita Jhunjhunwala", "Bertie Archer", "Bernard Boo", "Deirdre Crimmins", "Joseph Walsh", "Pamela Powell", "Megan Basham", "Camilla Long", "Uri Klein", "Sarah Marrs", "Jason Francis Johnson", "Megan Burbank", "Eleanor Ringel Cater", "Alistair Ryder", "Edmund Lee", "Nick Allen", "Alex Zane", "Cris Kennedy", "Nick Dent"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Livemint", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Way Too Indie", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinematic Essential", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Journal (Kankakee, IL)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WORLD", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sunday Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Haaretz", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lainey Gossip", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New Paper (Singapore)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Stranger (Seattle, WA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Saporta Report (Atlanta)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Inquiry", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South China Morning Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Stage", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Sun (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Canberra Times (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (Australia)"], "date": ["February 3, 2021", "August 14, 2019", "May 14, 2019", "March 14, 2019", "August 30, 2018", "August 22, 2018", "August 21, 2018", "March 16, 2018", "February 15, 2018", "January 12, 2018", "October 16, 2017", "September 20, 2017", "August 22, 2017", "June 27, 2017", "May 11, 2017", "April 2, 2016", "February 24, 2016", "December 30, 2015", "December 30, 2015", "December 21, 2015"]}}
