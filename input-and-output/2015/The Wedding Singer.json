{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Set in 1985, Adam Sandler plays a nice guy with a broken heart who's stuck in one of the most romantic jobs in the world, a wedding singer. He loses all hope when he is abandoned at the altar by his fianc\u00e9. He meets a young woman named Julia (Drew Barrymore), who enlists his help to plan her wedding. He falls in love with her and must win her over before she gets married.", "rating": "69", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "Frank Coraci", "studio": "NewLineCinema,JunoPix", "theater_date": "Feb 13, 1998", "dvd_date": "Sep 1, 2008", "box_office": "$80.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["So funny and charming, with some excellent cameos.", "There's some cheap nostalgia at play here (okay, maybe a lot) but it's more than made up for with genuine laughs and a ton of heart.", "Puppy charm, retro-hip and some good old-fashioned romantic chemistry lift a traditional comedy to the brighter realms of a pleasant, quirky and genuinely touching slice of matinee entertainment.", "The chemistry between Sandler and Barrymore is something special to see here, and I think 'The Wedding Singer' ends up being Sandler's best movie.", "Not the most original comedy, but many will enjoy.", "The tone set by director Frank Coraci tends to the cartoonishly broad while making jokes at the expense of grotesques. [Blu-ray]", "Although the movie is remarkably schmaltzy, it's sweet and affecting, too, with Sandler's character as genuinely nice as he can be.", "Called on to replace some of his Happy Gilmore shtick with the emoting of a romantic lead, he does just that but in an unpersuasive on/off fashion.", "Supporting players are uniformly strong, and Coraci deserves much credit for exacting just the right degree of outrageousness without spinning into some wild orbit.", "Yes, it's sappy. It's also silly, utterly unironic, a sketch stretched out to feature length, and, if you're in the right mood, pretty darned cute.", "Barrymore and Sandler are lovely together, and the movie, set in 1985, was also among the first to tap into 1980s nostalgia.", "The plotting is simplistic but cute and the gags are consistently funny, particularly for anyone who grew up in the 1980s.", "You can't help pulling for the kids.", "It's charmingly bad and an excellent date film.", "Uneven and silly? Yes. Enjoyable? Most definitely.", "", "An hour and a half of solid entertainment.", "Fairly typical comedy, in that moments of genuine humor are spread out too thinly over a schmaltzy (sorry, \"heartwarming\") script. But how can you give a failing grade to a movie that spotlights silly early Eighties music?", "Besides music that harks back to the days when MTV was worth watching (Martha Quinn Forever!), The Wedding Singer is also a sweet, beguiling romantic comedy.", ""], "rating": ["", "A-", "4/5", "", "3/5", "2/4", "6/10", "", "", "3/4", "3/4", "4/4", "", "2/5", "B", "3/5", "5/10", "D+", "3/4", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Charlotte Harrison", "Brian Gill", "Yael Shuv", "Betty Jo Tucker", "Charles Cassady", "Peter Canavese", "John J.
