[Full review in Spanish]", "Ozu's film is a beautiful piece of art and cinema.", "A nuanced tale of family ties and growing apart.", "Ozu counters the interiority of the drama with just enough hints of the outside world to reflect the irreparable passing of time which is so crucial to the film's sentiment.", "If everyone in the world took the time to watch Tokyo Story, there would be no more wars, negativity or Twitter. There would only be love, life and lots of sake.", "After seeing so many busy, ostentatious films with histrionic, even hysterical, direction, it is a relief to see one that is quiet and composed and tells its story in the most unobtrusive manner possible.", "It's not until the heartbreaking denouement you realise how immersive Tokyo Story is, and how it snuck up on you and worked its way into your heart.", "It's entirely possible that Tokyo Story isn't the best movie ever made. But I suspect that it might be the most perfect.", "[VIDEO ESSAY] Yasujir\u00f4 Ozu's beloved masterpiece of postwar Japanese cinema speaks to audiences from all backgrounds because of the cross-generational familial truths that the prolific director/co-writer lovingly metes out.", "It soon becomes clear that they have planned their trip at a bad time; it is equally clear that every time is a bad time.", "With its debt to Leo McCarey's 'Make Way for Tomorrow,' Yasujiro Ozu's 'Tokyo Story' is no less true, shattering, and not for viewers fretting about unsympathetic grown-up children.", "In this exquisite merging of specific and universal, infinite and infinitesimal, Tokyo Story perhaps most clearly illuminates that Ozu is not the most Japanese of filmmakers, but the most human.", "Ozu's long shots, knee-high camera placement, and collapsed perspective -- as gorgeous and unsettling as a C\u00e9zanne -- gather power over the duration, but time itself is the master's most potent weapon.", "Ozu has made a film as simple in form and complex in nature as life itself. Here, every viewer is cast as a tourist, and yet will feel right at home.", "These characters never surprise us with anything showy, lurid, or sensational. They're ordinary human beings, treated with fierce attention that feels like deep respect.", "This remains one of the most approachable and moving of all cinema's masterpieces.", "Ozu may have made subtler films, but the clarity of his social critique here is wrenching and unassailable.", "Newcomers to Ozu must be prepared for a rigidly controlled work with no mobile-camera shots. This style elegantly frames the delicate performances, which in turn do justice to the wisdom and compassion of Ozu's view of life.", "Ostensibly a snapshot of postwar Japan in the midst of profound cultural change, it is the movie's painful depiction of familial disintegration that remains universal today.", "This 1953 classic is one of the cinema's most profound and moving studies of married love, ageing and the relations between parents and children. It is flawless and rewards numerous viewings."], "rating": ["8/10", "5/5", "", "5/5", "", "", "5/5", "1", "A+", "1", "", "4/4", "", "", "9.5/10", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Yasser Medina", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Rob Aldam", "PJ Nabarro", "Asher Luberto", "Arthur Ross", "Matt Neal", "Tim Brayton", "Cole Smithey", "Christopher Long", "Donald J.
