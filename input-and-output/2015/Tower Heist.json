{"metadata": {"synopsis": "For more than 10 years, Josh Kovaks (Ben Stiller) has managed one of New York City's most luxurious and well-secured residences. One of the condo's most-notorious residents, Arthur Shaw (Alan Alda), is currently under house arrest for the theft of more than $2 billion from his investors -- including Josh and his co-workers. Determined to reclaim the retirement funds Shaw stole from them, they turn to a petty crook named Slide (Eddie Murphy) to help them break into Shaw's home.", "rating": "68", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Brett Ratner", "studio": "BrianGrazer", "theater_date": "Nov 4, 2011", "dvd_date": "Mar 26, 2013", "box_office": "$78.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A film that carefully fleshes out its subjects before building scene after scene of increasingly clever lunacy.", "It's a funny and heartfelt film with a strong ensemble cast.", "It's a middle-of-the-road comedy in which the good outweighs the bad.", "The movie is an uninspired rehash of caper movie tropes that tries to be quirky only to fail.", "In the end Tower Heist is serviceable not great or something to run right out to see opening night. It might be great to watch on constant TNT reruns in the future though.", "Fun, fast-paced popcorn entertainment that works reasonably well as long as you avoid thinking about how patently ridiculous it is.", "When Murphy is on screen, Tower Heist really sizzles. But even when Murphy isn't around, Tower Heist is still good enough to satisfy moviegoers looking for a mildly entertaining comic diversion.", "No, it's not A Beautiful Mind, but it's a wildly entertaining and funny movie.", "The particulars of the smash'n'grab are so ridiculous - just how do you swipe a priceless car from a 50th floor apartment? - you just have to keep watching to see how they are going to pull it off.", "A poor man's version of Ocean's 11.", "Let's just get this off our chests right now: Tower Heist is not a great movie.", "This action comedy's heart is in the right place, but its screenplay and direction are not.", "'Tower Heist' is a low-rent payback caper involving the staff of the titular high-rent tower. It's Donald Trump's Tower. Oddly, The Donald doesn't have a cameo.", "A crappy Hollywood blockbuster for the Occupy movement.", "It is a heist movie that doesn't care about the heist.", "The one-liners pop and the cast delivers.", "All corners of the oddball comedy genre are squarely covered in a way that somehow seems fresh despite the well tried-and-tested formula.", "What we end up with is a film that will have you laughing all the way through while at the same time reminding you that some talent never goes away, it just hibernates in smaller or inferior movies for awhile before that right project reaches them.", "Tower Heist is too much fun too dislike. It may not be the smartest or even the funniest film of the year, but it does feature one very entertaining ensemble that makes for a great ride.", "Feels more like a droll drama than an actual comedy, and it could have worked on those merits, but the stilted comedic asides rob the film of genuine weight."], "rating": ["8/10", "3.0/4", "B-", "C-", "C-", "2.5/4", "", "8/10", "3/5", "C", "C-", "2/4", "2.5/5", "", "C", "3/4", "4/5", "3/4", "7.5/10", "3.5/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "Brent McKnight", "Julian Lytle", "Matthew Lucas", "Micheal Compton", "Debbie Baldwin", "Leigh Paatsch", "Kiko Martinez", "Candice Frederick", "Dwight Brown", "Mark Jackson", "Sean Burns", "Will Leitch", "Roger Moore", "Matt Looker", "Jeff Beck", "Benjo Colautti", "William Bibbiani"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Ignorant Bliss", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Ladue News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Antonio Current", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Talk Online", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">National Newspaper Publishers Association", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Epoch Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Deadspin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tribune News Service", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheShiznit.co.uk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Examiner.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">We Got This Covered", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CraveOnline"], "date": ["November 30, 2020", "September 26, 2020", "August 4, 2020", "July 11, 2020", "January 11, 2020", "June 8, 2019", "May 7, 2019", "November 10, 2018", "July 12, 2018", "January 26, 2018", "September 8, 2017", "November 14, 2016", "July 3, 2016", "May 3, 2015", "June 23, 2013", "December 29, 2012", "September 25, 2012", "September 18, 2012", "September 17, 2012", "August 22, 2012"]}}
