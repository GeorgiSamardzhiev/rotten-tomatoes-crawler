{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Based on Homer's \"Iliad,\" this epic portrays the battle between the ancient kingdoms of Troy and Sparta. While visiting Spartan King Menelaus (Brendan Gleeson), Trojan prince Paris (Orlando Bloom) falls for Menelaus' wife, Helen (Diane Kruger), and takes her back to Troy. Menelaus' brother, King Agamemnon (Brian Cox), having already defeated every army in Greece, uses his brother's fury as a pretext to declare war against Troy, the last kingdom preventing his control over the Aegean Sea.", "rating": "54", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h 42m", "director": "Wolfgang Petersen", "studio": "VillageRoadshowProd.,PlanBFilms,RadiantPictures,WarnerBrothers", "theater_date": "May 13, 2004", "dvd_date": "Mar 1, 2013", "box_office": "$133.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["With all the over-the-top costumes and sets, it looks more like a television movie of the week than a big summer event flick.", "The real problem with Petersen and Benioff's reductive ideological updating of the epic story they tell is organic, not pedantic: the \"realism\" they've opted for goes against the grain of the genre they're working in.", "Brad is worth the ticket price alone and others turned in creditable performances, particularly Eric Bana as an upright family man who just happens to be the prince of a warlike city-state, and Sean Bean as Odysseus the Ironic.", "overblown historical epic", "An adaptation of The Iliad that would have had to work much harder to miss the point of The Iliad any more thoroughly.", "Violent, watered-down version of The Iliad.", "While an achievement in visuals, Troy fails in every other aspect including its writing and storytelling.", "Despite its shortcomings, Troy is a visual smorgasbord.", "The face-off between Achilles and Hector is beautifully realized, all the more wounding because we can precisely read each man's emotions going into the fight.", "It's coherent at least.
