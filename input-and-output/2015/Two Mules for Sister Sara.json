{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When gunslinger Hogan (Clint Eastwood) discovers a group of men attempting to rape a young nun, Sara (Shirley MacLaine), he shoots them dead and rescues the woman. The two escape to a nearby camp of Mexican revolutionaries, who have hired Hogan to help fight the invading French army. En route, Sara turns out to be surprisingly crude for a nun, drinking, smoking and using curse words. When she also proves to be handy with a gun, Hogan begins wondering if she is telling him the whole truth.", "rating": "69", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Western", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "Don Siegel", "studio": "Universal/UniversalInt", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 7, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...only a moderate success.", "While the two men are best known for subverting the tropes of action pictures, they accomplished something a bit more enticing by casting a wide net and integrating a top tier actor like Shirley MacLaine into their hyper-masculine world.", "Clint Eastwood and Shirley MacLaine make an unlikely but surprisingly effective team in this enjoyable Western.", "It has a number of things going for it, chief among them a feeling for the landscape of Mexico (photographed by Gabriel Figueroa) which probably has never before been duplicated.", "The resurrection of cliches is always a dubious proposition, but the revival of ones that were vulgar from the start strikes me as little short of insanity.", "Plenty of drinking, flirtations, and short tempers are shared, and while the movie doesn't offer an overwhelming sense of conflict, sly personalities and chewy western traditions are big enough to capture attention.", "OK Eastwood, but MacLaine as bawdy nun is more than a bit too over.", "", "Siegel shoots in beautiful widescreen and keeps the action scrappy and pulpy, just like his best \"B\" movies.", "The movie is a lot better than it might have been.", "It shows in a one-joke situation that rapidly wears thin, in tension that doesn't hold up, in acting that is never up to snuff.", "", "Not Clint's best, but a fairly unique and entertaining western.", "A vital component of the Siegel-Eastwood connection.", "", "It's all predictable and formulaic; it could have used a big time rewrite."], "rating": ["", "B", "3/4", "", "", "B", "3/5", "B-", "3.5/4", "2.5/4", "", "4/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3/5", "C"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Dennis Harvey", "James Clay", "Matt Brunson", "Richard R.
