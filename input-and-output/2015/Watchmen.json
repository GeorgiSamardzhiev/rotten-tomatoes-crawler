{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In an alternate 1985 America, costumed superheroes are part of everyday life. When one of his former comrades is murdered, masked vigilante Rorschach (Jackie Earle Haley) uncovers a plot to kill and discredit all past and present superheroes. As he reconnects with his retired associates, only one of which has true powers, Rorschach glimpses a far-reaching conspiracy involving their shared past and catastrophic consequences for the world's future.", "rating": "65", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 43m", "director": "Zack Snyder", "studio": "LawrenceGordonProductions,LloydLevin", "theater_date": "Mar 6, 2009", "dvd_date": "Dec 31, 2010", "box_office": "$107.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The story is difficult to follow, the dialogue is both juvenile and pretentious, the acting is thoroughly uneven, the look and feel of the film are essentially without character or personality, and its social outlook is disoriented at best.", "There's no shortage of nudity and graphic bloodshed as the fate of the world rests on the shoulders of psychopaths.", "Better than expected but too often falling short.", "If Watchmen doesn't earn comic-book movies the utmost respect, nothing ever will.", "The essence of what made [Alan] Moore's tale a work of genius is up on the screen for all to see, and it looks phenomenal.", "The world is ready for Watchmen, and I'll certainly be lining up to watch the Watchmen again.", "When given a great story and told that his job is to simply adapt it, Snyder more than rises to the occasion.", "[An] obnoxious, bloated, ghastly piece of brightly colored pop trash.", "For the most part, Watchmen is an engrossing and very adult entry into the comic book genre.", "Even with [its] failings, Watchmen is still atmospheric and entertaining.", "The failure of this very faithful adaptation highlights the fact that to capture the spirit of a comic book, a film must do more than bring a collection of still frames to life.", "You pay for the inventive frontloading, however. Most of the rest of the movie stretches out like the Gobi Desert, one hell of a plod between oases.", "The only way to truly adhere to Alan Moore's vision of Watchmen would be to not make the movie in the first place.", "Watchmen isn't your typical caper flick filled with kickass effects and gunfire and no premise.", "[Zack] Snyder's Watchmen is mechanical, heartless and, tragically, hollow.", "A remarkable film, in many respects.", "Those unfamiliar with the work may be completely bewildered, but stick with it -- this is a bold and uncompromising take on one of the genre's sacred cows that stands up to repeat viewings.", "For such an epic spectacle, it's not burdened by a lot of clutter. It's intellectual complexity seems well-earned, not gratuitous. It's also visually stunning.", "I truly wanted to love Watchmen, but I never warmed up to it and ended up only liking it in parts.", "Undeniably, skilfully and wholeheartedly realized by Zack Snyder, the impossible now exists: Watchmen isn't just a movie, it's a great movie."], "rating": ["", "8/10", "2.5/4", "", "5/5", "4/5", "3.5/4", "1.5/4", "B", "3/5", "", "", "", "B+", "2/5", "3.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "3.5/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Larry Nichols", "Nikki Baughan", "Kate Rodger", "Matthew Rozsa", "Matthew Lucas", "Micheal Compton", "Kaleem Aftab", "Kaleem Aftab", "Eileen Jones", "Matt Singer", "Candice Frederick", "Aaron Asadi", "David Keyes", "Jamie Russell", "Brian D.
