{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Jacob Jankowski (Robert Pattinson), a veterinary student, is close to graduating when a terrible tragedy forces him to leave school. With nowhere else to go, he hops on a passing train and finds it belongs to a traveling circus.

Their shared compassion for a special elephant named Rosie leads to love, but August (Christoph Waltz), Marlena's cruel husband, stands in their way.", "rating": "60", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 1m", "director": "Francis Lawrence", "studio": "3ArtsEntertainment,Flashpoint,GilNetter", "theater_date": "Apr 22, 2011", "dvd_date": "Oct 1, 2016", "box_office": "$58.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Proof that Oscar winner Christoph Waltz is no one-hit wonder.", "It's a grand, naturally cinematic story, but despite a sumptuous production it just doesn't live up to its full potential.", "\"Elephants\" works, despite its plodding and predictable love triangle. This is a movie that, when the focus is on life under the big top, is quite engaging and just good enough to be a mildly surprising spring diversion.", "Water for Elephants is a well-done and engaging film. Something about it holds us at a slight remove...but overall, it works.", "One gets the sense, watching this predictable but dazzling film, that we all lost something when the circus became safer, but less thrilling.", "Lacks the romantic luster needed between its leads to match the enchanting, saga-like feel of the time.", "While ultimately forgettable, it's a pleasant enough diversion while it's happening.", "[Water for Elephants] is an old-fashioned romance done with loving period detail.", "This movie doesn't have half the imagination of even the most subpar circus and, all told, I think it even has fewer elephants.", "The leads lack chemistry and the movie has a very cookie-cutter love story that was far too predictable.", "Whatever romance Gruen summoned forth from this rough and tumble world of show people living by their own laws in a traveling, self-contained world of poverty and cruelty, director Francis Lawrence has hacked and ground it off.", "\"Water for Elephants\" is a surprisingly good film that once again shows that first impressions aren't everything.", "", "", "Effectively hits the right emotional beats with crucially the right amount of restraint.", "I love it when a film surprises me.", "The film is certainly striking to look at but the story is hackneyed with too much exposition", "It plays like a book with half of its pages ripped out. It moves quickly enough, but it's never convincing and the actors never get much to chew on. The end result isn't really a 'whirlwind' romance; it's more like a tumbleweed.", "The real appeal of this movie is the epic backdrop of the 1930s-era train circus.
