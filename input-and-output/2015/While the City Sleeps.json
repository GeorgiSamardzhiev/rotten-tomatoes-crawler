{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A serial killer is on the loose in New York City. Dubbed \"The Lipstick Killer,\" he has also strangely become the center of a power struggle between three division chiefs in a media empire. The directive from their inexperienced boss, Walter Kyne (Vincent Price), is simple: Whoever catches the killer gets promoted to executive editor. But newspaper editor John Day Griffith (Thomas Mitchell) has one distinct advantage in the form of crack reporter Edward Mobley (Dana Andrews).", "rating": "89", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Fritz Lang", "studio": "RKOPictures", "theater_date": "May 30, 1956", "dvd_date": "Oct 30, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The result is very interesting with the argument of the very cynical way in which hierarchy and influences in the political world of journalism are handled.
