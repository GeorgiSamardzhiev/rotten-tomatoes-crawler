{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The people of Detroit know 8 Mile as the city limit, a border, a boundary. It is also a psychological dividing line that separates Jimmy Smith Jr. (Eminem) from where and who he wants to be.

Instead, it tells a simple story of trial, error and triumph.", "Since his ascension to pop-culture royalty, Eminem has transformed the messy emotions of his life into musical black comedy. In 8 Mile, that life becomes an equally riveting drama.", "Despite the predictable formula, screenwriter Scott Silver wisely avoids taking the easy route every time; there are several small twists you may not expect, and the ending isn't entirely a happy one.", "Because it rejects easy victories, this may be one of the few inspirational movies that could actually inspire someone, somewhere, sometime.", "The movie has some of the braggadocio of its white-trash hero, building to its competitive climax as if it were a gladiatorial sporting event, and it carried me all the way.", "While no masterpiece, it is infinitely superior to the sad movie debuts of Britney Spears and Mariah Carey."], "rating": ["2/5", "2/5", "3.5/5", "", "A-", "", "7/10", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "3.5/5", "", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Justin Brown", "Brandon Collins", "Leigh Paatsch", "Mark Steyn", "Joel Siegel", "Barbara Ellen", "Tim Brayton", "Joe Morgenstern", "David Denby", "Jami Bernard", "John Powers", "Tom Gliatto", "Adam Smith", "", "Khary Kimani Turner", "Nathan Rabin", "Christy Lemire", "Richard Schickel", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Philip French"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Medium Popcorn", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Medium Popcorn", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Good Morning America", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">L.A.
