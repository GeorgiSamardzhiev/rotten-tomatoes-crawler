Every scene feels perfectly composed, with everything in the shot having a purpose and nothing out of place.", "It has all of the trappings of a gangster epic without actually understanding how to use those trappings or why they work.", "As excellent as Chastain is in a role that finally gives her something to chew on, the film belongs to Isaac's suave, mostly well-intentioned businessman.", "J.C Chandor controls the screen with his gripping atmosphere that keeps you guessing.", "All the elements you want from a movie called A Most Violent Year are present, but not in the genre-fulfilling forms you may hope to be sated by.", "carefully calculated but struggles under its weighty self-importance", "Simmering with drama, A Most Violent Year is one of the best films yet from Isaac or Chandor, and that's saying something.", "Chandor's screenplay is taut and understated, complemented by superb acting, and creates an immersive experience of time and place.", "The scintillating A Most Violent Year highlights what has been the through-line of Chandor's terrific career to date; the struggle to survive.", "Atmospheric and intense, consider this a sort of anti-Goodfellas, but something Martin Scorsese would value wholeheartedly.", "Though this classily directed and compellingly acted film won't be everyone's cup of tea, what it's trying to communicate about success ... is definitely worth thinking about.", "The direction is strong, the acting solid, and the cinematography crisp.", "Like Al Pacino before him, [Oscar Isaac's] silent reserve is truly frightening.", "The New York of that era leaves its mark on the screen. There is a lot to learn from the ruins.
