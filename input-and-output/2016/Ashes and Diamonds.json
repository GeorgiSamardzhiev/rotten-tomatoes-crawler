{"metadata": {"synopsis": "It's May 1945, and Nazi Germany has just surrendered. The war is over, but not in Poland. As the German soldiers vacate, the remaining Russian forces and Polish resistance fighters must work out the hierarchies of power in \"liberated\" Communist Poland. A Polish assassin (Zbigniew Cybulski) is given orders to kill a Russian soldier (Waclaw Zastrzezynsky) whom he, days before, was fighting alongside, and this moral conflict makes him question the goals for which he has been fighting.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Art House & International/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Andrzej Wajda", "studio": "ZespolFilmowy&quot;Kadr&quot;", "theater_date": "May 29, 1961", "dvd_date": "Mar 20, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This honest film shows a greater degree of artistic and political freedom in Poland (at least in 1959) than we are led to expect.", "One has heard for some time that Wajda's Ashes and Diamonds is the masterpiece of the postwar Polish cinema and finally I've seen it. Not bad... Essentially a sophisticated thriller, with a class angle, of course.", "Complex, tender, agonising, it makes a country's moral dilemma as personal as love, and the pain of moral disillusion as immediate a torment as, say, disillusion in love.", "Honest, brutally powerful and often shocking.", "Richly composed and photographed, with atmosphere aplenty, Ashes and Diamonds suffers somewhat from an excess of loose plot ends and of underdeveloped characters, perhaps a consequence of having been based on a prestigious novel.", "Wajda's deeply romantic and personal vision, inspired by both Italian neo-realism and by the more baroque images of Expressionism, makes Ashes and Diamonds a gripping experience.", "When you watch Ashes And Diamonds, remember, you're not just seeing a film: you're looking at a manifesto that has found a voice and a face and speaks for a whole deceived generation.", "Only Wajda, though, could muster such a mood, with everyone feeding on smoke and booze, and the assembled company, at the end, dancing to a cracked polonaise.", "The final installment in Andrzej Wajda's war trilogy - following \"A Generation\" (1954) and \"Kanal\" (1956) - is a coolly romantic wartime movie about Maciek, a young Polish resistance fighter whose demise coincides with Germany's surrender.", "Taut thriller about immediate postwar Poland also has a heavier theme of the futility of killing and violence. Its technical knowhow, fine acting and directorial prowess make this an above average drama.", "The third panel in Wajda WWII trilogy (that began with Generation and continued with Kanal) is considered one of his best works; it also shows why Cybulski was labeled the Polish James Dean.", "This taut political thriller is a fine example of one of the first Polish New Wave films.", "Wajda's way is the sweet smell of excess, but some scenes remain powerfully memorable -- the lighting of drinks on the bar, the upturned Christ in a bombed church, and Cybulski's prolonged death agonies at the close.", "This great film by Andrzej Wajda is considered the greatest Polish film ever made, and I'm sure that's not too far off the mark.", "", "", "", "Hailed as a masterpiece by others, Ashes and Diamonds failed to capture my imagination", "An overlooked masterpiece of Eastern European cinema, this eminently powerful and sophisticated drama delicately dissects issues and themes rarely visited by war movies.", "Zbigniew Cybulski as the hero is sensitive, attractive and alert -- a lad with humor and compassion. One is strongly drawn to him."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "A+", "", "A", "A-", "", "4/4", "3/5", "3/5", "5/5", "2.5/4", "", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Merl Edelman", "Dwight MacDonald", "Isabel Quigly", "", "", "Derek Malcolm", "Alexander Walker", "Anthony Lane", "Cole Smithey", "Variety Staff", "Emanuel Levy", "Dennis Schwartz", "", "Jeffrey M.
