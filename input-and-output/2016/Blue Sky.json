The move to Alabama sends her into the arms of base commander Vince Johnson (Powers Boothe).", "rating": "79", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Tony Richardson", "studio": "OrionPictures", "theater_date": "Sep 16, 1994", "dvd_date": "Oct 1, 2016", "box_office": "$2.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Indeed, it is Lange's performance that still holds this film together...
