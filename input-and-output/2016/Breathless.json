{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Petty thug Michel (Jean-Paul Belmondo) considers himself a suave bad guy in the manner of Humphrey Bogart, but panics and impulsively kills a policeman while driving a stolen car. On the lam, he turns to his aspiring journalist girlfriend, Patricia (Jean Seberg), hiding out in her Paris apartment while he tries to pull together enough money to get the pair to Italy. But when Patricia learns that her boyfriend is being investigated for murder, she begins to question her loyalties.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Jean-Luc Godard", "studio": "Imperia,LesFilmsGeorgesdeBeauregard", "theater_date": "Feb 7, 1961", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$404.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An irreverent French spin on Godard's affection for American gangster movies...", "It's an upbeat, jazzy, cops-and-robbers crime drama with the tone of a romantic comedy and the plot progression of an unfocused documentary.", "Godard's camera lingers on movement, and on the spaces between people. In one instance, he cuts from Michel and Patricia's flirtations to a close-up of their locked lips, where the space between them has been suddenly and irrevocably shattered.", "Breathless must have seemed amazing in 1960, a movie obsessed with youth and motion. The problem with youth is it doesn't last.", "Exhilarating... Godard uses his camera with the freedom of the gifted amateur who is innocent of all the conventions that the professionals have developed to take the edge off visual reality.", "Godard is, in a sense, flaunting how he can make a film so vibrant, out of raw materials so flighty, so airy (the 'Breathless' of the title).", "A hip, jokey thriller in which the sketchy plot serves as an excuse for stylistic flourishes and philosophical asides.", "Indisputably on the shortlist of Movies You Need To See if you're going to have a proper conception of cinema history and the potential of cinematic form.", "With the appearance of Breathless, we have a film that is new, aesthetically and morally.", "[VIDEO ESSAY] Goddard arrived at a kinesthetic technique of jagged cutting during the editing process as a way to speed up the action - to prune out the boring stuff.", "A unique hybrid, both the realization of years of critical writings by Godard and ... also a film made by an unabashed cinephile.", "With Breathless [Godard] is attempting to break down the rules of the form he loves so much, in order to let us know that it is ALL on the table now, from subject matter to form.", "", "The film that launched the French New Wave, Breathless remains an outstanding testament to the great ideals of fun filmmaking that infused the movement.", "", "", "", "To me, and I suspect to most cinephiles, this is the rush that makes moviegoing addictive: the sensation that the film's world was so full that it has spilled into the sights and sounds beyond the theater's doors.", "Together, like their countermelodies, Michel and Patricia form a zero-sum game-nothing matters.
