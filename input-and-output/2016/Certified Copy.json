{"metadata": {"synopsis": "While touring Tuscany, Italy, promoting his new book, English author James (William Shimell) meets French store owner Elle (Juliette Binoche), and the two hit it off, deciding to spend a free day together. They travel to a nearby town, get coffee, visit a museum and pretend to be recently married in what turns out to be a popular wedding destination. As these two strangers get to know each other, however, it becomes clear there's more to their new relationship than meets the eye.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Abbas Kiarostami", "studio": "RaiCinema", "theater_date": "Mar 11, 2011", "dvd_date": "Mar 10, 2017", "box_office": "$1.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Binoche is simply extraordinary here.", "The philosophical dialogues and performances of Shimell and Binoche, stimulate our senses with an emotional resonance that is at times enigmatic. [Full review in Spanish]", "The truth hides somewhere in [the] collision of being and non-being, always just out of reach.", "...this mobius strip of a movie feels lop-sided. We feel Binoche is doing all the heavy-lifting and Shimmel is just along for the ride.", "For the loved, for the lost, for the wounded, Certified Copy is a cathartic and rapturous journey of the heart that won't soon be forgotten.", "[William Shimell's] an engaging presence, cool and confident in front of the camera.", "It's all pure Kiarostami, but Certified Copy is also supremely European, serving as an antidote to the clich\u00e9d Hollywood romance.", "It's a masterful essay on the value of art, but the slow burner does take a little too long to come to the boil.", "Binoche is as always spectacular... [Full review in Spanish]", "Kiarostami adopts a lush visual scheme and almost lighthearted tone that provides levity to a remarkably demanding work, one that's as playfully deceptive and cunning as anything the director has made before.", "In many respects, Certified Copy is every bit as elliptical and provocative as more transparently \"experimental\" films.", "Imagine a cinematic equivalent of a Picasso cubist portrait, but instead of showing multiple perspectives of an object in an image, it presents experiences from different periods in a life in a single narrative.", "While the people those characters encounter readily buy into their story as moviegoers ordinarily would, Mr. Kiarostami invites his viewers to second-guess his film and their own perceptions.", "Certified Copy reminded me why I love movies.", "Abbas Kiarostami's Tuscan sun-dappled enigma is the cinematic gift that is going to keep on giving for decades.", "Binoche and Shimell keep us fully engaged with their characters throughout their conversations, and Kiarostami draws us in with his signature mixture of long takes and intimate close-ups", "...impossibly romantic.", "I could assess the performances (Juliette Binoche is better than ever). ... But I can't treat Certified Copy with a critic's typical detachment. I'm in love with it.", "Kiarostami has woven together a veritable tapestry of the mind: here a stray thought, there an oft-disputed theory.", "Tal vez intentar buscar respuestas a tantas preguntas sea no slo una prdida de tiempo sino contradecir el discurso sin ataduras que nos propone Kiarostami, lleno de interrogantes que no pretenden ser respondidas."], "rating": ["3.0/4", "7/10", "", "", "3.5/4", "3/5", "4/5", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "", "9/10", "3/4", "3.5/4", "A+", "4/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Yasser Medina", "Keith Uhlich", "Brian D.
