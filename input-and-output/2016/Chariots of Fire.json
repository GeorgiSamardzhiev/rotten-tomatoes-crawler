{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the class-obsessed and religiously divided United Kingdom of the early 1920s, two determined young runners train for the 1924 Paris Olympics. Eric Liddell (Ian Charleson), a devout Christian born to Scottish missionaries in China, sees running as part of his worship of God's glory and refuses to train or compete on the Sabbath. Harold Abrahams (Ben Cross) overcomes anti-Semitism and class bias, but neglects his beloved sweetheart Sybil (Alice Krige) in his single-minded quest.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Sports & Fitness", "runtime": "2h 3m", "director": "Hugh Hudson", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,AlliedStars", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 2, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The sequences that could have been unmistakably victorious are flatly documentary-like at best.", "Devoid of active conflict or any sort of narrative engine.", "[Ian Charleson and [Ben Cross] bring an unrestrained passion to their roles that is both refreshing and invigorating to watch.", "While the audience doesn't fully experience the spookiness of the sports arena where pain and ecstasy shake hands, it is given more than gratuitous glimpses into the lives of two young men out to better their best.", "\"Chariots of Fire\" reveals the origins of the modern Olympic competitive mindset; the doping, lying, and cheating. Lance Armstrong, anyone? This is the true story of two 1924 Olypians; one a man of deep faith, the other wanting to win at all costs.", "Hugh Hudson maintains the dramatic game in its psychological, social, and intriguing ambitions. [Full Review in Spanish]", "This sumptuously produced true story of two very different runners who became the stars and national heroes of Britain's 1924 Olympic team manages to blend the exquisite color and excitement of sport with deeper emotional and spiritual elements.", "It reminds us of the affirmative aspects of life, of the hope that endures in it as well as the cynicism.", "Despite its bombastic tendencies, Chariots has a healthy glow that's charming.", "It is an affirmation of clouded and second-hand values -- and, as a result, it becomes vulgar.", "The film is not just about the race between Abrahams, the Jewish law student (Ben Cross), and Scottish missionary Eric Liddell (the late Ian Charleson). It's a character study and a social history too.", "From the opening scene of pale young men racing barefoot along the beach, full of hope and elation, backed by Vangelis's now famous anthem, the film is utterly compelling.", "Oddly, for a film about triumph over adversity, there's nothing as uplifting as the opening and closing jogs along a windswept beach.", "The appeal will always be there for people to revisit Hudson's award-winner in a year of both the Queen's Diamond Jubilee and the Olympics, despite perhaps being remembered a little too fondly.", "A movie that, with the help of Vangelis Papathanassiou's wonderfully stirring music, lifts the spirits to a new high.", "This 31-year-old Oscar winning true-life drama climaxing at the 1924 games proved a winner all the way. And it still is.", "Vigorous but rather scattered.", "Chariots is a film for the ages.", "Sir John Gielgud and Patrick Magee head up -- but don't show up -- director Hugh Hudson's excellent cast of mostly unknown British actors. The cinematography, too, is splendid.", "Granted, this is a British film and so you expect a restrained, understated reaction from the runners, but it's this decided lack of fun that makes the movie drag so much."], "rating": ["4/10", "2.5/5", "2.5/4", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "5/5", "2/5", "3/5", "", "1", "", "5/5", "", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Tim Brayton", "Larry Vitacco", "Lawrence O&#39;Toole", "Mark Jackson", "Diego Gal\u00e1n", "Rick Chatenever", "Bruce McCabe", "Gary Arnold", "Peter Ackroyd", "Derek Malcolm", "Kate Muir", "Dave Calhoun", "Joseph Walsh", "Kathleen Carroll", "Alan Frank", "David Sterritt", "Ian Freer", "People Staff", "Scott Nash"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternate Ending", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Gay News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Maclean&#39;s Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Epoch Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Santa Cruz Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Globe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Star (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Three Movie Buffs"], "date": ["August 31, 2020", "August 1, 2020", "May 27, 2020", "February 5, 2020", "November 11, 2019", "August 21, 2019", "February 5, 2019", "April 26, 2018", "August 4, 2015", "August 4, 2015", "February 21, 2015", "February 21, 2015", "February 21, 2015", "February 21, 2015", "February 17, 2015", "February 25, 2014", "February 25, 2014", "January 10, 2014", "January 10, 2014", "February 22, 2013"]}}
