{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Awkward teenager Charlie Bartlett (Anton Yelchin) has trouble fitting in at a new high school. Charlie needs some friends fast, and decides that the best way to find them is to appoint himself the resident psychiatrist.

The film succeeds only in pissing off the viewer.", "", "", "The promising themes peter out as the film loses direction, though, and Bartlett is neither sympathetic enough to root for nor dumb enough to laugh at.", "Lightweight fare, but a pleasant outing.", "Charlie Bartlett plays it too safe.", "", "Charlie Bartlett is a poor man's Rushmore. There is a great film waiting to be made about psychiatry, anti-depressants and our youth, but this isn't it.", "Mostly this was a quirky, smart, inspiring, and surprisingly enjoyable High School movie.", "Robert Downey Jr. playing an alcoholic principal lecturing on the dangers of drugs is one of those wonderfully ironic, Twilight Zone moments that only Hollywood can provide.", "Charlie Bartlett is the Ferris Bueller of our drug addled age. Except he's not a fraction of the charmer ol' Ferris was.", "The movie is extremely hilarious, yet very serious and emotional at the same time.", "There are plenty of good qualities in Charlie; it just needed to apply itself a little more.", "Hugely entertaining high school drama with a delightfully offbeat script and terrific performances from a superb cast.", "Charlie Bartlett is not terrible - but in the crowded market of teen comedies, you need to work a whole lot harder to be top of the class, or even to sit at the back with the cool kids.", "[F]eels like little more than an amalgam of great moments from the John Hughes oeuvre as well as from Thumbsucker, Pump Up the Volume and Over the Edge, among others."], "rating": ["6/10", "", "", "2/4", "", "3.5/5", "B", "2/5", "", "2/4", "3/5", "3/10", "3/4", "", "2/4", "4/5", "3/5", "4/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Jason Best", "Kelly Vance", "Mike Scott", "Fernando F.
