And while the live action distinguishes it from its cartoon predecessor of 1973, it makes it bear entirely too much resemblance to the Babe series.", "Hides a big heart beneath a small piglet.", "There's enough of White's original spirit that survives the Hollywoodization to keep the little girls happy.", "Steve Buscemi's invigorating vocal characterization of Templeton the rat is the only high point in this sleep-inducing live action-animated revamp of the 1973 animated classic based on E.B White's 1952 children's book.", "In this live action movie, with talking animals and a good deal of clever computer-generated imagery, Julia Roberts does the talking for Charlotte and only confirmed arachnophobes such as myself will resist her charms.", "If you can identify all the voices before the credits roll up, you are a better man than I.", "Hilarious and heart-warming, this is a real crowd-pleaser for all ages.", "Most of the problem is that everything feels very familiar, while the movie's moralising tone grates very quickly.", "Hardly the equal of Babe but the superior voice cast and Fanning's unforced charm make for another film that'll put you off pork forever.", "This film does what all children's films should do: not just offer lots of entertaining things to look at, but teach children how to look at the world with curiosity, attentiveness and joy.", "It's hard to go wrong with a cute liddle piggy.", "Adult audiences tend to find [Dakota Fanning] rather shrill - witnessing [her] at full shriek is like being attacked by a colony of bats. For this reason, Charlotte's Web is probably one for youngsters only.", "If they'd stopped yammering for just a few minutes, White's heartbreaking ending might have retained its poignancy. As it is, it's little more than a blessed relief.", "Never less than watchable, thanks to its superb cast, but kids will enjoy it more than adults will.", "Youngsters will warm to the barn's talking animals and perhaps even shed a tear at the sight of a spider shuffling off the mortal coil.
