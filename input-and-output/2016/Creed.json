{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Adonis Johnson (Michael B. Jordan) never knew his famous father, boxing champion Apollo Creed, who died before Adonis was born. However, boxing is in his blood, so he seeks out Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) and asks the retired champ to be his trainer. Rocky sees much of Apollo in Adonis, and agrees to mentor him, even as he battles an opponent deadlier than any in the ring. With Rocky's help, Adonis soon gets a title shot, but whether he has the true heart of a fighter remains to be seen.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 13m", "director": "Ryan Coogler", "studio": "ChartoffWinkler", "theater_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "dvd_date": "Aug 21, 2016", "box_office": "$109.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Proves the blend of boxing and underdogs is still a potent mix, made better by rich performances and Stallone's quietly affecting work.", "Creed will make you stand up to cheer and leave you wishing for one more round.", "With all of the redundancies in plot and imagery, it might as well have been one long montage of scenes pulled from the previous six pictures.", "Creed hits hardest thanks to a never-better Stallone. Some actors get better with age. Others fade into the distance, taken over by younger talents never to be found again...", "There's an incredible empowerment in Creed that speaks volumes to our current generation. With Stallone representing the past, he passes on the boxing and life metaphor torch to Michael B. Jordan which he seizes with open arms.", "Although the narrative follows the basic pattern of the previous films, Coogler and Jordan infuse it with an identity all its own. There's a level of grit that hasn't been seen since the original.", "The best \"Rocky\" movie since \"Rocky,\" but it more than stands on it's own merits.", "Being a sequel and spin-off, it rejuvenates the past glory of Rocky's world with a round of good performances from Sylvester Stallone and Michael B. Jordan. [Full review in Spanish]", "Rocky has always been about heart, and 40 years into the franchise, it would seem there's still plenty to spare.", "Cynics could easily latch on to the problems above and dismiss CREED as franchise smelling salts. To do so, however, would be to also dismiss the new talent Coogler and Jordan bring to the creaking joints of the ROCKY brand.", "We're lucky to have Creed. With most franchises, the seventh installment wouldn't even be in theaters, much less worth a damn.", "Placing focus on the young Creed allows Jordan to breathe his youthful talents into the film. He successfully carries the weight of being the main focal point.", "Creed goes the distance and then some.", "[Ryan] Coogler proves to be a great action director with his close, seamless fight shots, while capturing uncheesy sports montages and intimate interactions.", "'Creed' is not a novelty, but it is different enough from the first installment of the franchise. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Adonis' presence splits the cinematic illusion like a prism, as it hops back and forth between fighters. In one moment, Adonis punches alongside Apollo, embracing his legacy. In the next, he rejects it, fighting Apollo himself.", "Creed is a meditation on fatherlessness, a call-to-arms for black youth who are taught lowered expectations to believe they are powerful, a rousing boxing flick, a quality love story, and one of the best damn films of the year.", "What's disappointing about Creed is how slavishly it follows the template of the previous pictures. It's not bad -- it's the best entry since Rocky III -- but one's enjoyment depends entirely on how charitable one is feeling in the nostalgia department.", "Director Ryan Coogler gives the film a surprisingly indy feel for such a mainstream franchise.", "Ryan Coogler, an accomplished talent after just two films, wisely trades in the authenticity of 'televising' Creed's bouts, a platitudinous technique used so ubiquitously in boxing movies, for intimate handycam..."], "rating": ["3.5/5", "3.5/4", "3/10", "", "5/5", "B+", "B+", "7/10", "", "", "", "", "3.5/5", "4/5", "", "", "A", "2.5/4", "A", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Leo Brady", "Mike Massie", "Dan Buffa", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Allen Almachar", "Brent McKnight", "Yasser Medina", "Dan Scully", "Jim Ross", "Tim Brennan", "Phumlani S Langa", "David Harris", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Mikel Zorrilla", "Siddhant Adlakha", "Ryan Syrek", "Matt Brunson", "Rachel Wagner", "Christopher Preston"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AMovieGuy.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KSDK News (St. Louis)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Confessions From A Geek Mind", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema76", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TAKE ONE Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">About Boulder", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">City Press (South Africa)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Musings of Guitargalchina", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slashfilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Reader (Omaha, NE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Frenzy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View"], "date": ["February 3, 2021", "January 31, 2021", "December 4, 2020", "November 10, 2020", "July 17, 2020", "July 14, 2020", "July 3, 2020", "June 26, 2020", "April 7, 2020", "February 13, 2020", "February 13, 2020", "January 8, 2020", "December 2, 2019", "November 26, 2019", "August 29, 2019", "August 7, 2019", "July 30, 2019", "July 14, 2019", "April 18, 2019", "April 9, 2019"]}}
