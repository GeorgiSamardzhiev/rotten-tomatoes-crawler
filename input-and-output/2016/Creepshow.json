{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A compendium of five short but terrifying tales contained within a single full-length feature, this film conjures scares from traditional bogeymen and portents of doom. In one story, a monster escapes from its holding cell. Another focuses on a husband (Leslie Nielsen) with a creative way of getting back at his cheating wife. Other stories concern a rural man (Stephen King) and a visitor from outer space, and a homeowner (E.G. Marshall) with huge bug problems and a boozing corpse.", "rating": "73", "genre": "Horror", "runtime": "1h 57m", "director": "George A.

Romero with King was seen as a monumental summit; the movie that resulted from their collaboration is uneven, but its best bits hold up as well as anything in either master's canon.", "Creepshow feels incomplete. Its slapstick humor is not enough to hold the attention it could gain from using a betterly written script. [Full review in Spanish].", "A certain measure of generosity and goodwill is necessary to fully enjoy this endeavor from director George Romero, since the stories by Stephen King aren't anything special.", "The lighting, color palette, splashy FX work, and caricature acting all combine to make Creepshow one of horror's most distinct and enduring films.", "Creepshow is special not because it's an extended homage to EC Comics (though that doesn't hurt) but what stands out is the way these shorts are captured in style that reflects their inspiration, almost eerily so.", "As with any anthology film, some stories are better than others. Even so, there are no outright clunkers here, just five entertaining tales told with great style.", "It is so dumb and so, so fun.", "As fun as Creepshow is, the movie Romero and King crafted is also an act of revenge, as each has recounted in interviews how the EC titles the movie is paying tribute to were frowned upon by many in mainstream society.", "As much as I love and admire Romero's zombie pictures... I may love Creepshow just a little bit more.", "One of the rare horror anthologies with a sharp sense of storytelling and an intrinsic ability for irony and metaphor...", "Genuinely creepy, satirical and occasionally daft horror tales with a distinctly moral bent.", "George Romero, collaborating with writer Stephen King, again proves his adeptness at combining thrills with tongue-in-cheek humor.", "All of the pieces of Creepshow come together in a smorgasbord of ghastly images, welcome humor, and solid, old-fashioned storytelling.", "The segments are consistent in quality and the film is still effective and entertaining.", "This horror omnibus tickles the funny bone while stripping it of its flesh, so that hysterical laughter comes as fast as the frights and as thick as the blood.", "Unfortunately, it never quite gels.", "This five-part film, based on the format of 50s horror comics, marks one of the few times George Romero has directed someone else's script (it's by Stephen King), and the results are only mildly interesting by the standards of his Dead trilogy.", "he old Amicus movies used EC originals to better effect and with more brevity, for all their cardboard sets.", "A wickedly funny horror anthology.
