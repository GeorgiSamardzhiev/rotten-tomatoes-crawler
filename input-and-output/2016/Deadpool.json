{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) is a former Special Forces operative who now works as a mercenary. His world comes crashing down when evil scientist Ajax (Ed Skrein) tortures, disfigures and transforms him into Deadpool. The rogue experiment leaves Deadpool with accelerated healing powers and a twisted sense of humor. With help from mutant allies Colossus and Negasonic Teenage Warhead (Brianna Hildebrand), Deadpool uses his new skills to hunt down the man who nearly destroyed his life.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Tim Miller", "studio": "Donners&#39;Company,KinbergGenre", "theater_date": "Feb 12, 2016", "dvd_date": "Apr 21, 2016", "box_office": "$363.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's occasionally a little too rude and crude, bloody and bowed for it's own good but at least it tries to do something a little different in the well-worn context of the superhero genre.", "It's easy to make a superhero film nowadays. However, a film is nothing without great writers that understand the character and an actor that is passionate about it. Ryan Reynold IS Deadpool.", "Goes to great lengths to distance itself from the pack of recent Marvel entities, which have become more or less interchangeable.", "The film plays well over multiple viewings and holds comedy to a higher standard than mere action and wise cracks.", "A terrific directing debut from Tim Miller that pretty much awards him a throne made of golden jockstraps on the wings of Stan Lee.", "Witty, profane, and full of action, Deadpool is a nice breath of fresh air.", "\"Deadpool\" is the fast-paced (gory), action-packed (violent) and hilarious (incredibly off-color) comic book movie that we needed, but had no idea we did until it came along.", "It bets on violent action and the most twisted dark humor that's been seen in any Marvel movie, of course, with Ryan Reynolds' wild role as Deadpool. [Full review in Spanish]", "There is no middle ground with this movie, for the middle ground has been thoroughly set on fire. Those who dislike it will absolutely loathe it. Those who like it will fight a duel to defend its honor. I thoroughly enjoyed it...", "It's competently made, and mostly fun.", "Coupled with the action-packed fight scenes, Deadpool proves he is here to entertain and he spectacularly does so, thanks to Reynolds' quick-witted performance.", "From the moment the film begins and you see the words \"directed by an overpaid tool\" and \"produced by a-hats\" on screen, you know \"Deadpool\" isn't going to be like any other superhero movie you've seen before.", "It's all filthier, and more hilarious, exciting, and ultra-violent than you can probably imagine.", "This is the first R-rated Marvel film and it's smart, slick, sweet and sexy.", "Wiping away the bad taste X-Men Origins: Wolverine left us with, Deadpool easily overcomes its few minor flaws to deliver a satisfying, hilarious, and action-packed adventure.", "Reynolds totally brings the funny and from the opening credits this hectic, insane script delivered many moments of joy.", "If you know anything about Deadpool then you know Ryan Reynolds was born to portray him. The casting was incredible. The jokes and references were spot on and I couldn't have been more pleased with this film.", "Beneath the vulgar facade and low-budg sheen lies a very self-safe origin story skeleton, one that lives and breathes by the beats of that whence came before it.", "Deadpool has the potential to make previous Marvel superhero movies seem lumbering and ponderously humorless in comparison.", "Reynolds makes it work. Sneering superheroes are a new breed, but Reynolds' inherent charm and first-time director Tim Miller's light touch keep the ultra-gory film from veering into gratuitously snarky territory."], "rating": ["4/5", "", "7/10", "", "3.5/4", "B+", "", "7/10", "", "", "4/5", "A-", "A-", "", "4/5", "3.5/5", "", "B-", "4/5", "7/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Jordy Sirkin", "Mike Massie", "Dan Buffa", "Richard Propes", "Brent McKnight", "Damond Fudge", "Yasser Medina", "Tim Brennan", "Chris McCoy", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Kirsten Acuna", "Leslie Combemale", "Linda and Al Lerner", "Josh Wilding", "Kate Rodger", "Tessa Smith", "Matt Oakes", "Alexa Dalby", "Julie Crawford"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Jordy Reviews It", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KSDK News (St. Louis)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KCCI (Des Moines, IA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">About Boulder", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flick Feast", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Business Insider", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies and Shakers", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ComicBookMovie.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newshub (NZ)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Mama&#39;s Geeky", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Silver Screen Riot", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dog and Wolf", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">North Shore News (Vancouver, B.C.)"], "date": ["February 3, 2021", "January 2, 2021", "December 4, 2020", "November 10, 2020", "September 5, 2020", "July 3, 2020", "June 30, 2020", "June 26, 2020", "February 13, 2020", "January 13, 2020", "November 18, 2019", "October 27, 2019", "October 17, 2019", "October 16, 2019", "September 1, 2019", "August 23, 2019", "July 11, 2019", "June 5, 2019", "May 31, 2019", "April 17, 2019"]}}
