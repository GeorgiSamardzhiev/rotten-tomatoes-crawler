We're left with existential terror.", "A thrilling tale of survival, dehumanisation and coming-of-age in Nazi-occupied Europe.", "The technique is the jaggedly familiar one of cuts to fantasy and memories; the result painful but pitiful, with something new to say about the inhumanity, not of official fiends, but of everyday old men out on a spree.", "Not just specifically about the Second World War, Nemec's film still has resonance today as a broader allegory for the politics of power and the often belligerent attitude of the old towards the young.", "Nemec's debut stunner feels even more potent now that it's been freed of the expectations and delineations of a national movement.", "Haunting.", "One loses interest.
