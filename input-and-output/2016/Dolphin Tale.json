{"metadata": {"synopsis": "While swimming free in the ocean, a young dolphin gets caught in a trap and severely damages her tail. Though she is rescued and transported to Clearwater Marine Hospital, her tail cannot be saved, and the prognosis is dire. What the dolphin, now named Winter, needs is a miracle. She gets that miracle in the form of a marine biologist (Harry Connick Jr.), a prosthetics designer (Morgan Freeman), and a devoted boy (Nathan Gamble), who find a way to help Winter swim again.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Drama/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Charles Martin Smith", "studio": "AlconEntertainment", "theater_date": "Sep 23, 2011", "dvd_date": "Feb 15, 2014", "box_office": "$72.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Director Charles Martin Smith tugs a little too hard on the viewer's heartstrings, but Freeman's shrewd underplaying prevents the film from drowning in schmaltz.", "The real message of Dolphin Tale is that families aren't just families of birth but families of choice.", "A nice little outing for young nature enthusiasts, even if the performances are uniformly stilted. Except for the lead role, which, remarkably, is played by the real Winter herself!", "An inspirational, multi-layered film for everyone that has depth and meaning for all.", "Impeccable performances in small but powerful roles... [Full review in Spanish]", "There's just not enough here to justify paying for the full-price theater experience.", "Emotionally manipulative, this film will probably reduce you to tears but in a jolly, uplifting kind of way.", "It just wants to make you leave the theater in a good mood. It certainly accomplishes that.", "Dolphin Tale, an inspirational tale about a Little Dolphin Who Could, will swim into your heart despite some melodrama and predictability.", "Middle-of-the-road milquetoast.", "It's an earnest, sweet film that relies on the extraordinary true story of Winter, the rescued dolphin, and little on manipulative Hollywood tricks.", "When I write the \"Cookie Awards\" in my annual Oscar-season column for the Quad-City Times, I always include this category: Most Embarrassing Crying Spell. There is no question which movie will 'win' the award. I bawled when I watched 'Dolphin Tale.'", "In the hands of actor-turned-director Charles Martin Smith, this kid-centric drama provides a welcome family option with positive values and a minimum of frantic, noisy CGI. It's a tale told on a human (and animal) scale.", "One wonders why the filmmakers felt the need to turn a fascinating true story into a cliche-ridden, formulaic family film.", "While some adults may get impatient with it, kids will undoubtedly find it appealing.", "Inspired by a wonderfully inspiring true story, Dolphin Tale has all the right ingredients for a family movie with adorable dolphins ..and the plucky youngster who plays a major role in the feel-good plot", "You would have to have a heart of stone not to be moved by this uplifting, heart-warming tale, about a dolphin that learns to swim with a prosthetic tail", "Sawyer's interactions with Winter make the movie fun for kids especially - an intelligent animal connects with a boy in need of attention and affection.", "Those looking to leave the cinema with a warm glow should seek this one out.", "Sometimes drifts into the emotional shallows rather than letting its 'inspired by a true story' soar on its own."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "3/5", "3.5/4", "3/5", "", "3/5", "B-", "7/10", "2/4", "4/5", "3.5/4", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "6/10", "", "", "", "3/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Jason Best", "Richard Propes", "Leigh Paatsch", "Sarah Knight Adamson", "Laura Hiros", "Josh Terry", "Francesca Rudkin", "Will Leitch", "Amy Curtis", "Michael Dequina", "Rebecca Barry Hill", "Linda Cook", "Peter Canavese", "Mike McGranaghan", "John J.
