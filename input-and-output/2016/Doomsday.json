Twenty-five years later, Maj. Eden Sinclair (Rhona Mitra) leads a team back into the hot zone to find a counteragent to the virus, which has re-emerged in London. She and her comrades wage a desperate battle for survival against feral survivors, as they try to prevent it from ushering in a new dark age.", "rating": "51", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Horror/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Neil Marshall", "studio": "CrystalSky", "theater_date": "Mar 14, 2008", "dvd_date": "Jun 15, 2012", "box_office": "$11.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The look of the picture is atmospheric and perfectly terrifying, but the eventual clashes and tragedies involve generic soldiers barely worthy of individual names.", "Marshall's pilfering is brazen... but his movie is such an exhilarating, hell-for-leather ride that by the time you spot borrowings from Excalibur and Gladiator you'll probably applaud him for his cheek.", "Marshall sabotages himself here with a script that tries to accomplish far too much.", "It's a jumbled mishmash of genres and tones. It doesn't always work, but when it does it REALLY does.", "[It] may not have anything new to bring to the gallows, but what it does have is Marshall's deadly serious tone (one suspects Marshall could direct Robin Williams and Christopher Walken in Waiting for Godot and come out of it with his genre cred intact)", "Filmmaker Neil Marshall delivers a blisteringly-paced opening stretch that effectively establishes the movie's dystopian landscape and the rough-and-tumble protagonists...", "Doomsday does for the 1980s-style post-apocalypticism of Road Warrior what Grease did for the 1950s. It turns it into a kiddie musical. The difference is that people liked Grease.", "...a Whitman's sampler of bizarre story ideas and visual gimmicks, congealing around a premise that is so straightforward that it affords them no groundwork for stability or realization.", "", "I somehow ended up admiring \"Doomsday\" for being the most unapologetically ridiculously, preposterous action movie I've ever seen.", "Marshall's adrenalin-fuelled skill and enthusiasm propel the action forward with reckless abandon.", "In terms of sheer excitement, it's the best movie of 2008.", "As it slogs through one hectic yet mundane set pieces after another, the film slowly drowns in its own pool of clichs.", "One's enjoyment of Doomsday might stem from how much one admires a blatant homage to the 1980s.", "Doomsday might seem novel - if you've never seen \"The Road Warrior,\" \"Aliens,\" \"Escape from New York\" or any other post-apocalyptic flick before.", "A bit like a medley of greatest hits performed by a hot, young talent who brings a new vocal inflection to the tired, old standards.", "Doomsday possde dfinitivement toutes les caractristiques d'un film culte en devenir, mme si celles-ci nous laissent toujours en tte une curieuse impression de dj vu.", "A tribute to the early 1980s anarchy actioners The Road Warrior and Escape From New York, Neil Marshall's Doomsday also blends elements from 28 Days Later for a fun and ultra-violent action-sci-fi-kinda-horror film.", "Get your Mad Max mutant-maniacs-in-monster-machines on.", "The movie doesn't disguise the fact that this is a loving homage to early 80's science fiction cult classics."], "rating": ["3/10", "", "2.0/4", "", "2.5/5", "3/4", "", "1.5/4", "3/5", "7/10", "4/5", "5/5", "C+", "2.5/4", "2/4", "", "6/10", "3/4", "3.0/4", "3/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Jason Best", "Richard Propes", "Trace Thurman", "Marc Savlov", "David Nusair", "A.S.
