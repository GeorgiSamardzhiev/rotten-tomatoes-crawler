There are times when it is brisk and lively, even rather amusing; other times when you just cringe at how syrupy and overdone it is.", "While it does have its charm, and it does, it's a pretty bad, pretty hokey piece of fluff that never really registers as a genuine drama, only as an emotionally manipulative piece of dribble with actors that give horrible accents.", "A sprightly pace and a fatalistic sense of humor propel the proceedings over a generous amount of drinking jokes and other cliches of Irish life and culture.", "Did director Bruce Beresford have to ratchet up the saccharine of an innately sentimental story?", "It offers few surprises, but the strength of the performances, and Beresford's touch as a director make it a worthwhile diversion.", "", "Instead of the clear-headed resolve the material demands, Beresford's film offers slush, blarney and grandstanding actors ...", "Evelyn works as a modest parable, the truth shining through in spite of the filmmakers' unfortunate oversimplifications.", "Old fashioned spirit and resolve work well in a movie like 'Evelyn.'", "Modest in almost every respect, yet deeply satisfying.", "", "", "...too schmaltzy to take seriously.", "After The Tailor of Panama made it clear that Brosnan can slide into character-based comedy with ease, Evelyn proves that his more challenging, dramatic work is in desperate need of being vigorously shaken and stirred.", "Here's a sweet film to rent for Father's Day or Christmas.
