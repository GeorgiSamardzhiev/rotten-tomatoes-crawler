Austin) comes to a turning point in his life when he faces a critical decision: Should he take a chance and possibly become a hero, or should he play it safe?

This movie is so stupid. If I were four, I'd much rather just watch Baby Einstein on a continuous loop. At least it looks pretty.", "I left the theatre wishing I could return to the days when I was a lot more like Yankee Irving than I'd care to admit.", "The movie is a feast of miscalculations.", "... a modestly engaging mix of broad comedy and nostalgic fable, spiked with a few unwelcome sprinklings of gross-out gags."], "rating": ["3/5", "C+", "D", "B-", "1.5/5", "2/5", "2/4", "1/5", "C+", "2.5/4", "D", "C", "C", "1/5", "3/4", "", "", "3.5/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jane Boursaw", "Christopher Smith", "Scott Mendelson", "Steven D.
