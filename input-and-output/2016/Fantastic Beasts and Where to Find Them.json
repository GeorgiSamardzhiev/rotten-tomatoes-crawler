{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The year is 1926, and Newt Scamander (Eddie Redmayne) has just completed a global excursion to find and document an extraordinary array of magical creatures. Arriving in New York for a brief stopover, he might have come and gone without incident, were it not for a No-Maj (American for Muggle) named Jacob, a misplaced magical case, and the escape of some of Newt's fantastic beasts, which could spell trouble for both the wizarding and No-Maj worlds.", "rating": "74", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 7m", "director": "David Yates", "studio": "HeydayFilms,Nvizible,WarnerBros.Pictures", "theater_date": "Nov 18, 2016", "dvd_date": "Mar 8, 2017", "box_office": "$234.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["With its message that magic is all around us if we know where to look, the movie is a handsome, entertaining and ultimately sequel worthy piece of work.", "There are a few interesting ideas at play, but they're typically neglected for some interruptive commotion.", "Rowling knows how to play into the comedy and injects the film with a playful sense of humor...", "Delivers the kind of blockbuster fun and energy that was sorely lacking during the summer months this year.", "The film may seem well known for the references in the Harry Potter saga, but the story's own identity tells us that we are in a renewed territory that, as we already anticipated, has bewitched us with an amazing spectacle. [Full review in Spanish]", "I thought it was pretty boring.", "It was a horrible, awful misstep.", "Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them is a genuinely interesting, sometimes thrilling new world that still feels vaguely familiar.", "If it is a fantasy story that includes historical elements but isn't strict about accuracy then there is no reason for the casting to not reflect the diversity of modern audiences...", "All of the action around Newt's missing beasts is enjoyable, and many of the creatures (more Nifflers, please) are irresistible.", "While Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them isn't all the way a good movie, it has promise.", "Redmayne is a compelling central presence, and the story is head-and-shoulders above anything else in the blockbuster world this year. But... it suffers sorely from the missing chemistry at its core.", "The film is lush and Rowling-esque enough - with plenty of wonderfully animated fantastic beasties - to satisfy Potter fans.", "Is it a blatant cash grab from Warner Brothers or a creative return to an expansive world we all knew J.K. Rowling couldn't abandon entirely? Of course it's both.", "A refreshing addition to the Potterverse, it serves as an appropriate foundation for its forthcoming sequels that will hopefully open up more opportunities for the ever-expanding franchise.", "Everything is built to draw you in, enthrall, and connect you to the action.", "A bloated hodgepodge of tangential creature-related asides distract from a tedious ho-hum narrative.", "An immensely entertaining film.", "With Yates at the helm, fans should expect an assured, polished and cohesive watch which fuses the old and the new, the magic with reality, and the spectacle with heart.", "I want to be up front with Harry Potter fans - this movie is not Potter caliber.
