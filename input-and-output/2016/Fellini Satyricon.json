{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After his young lover, Gitone (Max Born), leaves him for another man, Encolpio (Martin Potter) decides to kill himself, but a sudden earthquake destroys his home before he has a chance to do so. Now wandering around Rome in the time of Nero, Encolpio encounters one bizarre and surreal scene after another. He's invited to a poetry reading that ends in violence; is taken hostage by pirates; and is even forced to battle a gladiator disguised as a minotaur in a giant labyrinth.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Art House & International/Comedy/Cult Movies/Drama/Horror/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Romance", "runtime": "2h 8m", "director": "Federico Fellini", "studio": "UnitedArtists", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 10, 2001", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It must be said that, though Fellini Satyricon is unarguably astounding in its visual depiction and its audacious narrative form, I find it personally a bit impenetrable. That said, it could be argued that that is indeed the point.", "For the adventurous, open-minded moviegoer observing a Fellini film at some point in life is nearly a must.", "Unfortunately, the film is only a decoration, a design, so reliant on visual style that the result is very nearly a parody of the fluid camera and cinematic virtuosity of [Fellini's] earlier films.", "Satyricon achieves a curious dual effect. It walks all over the audience with its gross, greasy detail, and at the same time it is deliberately uninvolved and uninvolving.", "Stunning camerawork in deliberately garish colour from Giuseppe Rotunna, incomparable art direction, and some riveting music from Nini Rota aid Fellini in his principal task, which is simply to astonish and to widen the imagination.", "Satyricon is an expressionist film. Less in the sense of historical expressionism than in that of a representation where subjectivity pushed to the borders of the unconscious signally prevails over objectivity.", "Apart from all the debatable elements of [Federico Fellin\u00ed's] style, Satiric\u00f3n is a totally recommendable movie. [Full review in Spanish]", "There's a numbness to the entire cumulative experience. That's where its true effect lies, and Fellini Satyricon is mostly a reminder of how wide open and full of possibility this particular time in cinema was.", "It's, by design, an overwhelming film, and sometimes an exhausting one, but the melancholy and wariness keep it grounded.", "True, the various strands are never bound together, but with material this sumptuous it really doesn't matter.", "Federico Fellini presents an incredible fresco-like vision of Rome's social structure 2,000 years ago in which survival and pleasure were man's sole motivating forces.", "A shallow, hypocritical film, without a glimmer of genuine creativity.", "The odd thing is that the excess seems visual and mythical rather than really sexual.", "Fellini's characteristic delirium is in fact anchored in a precise, psychological schema: under the matrix of bisexuality, he explores the complexes of castration, impotence, paranoia and libidinal release.", "", "Those who don't weaken and bolt for the door experience a one-of-a-kind visual adventure they are unlikely to forget.", "Fellini received a well deserved Oscar nomination for this bizarre, wildly flamboyant but plotless spectacle, inspired by the firt century author Petronius, flaunting glorious production values.", "", "Hedonistic buffet", ""], "rating": ["3/5", "4.0/4", "", "", "", "", "", "2.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "", "4/4", "", "4/5", "", "B+", "4/5", "3/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Jordan M.
