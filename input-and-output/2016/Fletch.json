{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A veritable chameleon, investigative reporter Irwin \"Fletch\" Fletcher (Chevy Chase) might drive his editor (Richard Libertini) up the wall, but he always produces great pieces for the newspaper. When his next story is about the drug trade taking place on the beach, Fletch goes undercover as a homeless man. Unaware of Fletch's true identity, businessman Alan Stanwyk (Tim Matheson) offers Fletch $50,000 to kill him. Intrigued, Fletch decides to unearth the full story behind the offer.", "rating": "77", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Michael Ritchie", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 15, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["As Chevy Chase's best starring vehicle, it inverts the novels' occasional darkness into a quick-witted quip machine.

At its core, the film is a top notch mystery thriller.", "", "A breezy, peppy frolic and a tour de force for Chase.", "Fast-paced and witty, this is Chase's best solo venture to date, and will hold almost anyone's attention for its well-edited 98 minutes.", "Michael Ritchie's 1985 mystery comedy has the pleasant, modest feel of a Fox B picture from the 30s.", "", "Twenty-two years later, I get all the jokes, but I remain only pleasantly amused, nothing more, nothing less", "A quick, smart, slick piece of comedy filmmaking that features a once-great comedian at the very top of his game.", "This could be Bob Hope material c1942 and Chase does acquit himself well (though with cool reserve) in the gags-to-plot transitions.
