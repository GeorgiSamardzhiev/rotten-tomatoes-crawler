{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the waning days of Prohibition, Sugar Ray (Richard Pryor) and his adopted son, Quick (Eddie Murphy), run a speakeasy called Club Sugar Ray. When gangster Bugsy Calhoune (Michael Lerner) learns that Sugar Ray's place is pulling in more money than his own establishment, the Pitty Pat Club, he pays corrupt cop Phil Cantone (Danny Aiello) to close Club Sugar Ray down. Quick doesn't exactly help the situation when he falls for Calhoune's gun moll, Miss Dominique La Rue (Jasmine Guy).", "rating": "21", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 58m", "director": "Eddie Murphy", "studio": "EddieMurphyProductions,ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$58.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Scoring high marks alternatively for repellent dialogue, staging and characterizations as well as deadly boredom, Harlem Nights may well be the worst major movie of 1989.", "''Harlem Nights,'' it's worth remembering, is a comedy, though as the body count piles up and entire reels go by without a joke in sight, it's also easy to forget.", "\"Harlem Nights\" is billed as an action-comedy, but it doesn't blend the two very smoothly.", "If he's going to confine himself to bad movies like \"Harlem Nights,\" it's probably better that he writes and directs them himself.", "Harlem Nights offers a depressing answer to that not entirely pressing question, \"Will success spoil Eddie Murphy?\" It looks as if it has.", "What this film suffers from is lack of fun.", "The plot exposition gets laborious in spots, the period flavor is only occasional and approximate, and the direction tends to be clunky, yet the strong secondary cast helps to take up some of the slack.", "The plan was to make a latter-day version of a 1930s gangster movie; the result has some nifty costumes, luscious sets and neat music, but, on almost every other count, it's a mess.", "Unfortunately, a real comedy needs a decent plot, interesting characters and some kind of creative context to work out of.", "If only it had played funnier.", "The plot is a standard recycling of rival gangs battling for turf, and the stunner is why Murphy found any interest in his own script.", "In the end, there's no soul to be had in this city of appearances.", "The story, spread thin over two hours, owed something to better films but is entirely devoid of charm, wit, acting skill or excitement.", "Murphy wrote and directed this period piece which doesn't hold back on the strong language and profanity... but to humorous effect.", "Despite a flimsy script and a vain director, some of the supporting cast give spirited performances.", "Murphy's writing is about as snappy as a Sunday school lesson. The constant obscenities become a distraction and an eventual turnoff, and seem to be used when the writer and director can't invent something more creative.", "The movie is a whirlingly divergent romp, blending serious violence with outrageous comedy, but it has the feel of oral history, of lives and times rescued from oblivion.", "This blatantly excessive directorial debut for Eddie Murphy is overdone, too rarely funny and, worst of all, boring.", "Harlem Nights is a bloated period piece, brandishing big production values, one or two good performances (notably Pryor and Aiello), the occasional laugh, and a spectacularly duff sub-Sting storyline that doesn't so much climax as go prematurely limp.", ""], "rating": ["", "1/4", "2/5", "", "", "", "", "2/5", "1/5", "", "1/4", "2/5", "4/10", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Candice Russell", "Dave Kehr", "Dennis King", "Michael Wilmington", "Richard Schickel", "Ralph Novak", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Peter Freedman", "William Thomas", "Jay Boyar", "Gene Siskel", "TV Guide Staff", "Film4 Staff", "Sky Staff", "Brian D.
