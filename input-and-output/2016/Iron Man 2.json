{"metadata": {"synopsis": "With the world now aware that he is Iron Man, billionaire inventor Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) faces pressure from all sides to share his technology with the military. He is reluctant to divulge the secrets of his armored suit, fearing the information will fall into the wrong hands. With Pepper Potts (Gwyneth Paltrow) and \"Rhodey\" Rhodes (Don Cheadle) by his side, Tony must forge new alliances and confront a powerful new enemy.", "rating": "72", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 4m", "director": "Jon Favreau", "studio": "MarvelStudios", "theater_date": "May 7, 2010", "dvd_date": "Nov 23, 2015", "box_office": "$312.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Much of the magic that made the original film entertaining is left by the wayside in favor of bigger bangs and larger quantities of machine-gun-toting robots.", "There's almost no denying that Terrence Howard replacement Don Cheadle, as Rhodey, exhibits a better chemistry with Downey.", "They definitely make Tony too unlikable in this film", "Comic book blabber that does not gain value for the franchise. [Full review in Spanish].", "The visual effects are memorable especially the Monaco Grad Prix scene. Just the right amount, but not over-bearing.", "Like Iron Man before it, the film's military funding doesn't just result in a wrongheaded political outlook, but in a confused character-story.", "In the end, Iron Man 2 is what it is... a sequel that, although not quite living up to the original, manages to hold its own and, above all, a fun popcorn movie that will put a smile on your face.", "The sequel suffers from the \"where-do-we-go-to-now\" conundrum.", "Watching [Robert Downey Jr.] is like being invited over and over to his highly entertaining, extravagant party.", "There's some nice character work here. And under the direction of Jon Favreau, who also has a minor role as Stark's thuggish driver, Happy Hogan, the script is loaded with witty dialogue. But the action is as dumb as the dialogue is smart.", "A big-time superhero spectacle that delivers to both fans and newcomers alike.", "It's a little messy and not nearly up to par with the original, but this is still an acceptable sequel with just enough fun to appease its fan base.", "Iron Man 2 would be surpassed by some other offerings in the MCU, notably the first two Captain America movies, but it remains one of the smartest and least silly chapters in the 22-film extravaganza.", "Iron Man 2 is still a good film but I'm saddened to report that it is not the rare sequel that becomes greater than its predecessor.", "Iron Man 2 doesn't take itself seriously; it's a nonstop joyride starring a wisecracked eccentric atypical superhero, and it deftly delivers.", "While I didn't hate it, Iron Man 2 just isn't as memorable and as begging of a rewatch as many other Marvel movies.", "An impressive spectacle that will surely please both unacquainted viewer and the die-hard Marvel fan alike.", "Like the red-and-gold icon at its center, Iron Man 2 is smooth, stylish, and whizzes and whirs along with machine-like efficiency, occasionally displaying just enough spontaneity to lend the proceedings some humanity.", "Personally, I enjoyed it...it's a traditional storyline, but as far as I can tell, it still works for a reason.", "If there were any new ideas, I failed to spot them, as did my bone marrow, which slept through most of it anyhow."], "rating": ["5/10", "2.5/4", "", "1/4", "4/4", "", "3.5/5", "2.5/5", "", "", "3/4", "B", "", "4/5", "", "6.2", "3/5", "B+", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Rachel Wagner", "Federico Furzan", "Sarah Knight Adamson", "Siddhant Adlakha", "Nikki Baughan", "Kate Rodger", "Leslie Combemale", "Brian D.
