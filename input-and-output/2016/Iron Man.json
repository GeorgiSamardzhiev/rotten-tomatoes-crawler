But hey, it could've been worse.", "Downey's performance is larger and more animated than the action and special effects; he's the heart beneath Iron Man's titanium plating and the best reason to see the film."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "", "B+", "8/10", "5/5", "8.2", "", "A", "", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "A", "A-", "", "", "", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Siddhant Adlakha", "Micheal Compton", "Kaitlyn Booth", "Danielle Solzman", "Colby Bryant", "Eileen Jones", "Zaki Hasan", "Karl French", "Leona Laurie", "Marcianne Miller", "Deborah Ross", "Sean Axmaker", "Mike Scott", "Clint O&#39;Connor", "Craig Outhier", "Brian D.
