[Full Review in Spanish]", "The film fails at every level.", "It is a smart, generous, genuinely funny affair. Sometimes, like the camel who almost ambles away with the picture, it's longish in the tooth, but it is based on an extremely astute vision of life.", "There are three or four memorable sequences in Ishtar -- the purchase of the blind camel, the use of fake Arabic in an auction scene, and the first horrendous singing performance of stupid songs. But the film lacks pace and consistent tone.", "Reasonably genial and diverting.", "Ishtar is cute, reasonably pleasant entertainment, but no motion picture oasis for Hoffman, Beatty or their fans.", "Ishtar is a good movie, but you can't help but wonder if, lurking somewhere in those cans of outtakes, there isn't a great movie, too.", "This Elaine May comedy was the most underappreciated commercial movie of 1987. It isn't quite as good as May's previous features, but it's still a very funny work by one of this country's greatest comic talents.", "Beatty goes along with the casting joke of playing the nerd sidekick to Hoffman's slick loverboy. But zany antics aren't his forte. Hoffman's impishness serves the film better until the sheer weight of the production grinds him down", "Though far from a masterpiece, the movie is often hilarious in a sly, seemingly improvisational way.", "One of the grossest miscalculations of the blockbuster era.", "An incredible box office loser and, to be frank, far from great, Ishtar is still not nearly as awful as many would have it.", "So is the film merely a misunderstood messenger from God, or is it really just a barren desert of blind camel jokes?", "It's a film that resists categorization, staking a claim on a weird, absurdist territory of its own. For that, in the maddeningly generic landscape of '80s multiplexes, it was crucified. Now it's celebrated. And rightfully so.", "This big, overblown comedy starring Dustin Hoffman and Warren Beatty is thoroughly likable despite all the hype.", "..an undeniably messy movie that you nonetheless want to treasure just for its oddball existence.", "Maybe [it's] actually okay; maybe parts of it [are] even great.", "The performances are endearing enough, the pacing is actually quite crisp and there is no shortage of zany silliness in the story. It just never gels.", "The 1980s saw the release of so many truly atrocious films (Xanadu, Stroker Ace, Bolero, Shanghai Surprise, etc.) that it's absurd \"Ishtar\" became shorthand for the worst of the worst and continues to be blasted by folks who haven't even seen it.", "Besides droll supporting work from an excellent Charles Grodin, Ishtar also gets a lot of mileage out of its terrible and terribly funny songs."], "rating": ["", "0.5/4", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "1/5", "2/5", "2/5", "", "", "3/4", "7/10", "5", "2.5/4", "3/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["\u00c1ngel Luis Inurria", "Gene Siskel", "Sheila Benson", "Jack Garner", "Richard Schickel", "Roger Hurlburt", "Dave Kehr", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "People Staff", "Jay Boyar", "David Parkinson", "TV Guide Staff", "Daniel Barnes", "Jason Bailey", "Cathy Burke", "Josh Larsen", "Tim Brayton", "Dan Jardine", "Matt Brunson", "Eric Melin"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gannett News Service", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dare Daniel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flavorwire", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">United Press International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemania", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Scene-Stealers.com"], "date": ["June 16, 2020", "March 19, 2019", "March 19, 2019", "March 19, 2019", "March 19, 2019", "March 19, 2019", "March 19, 2019", "March 19, 2019", "March 19, 2019", "March 19, 2019", "March 19, 2019", "March 19, 2019", "February 26, 2019", "June 8, 2017", "November 8, 2016", "April 4, 2016", "October 25, 2014", "March 17, 2014", "August 24, 2013", "August 9, 2013"]}}
