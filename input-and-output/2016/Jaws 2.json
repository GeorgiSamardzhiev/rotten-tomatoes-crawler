{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Years after the shark attacks that left Amity Island reeling, Sheriff Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) finds new trouble lurking in the waters. Mayor Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) wants to rid the beach town of the stain on its reputation. But the disappearance of a pair of divers suggests that all is not right. When Sheriff Brody voices his warnings about holding a sailing competition, everyone thinks it's post-traumatic stress. That is, until a shark fin cuts through the water.", "rating": "58", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 57m", "director": "Jeannot Szwarc", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 12, 2014", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["By telling the same story again (and with a weighty two-hour running time), it merely reinforces the notion that Spielberg's vision was comprehensive and complete.", "Jaws 2 manages to entertain and scare.

[Full Review in Spanish]", "Doesn't have Spielberg's storytelling elegance or sense of pacing, but by pretty much any measure Jaws 2 is a solid adventure yarn", "There was reason to believe that \"Jaws 2\" would be a mess. It isn't. It's better than most sequels. It's formula-ridden but slick, and the special effects work as intended.", "Far from a classic, but a very worthy follow-up.", "Stalwart Scheider is in full control of this blas\u00e9 follow-up that makes one wonder why mayor Murray Hamilton hasn't learnt any lessons from previous events.", "I am also a fan of slasher movies, so I like that the film almost seems like a Jaws-ified response to the slasher boom, as the film's second half revolves around a group of trapped teens being menaced by the shark.", "While it lacks the originality, wit and character interplay that gave \"Jaws\" an exceptionally appealing impact, \"Jaws 2\" is proficient enough to avoid bombing out.", "It never comes close to the classic status of its predecessor, but for drive-in horror thrills, this still has sufficient bite.", "Unnecessary sequel has less plot, more peril and violence.", "The surprise in Jaws 2 is that, given the givens, it came out as well as it did. For me, in terms of sheer visceral zapping, it's better than the first time around (or under).", "Nowhere near as good as the first, and lacks the traces of true stupidity that make the latter two fun bad movies.", "Rather redundant, rather biting. What, fish again?! Still, not a bad sequel.", "", "Suspension of disbelief might have been possible had this been a ripping good yarn; but the kids are just plain silly, and it's a toss-up to decide which is more unconvincing, the shark or Scheider.", "Roy Scheider is the only redeeming quality of this sequel.", "A vastly underrated sequel with plenty of shocks and nail-biting tension.
