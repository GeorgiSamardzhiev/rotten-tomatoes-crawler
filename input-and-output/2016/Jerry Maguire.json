{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When slick sports agent Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) has a crisis of conscience, he pens a heartfelt company-wide memo that promptly gets him fired. Desperate to hang on to the athletes that he represents, Jerry starts his own management firm, with only single mother Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger) joining him in his new venture. Banking on their sole client, football player Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.), Jerry and Dorothy begin to fall in love as they struggle to make their business work.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 18m", "director": "Cameron Crowe", "studio": "TriStarPictures", "theater_date": "Dec 11, 1996", "dvd_date": "Nov 1, 2012", "box_office": "$153.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The dialogue is superb, bringing these relatable characters and their grounded situations an extraordinary sense of authenticity and hilarity.", "Jerry Maguire offers the best of both worlds: romance and sports.", "It's an easy charmer that manages to avoid the paint-by-numbers traps most romantic comedies fall into. Cruise should make more movies like this and Cameron Crowe should make more movies, period.", "On the jock front, Gooding is so believable in his role as Jerry's selfish, pea-brained, wide receiver client that the Dallas Cowboys might consider signing him to complement Michael Irvin.", "Cruise brilliantly portrays a man on the brink of losing his marbles and his grip on reality as he knows it: he's hilarious, sad and desperate but still seems charming in this 1996 movie.", "Zellweger's rumpled, anti-star quality plays in perfect contrast to Preston's buff and polish. She redeems Jerry Maguire and Tom Cruise, too by making him human again.", "I like Crowe's movies; I mostly enjoyed this one.", "This comedy has everything going for it, not least of which is Cruise's most appealing performance since Risky Business.", "Cruise's relationship with Zellweger's character is fascinating, far deeper and more honest than the usual cookie-cutter romance.", "It's Cameron Crowe's finest hour.", "The halting romance between Maguire and Dorothy -- he fearing intimacy, she admiring his budding humanity -- is one of the film's surpassing pleasures. The excellent supporting cast is another.", "Cruise is very good in small moments with Dorothy's son, played charmingly by Jonathan Lipnicki, but in some of the bigger scenes his performance is so wrong-headed you can't imagine what he was thinking.", "Cruise gives perhaps his most appealing performance ever in what is arguably his best movie.", "Unlike Mission Impossible, Jerry Maguire gives Cruise something to work with... He takes to it with zest.", "It's hard to believe that this frantic, self-congratulatory affair was written and directed by Mr. Crowe, the man who did Say Anything and Singles, two films notable for their modesty and tact.", "We've been down this path of self-discovery with Cruise before, but Crowe's movie is a lot less predictable than you'd expect.", "[It] may be referred to as \"the Tom Cruise sports agent movie,\" but really is an exciting romance and cautionary yuppie tale. And the actor who steals the movie is a name you have never heard of -- Renee Zellweger.", "Some amusing stuff about sports agentry drowns in the emotional shallows of Jerry Maguire.", "Brashly engaging.", "Cameron Crowe's romantic comedy is well acted by Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. (in an Oscar-winning turn), but as a tale of redemption, the movie is not too deep and goes out of its way to satisfy viewers' expectations of a happy ending."], "rating": ["1", "5/5", "B", "", "A", "3.5/4", "3/4", "", "", "5/5", "3/4", "", "5/5", "3/4", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "A-", "B+"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Danielle Solzman", "Wallace Baine", "Duane Byrge", "Candice Frederick", "Dave Kehr", "Michael Wilmington", "Tom Gliatto", "Matt Soergel", "Stephen Carty", "Dennis King", "Paul Tatara", "Jay Boyar", "Desmond Ryan", "Joe Morgenstern", "David Ansen", "Gene Siskel", "Michael Sragow", "Owen Gleiberman", "Emanuel Levy"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Solzy at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Santa Cruz Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Talk Online", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Florida Times-Union", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Eye for Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNN.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com"], "date": ["September 14, 2020", "August 6, 2020", "February 22, 2019", "December 18, 2018", "September 12, 2017", "August 24, 2016", "August 24, 2016", "August 24, 2016", "August 24, 2016", "August 24, 2016", "August 24, 2016", "August 24, 2016", "August 24, 2016", "August 24, 2016", "August 24, 2016", "August 24, 2016", "August 24, 2016", "August 24, 2016", "September 7, 2011", "December 15, 2010"]}}
