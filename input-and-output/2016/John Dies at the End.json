If what you want is schlocky fun, then John Dies at the End should deliver. If you want something more, then you may want to look elsewhere afterwards.", "This is a film for the young and the young at heart. And those who like their philosophy laden with a heavy dose of paranoia and oddity.", "This is a great jumping-off point if you've never been exposed to Don Coscarelli, one of the less-seen indie horror filmmakers out there. If \"JDATE\" serves as the gateway for new fans, then the movie will be twice the success it already is.", "Jump in, leave you sense of logic at the door, sit back and enjoy the trip.", "Rare is the flick that wedges this many genres into one frame, and so well.", "This is a gloriously gonzo trip packed with enough odd narrative tangents to fill half a dozen features. While not always successful, this energetic mash-up so genuinely wants to entertain that it's hard not to be won over by its barrage of absurdity.", "The saving grace of John Dies at the End is undoubtedly its manic storytelling: the energy and pacing of scenes give the movie the impression of being told on the spot (which is of course what the framing device intends).", "stands up to repeat viewings, and offers new insights each and every time", "It is refreshing that Coscarelli is willing to offer viewers something that at least tries to take the rules of cinema into new directions.", "Gonzo freakiness in such doses that cult status is practically ensured.", "I stopped taking notes when the woman disintegrated into a ball of writhing snakes.", "Despite its astronomical body count, John Dies at the End never takes itself too seriously, and neither should you.", "Something so weird and off the beaten track that it's kind of wonderful.", "I'm not saying this film will make more sense if you're high. But it will make more sense if you're high.", "Director Don Coscarelli isn't especially smooth or coherent, and he leans on weird for weird's sake.", "It's like a series of blackout sketches, some of which are entertaining. But mostly, it's a mess.", "When is a phone call from your dead friend more than just bizarre? When it's made on a hot dog. It's a hopeless mess.
