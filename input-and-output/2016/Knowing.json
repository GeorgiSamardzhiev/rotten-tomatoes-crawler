{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Fifty years after it was buried in a time capsule, a schoolgirl's cryptic document falls into the hands of Caleb Koestler, the son of professor John Koestler (Nicolas Cage). John figures out that the encoded message accurately lists every major disaster from the past five decades, and predicts three future calamities -- one a global cataclysm. When his warnings fall on deaf ears, John enlists the help of the prophetic author's daughter and granddaughter to try to avert the ultimate disaster.", "rating": "34", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Alex Proyas", "studio": "SummitEntertainment,EscapeArtists", "theater_date": "Mar 20, 2009", "dvd_date": "Aug 31, 2016", "box_office": "$79.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The plot is hinged around a predicament so overwhelming that its conclusion can't possibly resolve satisfactorily.", "Nicolas Cage being Nicolas Cage in a film that requires Cage to be Cage.", "Part science fiction clich\u00e9, part religious crackpotism, [the ending's] genuinely bad enough to cast a shadow over the entire film.", "Unbreakable quickly descends into bad CGI set-ups and portentous, hysterical exchanges.", "... I was dozing off...", "The impressively grim finale ensures that Knowing ultimately ends on a decidedly memorable note...", "A damned entertaining movie despite the fact that it stars Nicholas Cage.", "A shotgun spray of metaphysics, cosmology, the Old Testament, flying saucers, angels, spooky blonde-haired men in black trench coats, mysterious little black rocks, two cute kids and a moose on fire.", "Suffice it to say that the last third is a m\u00e9lange of Close Encounters and Christian eschatology, and you'll wish the film had stopped about 15 minutes sooner.", "If those space-dudes are so friendly, why drive children insane with a bunch of weird code?
