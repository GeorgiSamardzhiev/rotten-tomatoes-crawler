Now on the run, Kubo joins forces with Monkey (Charlize Theron) and Beetle (Matthew McConaughey) to unlock a secret legacy. Armed with a magical instrument, Kubo must battle the Moon King (Ralph Fiennes) and other gods and monsters to save his family and solve the mystery of his fallen father, the greatest samurai warrior the world has ever known.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Animation/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Travis Knight", "studio": "Laika,FocusFeatures", "theater_date": "Aug 19, 2016", "dvd_date": "Nov 8, 2016", "box_office": "$48.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A vivid trek of continual wonderment and excitement.", "I've seen quite a few animated films this year, and Kubo and the Two Strings ranks as the very best of that list.", "There's some lessons in there that were nice.", "The plot was different; it was interesting.", "As I said before, the craft alone is enough to warrant my adoration and money, I just want to see it applied to something that puts my heart on the same elevated plane as it puts my eyes.", "A plucky little studio, both geographically and spiritually removed from the Hollywood sausage factory, has beat the majors at their own game, and they've done it for a fraction of the cost.", "Kubo is a masterful, artistic view of Japanese folklore, which is so rich in storytelling and tradition.", "The animators use gorgeous, bold colors to paint vivid landscapes and portraits throughout the journey with painstaking detail that is marvelous.", "Kubo and the Two Strings is nothing if not beautiful. Its message may be equal parts repetitive and derivative, but the splendor on display is yet another reason we're lucky Laika studios continues to do this work.", "...keep in mind that there is some real violence, swordfighting, wounds that bleed, and real, permanent loss. This is a film that sets out to confront death and change, and it doesn't blink.", "It really is a masterpiece.", "KUBO AND THE TWO STRINGS stands as a great piece of art and a refreshing breeze in the late summer, ushering in the promise of better films to come through a heartening journey brimming with mystery, culture and terror.", "Beyond its rich thematic subtext (which is, I admit, occasionally a bit heavy-handed), Kubo and the Two Strings borrows familiar motifs to create an entirely new mythology - one that's worthy of the word epic.", "Kubo and the Two Strings avoids the generic Disney idea of good and evil by showing some empathy and compassion for the main villain--this is extremely rare.", "The mixture of humor, thrills, drama and tragedy is decidedly triumphant allowing Kubo And The Two Strings to flex its reflective, throbbing mysterious muscles.", "Kubo and the Two Strings is not a film that any other Western animation studio would ever dream of creating. The deeply philosophical tale told here is far closer to Studio Ghibli than anything Pixar would be able to come up with.", "The point here is to savor the intricately animated action sequences and to drink in the potent mood of the piece, which brings a kinetic edge to Laika's signature detail-heavy, slightly melancholy production design", "Kubo and the Two Strings is one of the best films of the year and I highly recommend it. With its spectacular animation, thrilling action scenes, likable characters and a great message, Laika have officially cemented themselves as an animation powerhouse.", "A stunning piece of filmmaking from start to finish, telling a simple but appealing story that takes advantage of everything the medium of animation allows.", "Like the best of fairy tales and the best of animation, it is at its core an elementally human experience."], "rating": ["7/10", "", "", "", "", "", "4.5/5", "8.5/10", "A-", "", "A+", "B+", "9/10", "9/10", "4/4", "4/5", "3.5", "4.5/5", "9/10", "8/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Paul McGuire Grimes", "Avaryl Halley", "Andrew Galdi", "Dan Scully", "Chris McCoy", "Allison Rose", "Karl Delossantos", "Ryan Syrek", "Leah Schnelbach", "Rachel Wagner", "Preston Barta", "Britt Hayes", "Michelle Kisner", "Frank Ochieng", "Alistair Ryder", "Bob Chipman", "Harris Dang", "Jennifer Heaton", "Johnny Gayzmonic"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KSTP-TV (St. Paul, MN)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema76", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">FlickDirect", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Smash Cut Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Reader (Omaha, NE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tor.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fresh Fiction", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ScreenCrush", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Movie Sleuth", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">SF Crowsnest", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemole", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Geek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The AU Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternative Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fanboys of the Universe"], "date": ["December 5, 2020", "November 5, 2020", "May 6, 2020", "May 6, 2020", "March 31, 2020", "January 14, 2020", "September 4, 2019", "August 7, 2019", "July 9, 2019", "June 3, 2019", "April 12, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "February 20, 2019", "November 18, 2018", "November 9, 2018", "November 7, 2018", "November 4, 2018", "November 2, 2018", "November 1, 2018", "October 31, 2018"]}}
