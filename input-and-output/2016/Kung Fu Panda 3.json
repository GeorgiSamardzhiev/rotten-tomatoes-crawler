{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Living large and loving life, Po (Jack Black) realizes that he has a lot to learn if he's going to fulfill the next challenge from his beloved instructor (Dustin Hoffman). After reuniting with his long-lost father (Bryan Cranston), Po must transition from student to teacher and train a group of fun-loving, clumsy pandas to become martial-arts fighters. Together, the kung-fu brethren unite to take on the evil Kai (J.K. Simmons), a supernatural warrior who becomes stronger with each battle.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Animation", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Jennifer Yuh Nelson, Alessandro Carloni", "studio": "DreamWorksAnimation", "theater_date": "Jan 29, 2016", "dvd_date": "Jun 28, 2016", "box_office": "$143.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The rare sequel that holds up to the original. It's respectful to the story but more importantly it's respectful to the audiences who have grown to love these characters.", "Visually, everything continues to advance in sharpness and movement and flashiness.", "We've become part of the Valley of Peace and the world of Po and his friends and mentors.", "Perhaps a simple, good-hearted story with plenty of color, comedy, and action is all that people need. And if that's the case, Kung Fu Panda 3 does what it needs to.", "Flowing freely between styles inspired by anime, Pixar, and Asian woodcuts, Kung Fu Panda 3 is easily the most visually lush film DreamWorks has ever produced.", "Be it Panda-Rific, Perfectly Panda or Panda-monium, one thing is for certain when we're talking about Kung Fu Panda 3 - It's the Best.Panda.Ever.", "These are surprisingly strong but incredibly relevant themes for a children's movie, and Yuh continues to relay them with humor and grace.", "It's exciting, funny, sweet and I was consistently entertained. I want to give a special congrats to director Jennifer Yuh Nelson.", "Powered by humour, a plethora of colours, textures and - most importantly - a strong story, Kung Fu Panda 3 is a film that ensures the panda himself has a legacy.", "\"Kung Fu Panda 3\" is very well done, the characters fun, and the fight that Po has to handle, both personal and otherwise, make for an enjoyable animated feature that teaches good lessons, while still remaining entertaining.", "[Kung Fu Panda 3] is a film that, while undeniably familiar, still manages to retain a bit of freshness.", "Kung Fu Panda 3 may not have the same emotional impact as the first two films or the higher-level Pixar productions, but is still a solid bit of family entertainment.", "Thankfully, Kung Fu Panda 3 is just as fresh and frothy the third time around. Quite frankly, this infectious kiddie karate chop to the giddy soul is rather charming.", "It doesn't quite have the originality of the first film or the boldness of the second, but it still has heart where it counts.", "Kung Fu Panda 3 pushes the series forward towards its potential as a centerpiece of biculturalism.", "It really is a treat to watch, the care and attention are at their highest level and the wistful, emotionally beguiling visuals as integral to the film as the tip top voice work and articulate story.", "Mercifully, the entire enterprise is rescued by the arrival of some baby pandas. You can never go wrong with baby pandas, as Hitchcock never said.", "Although a slightly over-dramatic ending holds the film back from greater heights, this is on the whole, quite enjoyable for kids as well as adults.", "Animated movies especially, suffer the greatest drop in quality with sequels. But Kung Fu Panda 3 is a definite exception to the rule. The third instalment is just as quirky, funny and engaging as the first one.", "Long on pandas but distinctly short of magic, humour and, notably, the sort of visual spectacle we've come to expect."], "rating": ["4/5", "4/10", "3.5/4", "B-", "", "", "3/4", "A+", "4/5", "3.5/5", "4/5", "B", "3/4", "8.5/10", "", "4/5", "3/5", "3.5/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "Chris McCoy", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Matthew Lucas", "Rachel Wagner", "David Brake", "Mae Abdulbaki", "Allen Adams", "Micheal Compton", "Frank Ochieng", "Jennifer Heaton", "Jacob Oller", "Jamie Neish", "Alison Rowat", "Reagan Gavin Rasquinha", "Rachit Gupta", "Matthew Bond"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies with Mae", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Maine Edge", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Critical Movie Critics", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternative Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Vague Visages", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Herald (Scotland)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Times of India", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmfare", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Mail on Sunday (UK)"], "date": ["February 3, 2021", "December 5, 2020", "September 13, 2020", "July 13, 2020", "January 13, 2020", "November 5, 2019", "July 5, 2019", "April 16, 2019", "April 6, 2019", "April 5, 2019", "February 20, 2019", "January 16, 2019", "November 9, 2018", "November 1, 2018", "August 27, 2018", "August 13, 2018", "April 30, 2018", "November 7, 2017", "October 30, 2017", "October 24, 2017"]}}
