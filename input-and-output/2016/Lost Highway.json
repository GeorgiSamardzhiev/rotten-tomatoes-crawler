{"metadata": {"synopsis": "From this inventory of imagery, Lynch fashions two separate but intersecting stories, one about a jazz musician (Bill Pullman), tortured by the notion that his wife is having an affair, who suddenly finds himself accused of her murder. The other is a young mechanic (Balthazar Getty) drawn into a web of deceit by a temptress who is cheating on her gangster boyfriend. These two tales are linked by the fact that the women in both are played by the same actress (Patricia Arquette).", "rating": "61", "genre": "Drama/Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 15m", "director": "David Lynch", "studio": "OctoberFilms,LostHighwayProductions,AsymmetricalProductions", "theater_date": "Feb 21, 1997", "dvd_date": "Dec 13, 2016", "box_office": "$3.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Senses of unease and menace are soaked into every scene.
