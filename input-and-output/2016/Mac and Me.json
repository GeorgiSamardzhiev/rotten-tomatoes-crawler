[Full Review in Spanish]", "A film that warms your heart with rage, Mac and Me offers a constant stream of soulless corporate synergy. Like a 19th-century mountebank, the film peddles Coca-Cola as a life-saving elixir.", "A movie that continues to live in infamy.", "A blatant commercial for McDonald's and Coca-Cola disguised as an E.T. rip-off.", "Director Stewart Raffill's film is otherwise an unashamed rip-off of Spielberg's classic.", "It's an amazingly bald-faced copy of E. T. even though this is E. T. in a sticky wrapper, left under the heater two hours too long.", "A mercenary display of product placement and a bad advertisment for filmmaking.", "Possibly aware that they have something less than a classic on their hands, the makers of MAC and Me have cut their losses by making the film into a kind of cinematic billboard: all space is for sale.", "Everything about MAC and Me -- not least the fact that it's fairly well-made and involving -- smacks of crass calculation. The filmmakers even have the gall, in the movie's parting shot, to announce a sequel.", "Mac and Me simply is an uninspired, fast-food version of E.T., The Extraterrestrial.", "Mac and Me is a 99-minute commercial occasionally interrupted by a not-so-good children`s movie.", "So-bad-it's-good \"E.T.\" rip-off; lots of product placement.", "In addition to its lack of originality, Mac and Me is also blatantly commercial, selling everything from candy to soft drinks to fast-food restaurants.", "Give the kids a break; take them to something else.", "", "Watching it's made me a little stupider, buying it would have also dropped me a few social classes.", "Then there's Mac himself, a puppet which couldn't possibly look more like a puppet (a bad, shoddy puppet at that).", "E.T. rip-off and commercial placement-packed kid movie", "If you made a film about a homesick extraterrestrial befriended by a little boy, would you dare to have the creature look like E.
