Taking leave of his job as a janitor in Boston, Lee reluctantly returns to Manchester-by-the-Sea, the fishing village where his working-class family has lived for generations. There, he is forced to deal with a past that separated him from his wife, Randi (Michelle Williams), and the community where he was born and raised.", "rating": "96", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 17m", "director": "Kenneth Lonergan", "studio": "RoadsideAttractions,BigIndiePictures", "theater_date": "Dec 16, 2016", "dvd_date": "Feb 7, 2017", "box_office": "$47.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It deals with very real, very difficult human situations but does so with honesty and a great deal of unexpected humour and wisdom.", "The great moments are haunting, though they're buried deep within a numbing amount of extraneous normalcy.", "Manchester By The Sea doesn't play by the rules and that is its greatest asset as a film. It will break even the toughest cynic in the world.", "Despite the heart-breaking premise, the film is filled with unexpected moments of humour and warmth.", "Becomes nothing short of a remarkable piece of filmmaking.", "Kenneth Lonergan's film is a humane examination of the suffering of an ordinary man, whose terrible personal tragedy has emotionally crippled him.", "Whilst Manchester by the Sea didn't resonate with me entirely, it's hard to deny that capture of realism which works so well.", "Lonergan masterfully directs a humane film that explores a very simple concept, that is then expanded to reveal a redemption and mourning story. [Full review in Spanish]", "The film is the portrait not of a man but of his self-loathing, which needs an environment and community to reflect off of, like the moon reflects sunlight.", "Lonergan, who also writes the solid script, adjusts the film's gloomy background with cautious authorship that, while seemingly simple, is shamelessly profound. [Full review in Spanish]", "The film's only downside is that it reminds us how damn long it takes Lonergan to write and direct a movie. But if the results are this extraordinary, we'll somehow find a way to fill the gaps.", "Manchester by the Sea is one of the best films of the year. It's cathartic, and it reminds us that even in the dark waters of grief, we're never truly alone.", "The writer/director doesn't avoid the leg work and turns those minor indignities of everyday life into representations of inner turmoil.", "Despite the misery involved in this highly-emotional film, the finely-tuned script, along with outstanding performances, is reason enough to see this...", "Manchester by the Sea will restore your faith in the movies.", "Manchester by the Sea is a deeply affecting drama with a captivating turn by Casey Affleck.", "Though it sometimes settles into a monotonous dead zone, Manchester by the Sea is an exacting familial drama, rigidly held in place by a commendable supporting cast and what stands as Casey Affleck's most generous performance to date.", "Even if Manchester were not so technically accomplished and beautifully acted, it would still stand as a unique work, simply because you get the ineffable sense that the director has experienced himself what he's depicting on screen", "It's stunning, and Casey Affleck will just break your heart into splinters.", "Its visual modesty conveys the feeling that the director protects his characters, respecting their pain by diverting their eyes and giving them some space.
