A beautiful lie; a lie that provides a crucial glimpse into the past of a colonized culture. But a lie nonetheless.", "A delight.", "Don't go into Moana with Sound expecting an accurate anthropological depiction-just look forward to the drama and intergenerational negotiation of reality and fiction.", "Extraordinary cinematography is not enough to save the viewer from boredom.", "A fascinating portrait of South Seas life, albeit embellished.", "The imagery, in scenes that always unfold slowly, is truly startling, particularly given that the film is almost 90 years old.", "Moana is praiseworthy as a glimpse into Samoan life, but it is even more remarkable for [Robert] Flaherty's imagery.", "Flaherty's company are performing their lives and their ancestors' lives and Flaherty's idea of both, for him, for his camera, for the world of '26, for us today, for all time.", "A magnified travel film, it's interesting and has been well done, but there's no story, and a travelog is a travelog.", "Flaherty's sticky romanticism can't obscure the power of his images, which speak with an eloquence the intertitles lack.", "Flaherty catches it all by coming up with the needed stylistics as the occasions arise.", "It is a joyful and at the same time a thoroughly artistic contribution to motion pictures."], "rating": ["", "3/4", "8/10", "", "", "2/5", "4/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Wilella Waldorf", "Matthew Lucas", "Nathanael Hood", "Iris Barry", "Julia Raban", "Phil Hall", "Tom Keogh", "Glenn Kenny", "Daniel Eagan", "Alan Scherstuhl", "Variety Staff", "Dave Kehr", "Fernando F.
