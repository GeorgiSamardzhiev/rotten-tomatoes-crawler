{"metadata": {"synopsis": "For Momo (Pierre Boulanger), a young Jewish kid growing up in Paris in the early 1960s, life is pretty exciting. He's friends with many of the local prostitutes and loses his virginity to one of them, Sylvie (Anne Suarez). He also catches glimpses of a famous movie star (Isabelle Adjani) filming in his neighborhood. But it's his friendship with a Muslim shopkeeper, Ibrahim (Omar Sharif), that's the most rewarding part of his life. Gradually, the older man becomes a surrogate father to Momo.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 34m", "director": "Fran\u00e7ois Dupeyron", "studio": "France3Cin\u00e9ma", "theater_date": "Mar 12, 2004", "dvd_date": "Jan 7, 2014", "box_office": "$2.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "Unbearably life affirming and quasi-spiritual...
