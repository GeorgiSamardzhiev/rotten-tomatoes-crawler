He has a very specific style much like David Fincher or the Coen Brothers.", "The kind of film that will be discussed and debated amongst those few with balls enough to venture into the indieplex to check it out.", "...violent, pretentious and misanthropic.", "Nocturnal Animals is a dark and unforgiving film, filled with impressive performances and visuals, that will leave you with many questions and interpretations of what you just saw, as long as you realize what you're getting into before watching it.", "Details from the first half will come back to haunt you in the third act.
