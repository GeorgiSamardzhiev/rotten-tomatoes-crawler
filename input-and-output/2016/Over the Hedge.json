Lovable characters, wildly original slapstick routines, tearful heart tuggings, and most surprisingly, life-or-death dilemmas and environmental messages that will withstand repeated at-home viewings.", "The story has a loony, slapstick verve, and the star-studded voice work is uniformly entertaining.", "If Over the Hedge aims solely to entertain, it does so in a way that's mildly amusing but mostly hackneyed. If it aims to instruct, it weakens its own argument with the plethora of product tie-ins.", "A colorful and engaging comedy of suburbia's encroachment into the wilderness and its consequences for a motley crew of animals just awakened from hibernation.", "Adventure, cute and cuddly animals, and some wit make for a wonderful experience!", "A surprisingly very good animated adventure that relishes in simplicity...", "Caffeine freak critters, duplicitous raccoons, a highly talented cast and Bill Shatner in overacting overdrive -- it's like coming out of hibernation and waking in an animator's playground.", "The story is no grabber, and the sight gags are labored, but the animation is sleekly pretty, and it goes by painlessly enough.", "I watched the film with very low expectations and was pleasantly surprised by its heart and its humor.", "The final showdown, in which the critters tangle with security-rigged lawn flamingos and garden gnomes, would have made Rube Goldberg proud.", "A clever and fun escape from the summer blahs.", "A cookie-cutter money-spinner, finely tooled for maximum profit, but utterly lacking timeless charm.", "The new Dreamworks CGI animated feature ignores much of the satire and tries to cram the rest into the usual kids movie format.", "click to read full review in Greek", "The film's messages -- pro-family, pro-ecology, anti-consumerism -- sometimes feel forced.
