And the whole thing is glamorised by inventive visual compositions -- including touches of surrealism - and by Jack Cardiff's typically wonderful lighting.", "This is truly a somber, moody and eerie piece and you get bored with the mood in half an hour, when Lewin has barely got up steam for the long pull. He seems to relish it, though, and plunges ahead unrelentingly.", "Ava Gardner never looked lovelier, and two hours and three minutes never seemed longer, than in this pretentious semi-mystic romance.", "A simple love story, however improbable, can be enjoyed. But. this pair Indulge their love to the accompaniment of deep rumblings about fate and destiny... Their dialogue runs like a collection of philosophical cliches.", "Albert Lewin produced, wrote, and directed -- astonishingly, he managed to work again after this.", "As a whole the film is a daring departure and one which may leave many people perplexed.", "...it's the type of darkly fantastic tall tale you might hear told by a lovelorn old salt at a dockside bar.", "Lewin in his story and his screenplay adroitly mingles these ingredients, and sets the narrative amid the poetic and flamboyant landscapes of nature and life in Spain.", "Grant, too, that the production's enveloping luxury is nearly as seductive as Gardner, so steeped it is in warm tones and a rich palette. But like the hopeless fool's drawn to Pandora's ruinous beauty, so are we drawn to Gardner in all her magnetic glory.", "Allows us to focus on how Hollywood sexuality stemmed from biblical, Freudian, Jungian foundations. In every scene, the astoundingly gorgeous Gardner embodies all those ideals in contradiction.", "There are romance movies and then there's 'Pandora and the Flying Dutchman.' There's just nothing else quite like it.", "Lacks imagination.", "Its unique oddball blend of fatalistic Hemingway-esque masculinity, swoony romance and mythology, literary allusions...and grab bag of styles...makes Pandora and the Flying Dutchman nearly as hypnotic as the romance it retells. [Blu-ray]", "... there is a grace to the literary elegance and poetic dialogue of his script, and to the rich mix of European history, myths ancient and contemporary and Spanish culture...", "An intoxicating (or, possibly, intoxicated) mixture of surrealistic grandeur and balderdash, this 1951 movie sails on Jack Cardiff's succulent Technicolor cinematography.", "Jack Cardiff's superb Technicolor cinematography looks as beautiful as Gardner and that's substantially the reason the film has stood the test of time.", "It's one of those unclassifiable efforts that threaten permanently to topple over the edge of ridiculousness, but somehow manage to avoid it."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "8/10", "", "4/4", "B-", "3/4", "", "", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["TIME Staff", "Variety Staff", "Virginia Graham", "Edward Porter", "Harry MacArthur", "Clyde Gilmour", "Bruce Grant", "Anthony Quinn", "Robin Slessor", "David Bax", "Edwin Schallert", "Andy Crump", "Armond White", "Jeffrey M.
