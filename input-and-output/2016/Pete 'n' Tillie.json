{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Pete (Walter Matthau) and Tillie (Carol Burnett) are middle-aged and meet at a time in their lives when both have developed a layer of cynicism about love and relationships. Wisecracking Pete hides behind an almost pathological need to tell jokes, while Tillie is a bit too uptight to let herself go. Gradually, through various ups and downs, they become a couple, get married -- despite Pete's reservations -- and have a child. After tragedy strikes, their marriage is tested.", "rating": "80", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Martin Ritt", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 25, 2011", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Character driven story with nice work by Matthau and Burnett.", "The mixture of happiness and grief, laughter and sobs, reality and farce makes this an admirable attempt at great filmmaking.", "It gets taken over by a series of soap-style catastrophes.", "This is the wittiest, warmest and most ingratiating movie to appear in a long time, with a beautifully sustained and muted edge of sadness.", "Director Ritt keeps the gags coming, but it is the two leads' chemistry that makes the film work."], "rating": ["3/5", "3.5/4", "", "4.5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Steve Crum", "", "", "Howard Thompson", "Film4 Staff"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Video-Reviewmaster.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4"], "date": ["June 13, 2008", "January 14, 2008", "June 24, 2006", "May 9, 2005", "May 24, 2003"]}}
