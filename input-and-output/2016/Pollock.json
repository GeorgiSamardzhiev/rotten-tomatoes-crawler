{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In August of 1949, Life Magazine ran a banner headline that begged the question: \"Jackson Pollock: Is he the greatest living painter in the United States?\" The film is a look back into the life of an extraordinary man, a man who has fittingly been called \"an artist dedicated to concealment, a celebrity who nobody knew.\" As he struggled with self-doubt, engaging in a lonely tug-of-war between needing to express himself and wanting to shut the world out, Pollock began a downward spiral.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 58m", "director": "Ed Harris", "studio": "PollockFilms,Brant-Allen,ZekeProductions,FredBernerFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$8.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["a plodding glimpse of the latter part of Jackson Pollock's life", "For better and worse, Pollock is an Action Painterly picture, an ambitious work of ambiguous surfaces.", "Wonderful movie, but for adults and older teens.", "In the same way a tap dancer innately understands the percolating syncopation of all jazz music, Ed Harris identifies character rhythms and physical possibilities in drama.", "", "", "", "Many films about artists indulge opportunities to depict people behaving recklessly.
