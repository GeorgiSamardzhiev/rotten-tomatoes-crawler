{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Jean (Jean Gabin) is an army deserter who arrives in Le Havre, France, planning to leave the country on one of the many ships anchored there. He gets distracted in the foggy port city, however, when he falls in love with the lovely Nelly (Mich\u00e8le Morgan). Jean faces some sinister competition, as Nelly is caught between the influence of her overbearing godfather (Michel Simon) and a petty gangster (Pierre Brasseur). Jean wants to skip town with Nelly, but tempers are escalating quickly.", "rating": "96", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 31m", "director": "Marcel Carn\u00e9", "studio": "Cin\u00e9-Alliance", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 20, 2004", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There's a melancholy humanism employed in their characterization which allows for the otherwise simple story to maintain its tragic appeal.", "Because it is so uncompromising, so pure, \"Port of Shadow's\" particularly French brand of romantic fatalism still knocks us out decades after the fact.", "This collaboration of Marcel Carne and Jacques Prevert is a highlight of French poetic realism and a masterpiece of world cinema.", "We empathize with their resistance to suffer, but it's hard to feel something other than philosophical respect for characters who think of swimmers as soon-to-be drowned men.", "From Gabin's fatigued magnetism to cinematographer Eugen Schfftan's woodcut-worthy attention to texture, this is movie melancholia of the very highest order.", "As a film that neither attempts more than it can do nor is satisfied with the trivial, Port of Shadows is a pleasure.", "[A] 1938 masterpiece of poetic realism...", "Carn's thrilling film is an important and undervalued influence on the post-war American noirs of the 1940s.", "One of the definitive examples of the 'poetic realism' style of French cinema of the pre-war and wartime years...", "Pessimistic, yet strangely sublime.", "The results are frustrating, though Michel Simon is wonderfully vulnerable as the shopkeeper Zabel, who complains about the injustice of loving like Romeo but looking like Bluebeard.", "What is often forgotten when discussing poetic realism is how entertaining the films are, and none is more so than Le Quai des Brumes.", "Marcel Carn's film has fully earned its status as a classic of French poetic realism.", "Essentially, this is film noir, so there's crime and romance, but both are submerged beneath a resolutely ground-level exploration of lives in crisis -- a mood bolstered by shots of the down-and-dirty French port groaning into action.", "Predictably, all ends tragically. But mondieu, doesn't it look sublime?", "This marvelous distillation of the prevailing mood in prewar France was the first feature to win critical acclaim for the directing-writing team of Marcel Carne and Jacques Prevert.", "Not a cheerful evening's viewing, this, but a superb and compelling example of melancholic realism.", "It's a thorough-going study in blacks and grays, without a free laugh in it; but it is also a remarkably beautiful motion picture from the purely pictorial standpoint and a strangely haunting drama.", "One of the reasons the French so readily accepted the American film noir of the 1940s is because they already had it in the 1930s, and this crime drama is proof of that.", ""], "rating": ["4/5", "5/5", "A", "3/4", "5/5", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "5/5", "3/5", "", "5/5", "4/5", "5/5", "4/4", "5/5", "4.5/5", "B", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "Kenneth Turan", "Emanuel Levy", "Diego Semerene", "Eric Hynes", "Otis Ferguson", "Philip French", "Shaun Munro", "Miles Fielder", "Peter Bradshaw", "Leo Robson", "Paul Huckerby", "Philip Concannon", "Dave Calhoun", "Philip Kemp", "", "David Parkinson", "Frank S.
