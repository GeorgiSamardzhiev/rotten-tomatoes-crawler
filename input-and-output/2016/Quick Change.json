{"metadata": {"synopsis": "With the aid of his girlfriend, Phyllis Potter (Geena Davis), and best friend, Loomis (Randy Quaid), Grimm (Bill Murray) enters a Manhattan bank dressed as a clown, creates a hostage situation and executes a flawless robbery. The only thing left for the trio to do is make their getaway out of the city and to the airport. It sounds simple enough, but it seems that fate deserts them immediately after the bank heist. One mishap after another conspires to keep these robbers from reaching freedom.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Howard Franklin", "studio": "DevotedProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2009", "box_office": "$14.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A funny, quirky and engaging very NYC dark comedy.", "Plenty of '80s comedies would've just ridden the clown-robbing-a-bank premise for 90 minutes. Instead, 'Quick Change' tosses off its twist twenty minutes in, discovering that the real achievement is not knocking off a bank, but getting out of New York.", "Smarter, even more literate, than it needs to be.", "Quick Change requires a leap of faith from the audience.", "", "Easily a top-five career highlight for Bill Murray, Quick Change is a comedy jewel, squeezing a rare amount of mileage out of its fickle star, who appears atypically invested in the picture's mechanics.", "The movie has a comfy, lived-in feel; it doesn't beat you over the head for laughs, or take its horrors-of-New York theme too seriously. Smile and enjoy.", "[Murray's] glancing, genial sarcasm buoys the action for the first half-hour. Then this caper comedy sinks into a puddle of urban rancor.", "After piquing our curiosity, Murray and Franklin skillfully let us in on the scheme and slowly reveal the nature of the three characters at the center of it.", "Neither ambitious nor particularly memorable, but it's brought off with a sly flair that makes it most enjoyable.", "From the opening scenes with Murray dressed as a clown for the robbery and playing his cynical, wise-cracking card to great effect, to the trio pitting themselves against the whims of New York City, this is breathtaking and inventive stuff.", "Funny fluff featuring clowns, a bank robbery, and Bill Murray.", "Not likely to set the world alight, but a neat and engaging little comedy of bad manners.", "Inventively sinister, endlessly hilarious dark comedy.", "", "", "", "There is not much in Quick Change that hasn't been anticipated by Neil Simon and beaten to death by countless imitators.
