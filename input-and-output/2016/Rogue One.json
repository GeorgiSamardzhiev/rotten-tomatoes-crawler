But Rogue One gave us something different in its standalone approach. It reinforces the simple notion of hope and change and the true cost of conflict and war.", "Rogue One is exciting and action-packed...the type of stand-alone, peripheral Star Wars film [George Lucas] should've been making during the years between Jedi and the prequels, instead of continually tinkering with what we already had.", "It's indicative of where this franchise is going. Actually, let me correct that: it's indicative of where this franchise isn't going.", "In Rogue One, [Gareth] Edwards has made the most realistic of Star Wars than any before -- and with that, also the most mature and grown-up one.", "This feels like grown-up Star Wars.", "It's a space opera that despite having tiny periods of digital surprises, it runs out of steam. [Full review in Spanish]", "It was real and it was bleak.", "I think the main reason I liked this movie so much is because the characters all seemed grounded and real.", "Boosted immeasurably by Michael Giacchino's rousing score, Rogue One moves at a breakneck pace and pulls us in with visuals that are both awe-inspiring and very much grounded in reality.", "The film is fun, it's enjoyable, it was exciting at times even, but something felt like it was missing or off.", "Rogue One is muscular blockbuster filmmaking that also has a heart and an ethical code.", "Unlike any other franchise, a new Star Wars movie can be considered a life event (I can pinpoint where I saw each one of the prequels and Episode VII). Make it a special one, the movie does its part.", "Rogue One is a prequel done right, and it succeeds by focusing on the details.", "The visual splendor of Rogue One often gets ignored, but few images can haunt an audience like The Death Star coming up over the horizon.", "A middling expansion of the Star Wars universe with more style than heart."], "rating": ["", "", "6/10", "7.5/10", "", "3/5", "", "B-", "", "B+", "6/10", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "4/5", "", "4/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Joey Morona", "David Bax", "Mike Massie", "Tony Asankomah", "Paul McGuire Grimes", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Damond Fudge", "Allen Almachar", "Akhil Arora", "Brent McKnight", "Yasser Medina", "Andrew Galdi", "Avaryl Halley", "Steven Prokopy", "Emilie Black", "Tim Brennan", "Jorge Ignacio Castillo", "Chris McCoy", "Alan French", "Aly Caviness"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cleveland Plain Dealer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Battleship Pretension", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">GhMovieFreak", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KSTP-TV (St. Paul, MN)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Confessions From A Geek Mind", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KCCI (Des Moines, IA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gadgets360", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Third Coast Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">About Boulder", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Planet S Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">We Bought a Blog", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Midwest Film Journal"], "date": ["January 27, 2021", "January 4, 2021", "December 5, 2020", "November 20, 2020", "November 5, 2020", "July 17, 2020", "July 14, 2020", "July 13, 2020", "July 3, 2020", "July 2, 2020", "June 27, 2020", "May 8, 2020", "May 8, 2020", "April 28, 2020", "April 19, 2020", "February 13, 2020", "February 5, 2020", "January 15, 2020", "December 22, 2019", "December 6, 2019"]}}
