{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Life is good for all the food items that occupy the shelves at the local supermarket. Frank (Seth Rogen) the sausage, Brenda (Kristen Wiig) the hot dog bun, Teresa Taco and Sammy Bagel Jr. (Edward Norton) can't wait to go home with a happy customer. Soon, their world comes crashing down as poor Frank learns the horrifying truth that he will eventually become a meal. After warning his pals about their similar fate, the panicked perishables devise a plan to escape from their human enemies.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Animation/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 29m", "director": "Conrad Vernon, Greg Tiernan", "studio": "SonyMusic,PointGrey,AnnapurnaPictures,ColumbiaPictures", "theater_date": "Aug 12, 2016", "dvd_date": "Nov 4, 2016", "box_office": "$97.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One of those see-it-to-believe-it sort of pictures, sporting visual jokes that are routinely as amusing as they are horrific or disgusting.", "One of this year's most incredibly hilarious and incredibly hopeful films.", "Despite the positive beginnings, Sausage Party is painfully unfunny, relying on the same crude humour throughout its 90 minute runtime.", "For fans of cartoons saying and doing inappropriate things.", "Is there anything redeemable about Sausage Party at all? Sort of - the animation is good... quality of the animation aside, there is simply nothing to recommend within this obnoxious, repugnant and most heinously, unfunny, waste of digital space.", "This is one animated film that is not for children. Fans of the Rogen/Goldberg flavor of raunchy comedy, however, will find that Sausage Party is the duo's greatest achievement.", "It somehow manages to shock despite the lines Rogen and Goldberg (who helped write the screenplay) have crossed before in Superbad and This Is the End.", "This is a film to see with friends who are game for an explicite but smart and clever movie.", "I dub Sausage Party \"The soft porn of the animated food industry\".", "In addition to the originality of the proposal, its irreverent spirit or the inevitable parodies and references, one of its biggest hooks is the vocal cast, which bring nuances and humor to its characters. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Its jokes raise smiles and their journey through the more corrosive side of humor makes it easy for us to buy the idea, but watch out, the expiration date is not very far. [Full Review in Spanish]", "If it stands, this will mark the first film where injecting bath salts is a key plot point and in which taco-on-hot-dog-bun action bubbles with sexy innuendo to ever break into critics' top 10 lists.", "If you're settling in for a stoner flick, you will feel short-changed by what is essentially a political lecture from Seth Rogen. Aside from a fantastic performance from Edward Norton, you will likely be disappointed.", "It's a raunchy, curseword-laden cartoon that might also be the closest thing to an art film that we've seen as a major studio summer release in years.", "It's a Pixar-esque animated world turned on its head -- full of raunch but also full of some astute observations that make it as smart as it is dirty.", "SAUSAGE PARTY is a testament that film can still be shocking. [Seth] Rogen and [Evan] Goldberg always go for shock and this film's existence is proof that there's value in that fact alone.", "Its foul and raunchy, pearl-clutching humor slaps you in the face every single second of the movie, and while some of it is silly (even stupid) for the most part the jokes stick the landing.", "This was an absolute genius idea to create a rated-R animated film, and I hope there are more to come.", "Sausage Party appears to be written by a group of 11 year olds who have just heard curse words for the first time, but have never heard a single joke in their lives.", "It is, simply stated, piss-your-pants funny - both in that I laughed almost hard enough to do that and in that it's the sort of humor where \"pissing your pants\" would be an actual punchline."], "rating": ["6/10", "3.5/4", "2/5", "C", "", "", "4.2", "", "4.5/5", "", "", "A", "2/5", "4/5", "B", "B-", "8/10", "", "1.5/5", "3.5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Brent McKnight", "Andrew F.
