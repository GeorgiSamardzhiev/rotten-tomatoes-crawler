You just earned yourself a lifetime pass from geeks everywhere.", "A lovely example of TV sci-fi doing what it does best, and with an amount of money that no TV sci-fi ever had at its disposal.", ". . .it's got plenty of sci-fi soul food including tough-talking space cowboys with marshmallow hearts, blistering boobie babes, sassy sidekicks and blood thirsty savages.", "Whedon's years in TV have helped him hone a clean, efficient, entertaining style grounded in character, camaraderie and his trademark dialogue...", "After suffering through a summer crammed with TV shows being remade into movies, it's refreshing to see a movie based on a TV show that is so entertaining that it actually makes you want to go and see the show of which the movie was created.", "New viewers will be a little bit lost, and old fans won't get quite everything they wanted, but there's enough going on in Serenity and it's all so much fun that it doesn't matter.", "In the end you are left with the feeling that Whedon works better on television than in the cinema.", "Hardcore fans will undoubtedly be satisfied but its unlikely this will spread much beyond that audience, and even they will find it lacks that human spark and freshness that made the series distinctive and appealing.", "For what it is -- viewed as filmmaking in and of itself -- Serenity is tense and smoothly put together.", "A magnificent closer to the series, and Whedon shows how much love he has for his fans by giving us a quality finisher...", "Joss Whedon makes a rousing feature-directing debut, exploiting the cult status of his short-lived series Firefly to continue it on the big screen.", "Firefly finally has the triumphant finale fans longed for: the excitingly tense, often surprising and even more frequently comical Serenity. Fans will rejoice.", "The settings and tone are hyper-real, yet the human behaviour is grounded and credible, the moral conflicts complex and involving. Shiny, intelligent fun.", "In the context of an action cinema driven by false hope, misogyny and sadism, Serenity is an inspiring respite.", "The movie is a sci-fi buccaneer swashbuckler; Whedon hits all the obligatory space-opera notes, and he does it with a degree of verbal wit and agile pacing that could teach George Lucas a thing or two.", "Go out and see Joss Whedon's witty whizbang of an action movie, or we will kill a kitten.", "Has a simultaneously sprawling yet intimate quality."], "rating": ["", "C", "4/5", "1", "4/5", "", "", "8/10", "7/10", "2.5/5", "", "3/5", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "4/5", "", "B"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Kathi Maio", "Micheal Compton", "Miles Fielder", "Aaron Peterson", "Tim Brayton", "Dorothy Woodend", "Sean Axmaker", "Jeffrey Lyles", "Joshua Starnes", "Keith H.
