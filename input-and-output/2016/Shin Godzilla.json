[Full review in Spanish]", "Shin Godzilla is the Dunkirk of Godzilla movies.", "The human characters fall flat, and the undeniably dodgy special effects will put many off, but it's an entertaining slice of B-movie nonsense that recalls the earliest days of the iconic franchise.", "Movie Review: Shin Godzilla", "...quite possibly the best Godzilla film since the first one in 1954.", "Overall, this is a great update to the franchise and I cannot wait to see where they go next with it.", "The famed and humongous rumble-and-tumble reptile makes a grand return courtesy of Toho Studios reviving the catastrophic critter in writer/co-director Hideaki Anno's and Shinji Higuchi's monster mash offering 'Godzilla Resurgence' (aka 'Shin Godzilla')", "With its satirical and topical humour, glorious scenes of destruction and a fresh coat of paint, Shin Godzilla [Godzilla Resurgence] lived up to the buzz and exceeded my expectations in every single way.", "The bottom line is that Shin Godzilla is a must-see for any fan of Godzilla movies, but also for people who are simply interested in where Japanese pop culture is headed in the 21st century.", "Seamlessly blends majestic spectacle with such resounding soul.", "Thus, Shin Godzilla acquires the epic dimensions of a brutally and joyfully brainless monster movie... [Full review in Spanish]", "Shin Godzilla is a film filled with far more government meetings than Godzilla action. A lack of compelling characters and an abundance of bureaucracy make Godzilla's big screen return a let-down.", "Audiences may feel let down by the visualisation of the monster.... Until you realise that's exactly what it is -- a modern tribute to the thoroughly Japanese Godzillas that have gone before.", "What Shin Godzilla does offer is one major counter: Godzilla's real home is Japan, and anything else feels like a glitzy vacation.", "Thirty-one films and 63 years later, the monster has seldom looked better. The final shot will haunt your dreams.", "Directed by Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi, it has an excellent Godzilla, whose rampages are a good mixture of modern and traditional-looking special effects. Often, though, the monster is out of the action.", "Coming off like a peculiar mash-up of The Host and Dr Strangelove, Shin Godzilla is weirdly paced but does add a new twist to the old formula.", "This enjoyable but dialogue-heavy addition to the Godzilla family takes aim at the inert, top-heavy bureaucracy of Japanese government."], "rating": ["", "", "4.5/5", "", "3/5", "4/5", "A", "7/10", "3/4", "5/5", "", "", "3/5", "4/10", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["CJ Sheu", "Panos Kotzathanasis", "Emmanuel B\u00e1ez", "Richard Trenholm", "Phil W.
