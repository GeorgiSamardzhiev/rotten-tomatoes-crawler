{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After returning from their honeymoon and showing home movies to their friends, Shrek and Fiona learn that her parents have heard that she has married her true love and wish to invite him to their kingdom, called Far Far Away. The catch is: Fiona's parents are unaware of the curse that struck their daughter and have assumed she married Prince Charming, not a 700-pound ogre with horrible hygiene and a talking donkey pal.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Animation/Comedy/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Andrew Adamson", "studio": "DreamWorksSKG,PacificDataImages(PDI)", "theater_date": "May 19, 2004", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$436.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Introduces one of the most lovable and laughable characters in animation history: Puss in Boots.", "Shrek 2 actually tells a creative story and doesn't just make fun of the fairytale genre but subverts it in some clever ways.", "It's just as good - if not better - than the original.", "The animation by which it stands or falls is as brilliant as ever and, though it wouldn't really be right to call it totally anti-Disney, it certainly trumps that institution for sharpness of focus, notably as far as the screenplay is concerned.", "All hail the angriest rebel since James Dean. All right, he's green, pot-bellied, and has the social graces of a slug. But in terms of attitude? Peerless.", "Go and see Shrek 2. You'll enjoy yourself thoroughly. Only the churlish could find any faults.", "Donkey, with his endless asides and phenomenally thick skin, is as much of a pleasure as he was in the first film, but he has a challenger: Puss in Boots, voiced by Antonio Banderas.", "Don't get me wrong. I'm not sulking. I liked Shrek 2. Honest. Kids will like Shrek 2. Most mums and dads will like Shrek 2. My problem is this: I didn't love it the way I loved Shrek.", "There's no denying that Shrek 2 is fun, but it's fun without substance, and like the bubbles in the Fairy Godmother's potions, it evaporates quickly.", "It's a close call as to which one's better.", "It's not often that a sequel is richer and deeper than the original creation, especially when we're talking about the offerings of Hollywood. But Shrek 2 is the exception.", "The characters are still charming, the animation really is spectacularly smooth and expressive, and the Looney Tunes-style humor and pop-culture in-jokes are as inventive and hilarious as before.", "Shrek 2 is as much of a shriek as the original and if they keep putting out films as charming as this one, we'll all live happily ever after.", "Like the original, Shrek 2 remains exceptional value for money for all age groups and essential winter viewing.", "There's no narrative, just half-hearted episodes punctuated by occasionally brilliant shtick.", "Shrek 2 retains all the fun, artistry and pop stylings of Shrek.", "The movie is obvious, but consistently entertaining and animated in DreamWorks's \"realistic\" digitized style.", "Shrek 2 does not feel like a sequel. It's very funny, very fresh, and leaves one anxious for the next installment.", "If fall movies were this consistently clever, there would never be reason to hesitate before plunking down hard-earned bucks at the multiplex.", "There's plenty of subtle satire and double entendres for young and old alike to savour."], "rating": ["8/10", "B-", "5/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "3/5", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "4/5", "5/5", "", "", "3.5/5", "", "4/5", "3.5/4", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Rachel Wagner", "Kevin Carr", "Derek Malcolm", "James Christopher", "Miranda Sawyer", "Philippa Hawker", "Cosmo Landesman", "Nanciann Cherry", "Matt Soergel", "Dan Webster", "Jim Lane", "Kerry Bashford", "Chris Stead", "Mark Steyn", "Megan Spencer", "David Denby", "Dan DeMaggio", "Leah Rozen", "Alan Jones"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fat Guys at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Statesman", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Age (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sunday Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Toledo Blade", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Florida Times-Union", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spokesman-Review (Washington)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sacramento News &amp; Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MovieFIX", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">FILMINK (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">sbs.com.au", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro Times (Detroit, MI)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times"], "date": ["November 9, 2020", "March 11, 2019", "January 17, 2016", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "December 6, 2014", "November 25, 2013", "November 25, 2013", "November 25, 2013", "November 25, 2013"]}}
