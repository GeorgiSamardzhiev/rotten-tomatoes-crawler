No holocaust movie should be a thriller. Hungarian first timer Laszlo Nemes's Auschwitz set drama is at once riveting and quietly devastating experience and it doesn't feel like a gimmick.", "Son of Saul presents a gargantuan moral victory in the face of incomprehensible evil.", "Its jagged stylistic urgency [makes] it unlike any prior Holocaust drama", "Nemes also achieves a cinema separated from sentimentality that offers a sober, unavoidable and gloomy glimpse of dehumanization in times of war. [Full review in Spanish]", "L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Nemes believes in the viewer's capabilities and gives him an intelligent, hard and real film. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Son of Saul is a film of considerable virtuosity, a harrowing film like no other before it.", "Absolutely worth your time.", "This film will certainly stick with you. That's for sure.", "It's a deeply harrowing experience.", "The horror around him remains blurred; we only hear it. It's still hard to watch. But as the story of one man's relentless quest for a glimmer of nobility, Son of Saul earns its right to be unforgettable.", "Son of Saul is a powerful reminder that things can get bad awfully quick if we're not paying attention.", "Technically astounding and emotionally resonant, only the feeling that we never fully understand Saul or his motivations (despite spending the entire film with him) lets Son of Saul down.", "Beyond hope and fear, it's a story where there are no miracles, no resolution and no-one survives. It's unforgettable.", "It's not literally filmed in a single take or real-time, but Nemes' storytelling mastery approximates that sensibility as we follow Saul through his haunting sensory journey.", "It's expectedly an awful time at the movies, but also an important and problematic work that can't be dismissed.", "I'm not sure there are many of you strong enough to even read about it without getting teary.", "Son of Saul employs the formal mechanics of filmmaking to turn [its] ... questions back in on and around themselves, doing what cinema does best in the hands of great filmmakers: showing by not showing, telling by not telling.", "There are sights here that will never be erased from memory, and nor should they be, but there are also moments when hope and decency shine from the screen.", "Altogether, I rate Son of Saul as one of the few masterpieces of 21st-century cinema.", "Their slim hope for survival, dramatized in a planned revolt that dovetails with Saul's own quest, can only have one outcome, but it's a testament to Nemes' prowess that he keeps our interest, and earns our empathy, all the way through."], "rating": ["", "", "", "8/10", "", "", "", "1", "4.5/5", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5", "", "", "", "5/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Dustin Chang", "David Bax", "Dennis Harvey", "Yasser Medina", "Luc\u00eda Ros Serra", "Elissa Suh", "Leslie Combemale", "Rachel Wagner", "Kate Rodger", "Brian D.
