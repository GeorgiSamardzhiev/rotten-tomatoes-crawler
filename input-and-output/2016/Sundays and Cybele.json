{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Pierre (Hardy Kruger) is a former pilot in the French military, haunted by a traumatic wartime experience that resulted in the death of a child. When he sees 12-year-old Cybele (Patricia Gozzi) stranded at a neighborhood orphanage, he convinces the staff that he's her father, so that they can spend Sunday afternoons together, bonding over their shared loneliness. But their platonic relationship is misinterpreted by Pierre's nurse (Nicole Courcel) and others.", "rating": "44", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 50m", "director": "Serge Bourguignon", "studio": "Columbia", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 30, 2014", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Hardy Kruger as the anguished ex-airman is seldom more expressive than a robot, and the story's implied protest against mob-minded callousness is both banal and fuzzy.", "It is really the latest hat from Paris and, like its predecessors... is memorable only because it is trimmed with the most tasteful photographic effects. Like them, however, it struck me as more decorative than substantial.", "Serge Bourguignon won the Oscar for best foreign language film with this self-promoting, arty affair, which countered the stylistic departures of the nouvelle vague by returning to French cinema's much-derided poetic tradition.", "Expect more resistance than usual to the implication that it's a classic ripe for the canon. Changing times do evolve past some things.", "Director Bourguignon does not seem to understand that what is infantile is not necessarily childlike and certainly not charming.", "Serge Bourguignon treats a sensitive subject with grace here to create a warm, often poignant film, although his presentation tends to call attention to the film's style at the expense of substance.", "This charming French film about the friendhsip between a German soldier and a French girl was nominated for the 1962 Foreign Language Oscar.", "This makes a slow but pictorially impressive film due to new director Serge Bourguignon's feeling for imagery and style.
