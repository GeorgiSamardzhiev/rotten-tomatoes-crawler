{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1968, Michael (Robert De Niro), Nick (Christopher Walken) and Steven (John Savage), lifelong friends from a working-class Pennsylvania steel town, prepare to ship out overseas following Steven's elaborate wedding and one final group hunting trip. In Vietnam, their dreams of military honor are quickly shattered by the inhumanities of war; even those who survive are haunted by the experience, as is Nick's hometown sweetheart, Linda (Meryl Streep).", "rating": "92", "genre": "Cult Movies/Drama", "runtime": "3h 3m", "director": "Michael Cimino", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 2, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The Deer Hunter is a movie of bad guys and good guys, and the bad guys are not us.", "The film ultimately works because of the inherent dramatics of the script, the magnificent cinematography/editing and the performances of Walken, DeNiro and Streep.", "A decidedly bitter, realistic, and harrowing anti-war epic.", "The depiction of Vietnam, and then the subsequent aftermath in the third act of the film, is more potent and visceral because we feel the impact of the war on an entire community, not just on the three men we follow there.", "Powerfully acted by all involved (especially Christopher Walken and Meryl Streep) and infused with numerous gut-wrenching scenes.", "...certainly a bit long and could use some trimming.", "Totally unforgettable.", "[The Deer Hunter] is the most ambitious attempt to grapple with the subject that has yet been released. Its vision -- an effort to weave the inferno of Vietnam into the homespun texture of American life -- is effectively realized and savagely gripping.", "The wayward, maddening screenplay succeeds only in working up a gruesome melodramatic later -- hardly the catharsis promised by a bold treatment of the wounds of our most divisive war.", "The director, Michael Cimino, on his second movie, has an incredible, prodigal gift for making movies, knowing that editing is the shape and life behind film.", "To my mind, The Deer Hunter is a major achievement in American movies. And I fervently hope that the American public won't vote me wrong.", "The Deer Hunter is a work of staggering scope and ambition: an epic treatise on the malignancy running through American civilian and political life in the 1970s.", "While it's fair to argue that The Deer Hunter contains moments of brilliance, the film as a whole is undone by its length.", "Just crazy enough to capture something of the madness of Vietnam, domesticated enough that it's mostly something concrete that you put your arms around.", "Epic war drama is extremely intense and graphically violent.", "The performances are unforgettable, particularly by Christopher Walken as the dreamy, masochistic, Russian-looking Nick.", "The movie won five Oscars and, if anything, improves with age.", "The Deer Hunter is a rich and powerful picture that without a trace of patronisation or the slightest touch of cultural superiority, speaks eloquently for the inarticulate.", "It has no more moral intelligence than the Clint Eastwood action pictures, yet it's an astonishing piece of work, an uneasy mixture of violent pulp and grandiosity, with an enraptured view of common life -- poetry of the commonplace.", "In trying to measure the devastating impact of Vietnam on the lives of three American soldiers, Cimino brings home the true horror of that senseless conflict in a way that the 6 O'Clock News never could."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "1", "", "4/4", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "3/4", "9/10", "4/5", "", "5/5", "", "", "4/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Marina Hirsch", "Richard Propes", "Mike Massie", "Ed Travis", "Matt Brunson", "Danielle Solzman", "Leigh Paatsch", "Rick Chatenever", "Gary Arnold", "Lawrence O&#39;Toole", "Arthur Knight", "PJ Nabarro", "James Berardinelli", "Tim Brayton", "Barbara Shulgasser", "Ted Whitehead", "Kate Muir", "Philip French", "Pauline Kael", "Kathleen Carroll"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Berkeley Barb", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinapse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Frenzy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Solzy at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Santa Cruz Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Maclean&#39;s Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ReelViews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Observer (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News"], "date": ["January 11, 2021", "September 5, 2020", "August 29, 2020", "June 13, 2020", "May 30, 2020", "May 26, 2020", "April 24, 2020", "February 5, 2020", "February 5, 2020", "January 27, 2020", "December 18, 2018", "December 16, 2018", "October 8, 2018", "December 5, 2016", "October 19, 2016", "February 17, 2016", "March 2, 2015", "March 2, 2015", "March 2, 2015", "February 18, 2015"]}}
