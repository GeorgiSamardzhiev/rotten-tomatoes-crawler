{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The young son of a diplomat, Phillipe (Bobby Henrey), often finds himself alone. To entertain the boy, the household butler, Baines (Ralph Richardson), creates adventurous stories of his past. As a result, Phillipe idolizes the servant, seeing him as a hero. But when Baines' wife (Sonia Dresdel) falls to her death, the police believe Baines was behind it. Phillipe, who witnessed the event, will do anything to protect the butler -- but he only makes things worse by doing so.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 34m", "director": "Carol Reed", "studio": "BritishLionFilmCorporation,LondonFilmProduction", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 18, 2016", "box_office": "$58.1K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's all quite moving and nerve-wracking - and believable.", "One of the movies' great treatises on the projection and (ultimate) limitations of a child's inner-world.", "Written by the great Graham Greene, the film builds up pressure subtly over time, creating an entire narrative around the cascading consequences of dishonesty.", "The Fallen Idol is a fascinating film for how it manages to develop inner turmoil and for its earnest interest in the perspective of a child.", "The Fallen Idol is one of the best achieved examples in cinema of seeing the world through the eyes of a child.", "The Fallen Idol finds innocence and inquisitiveness at odds with corruption, violence, desire, deceit - all the stuff that grown-ups trade in.", "In some ways an even more brilliant contraption than \"The Third Man,\" and with a third act that might be superior, too.", "The Fallen Idol stands as one of the great films about looking, about perspective, about the way we watch and interpret not just film plots but each other.", "The film is first-class entertainment.", "... one of the great films of innocence lost and a powerful portrait of the powerlessness of children in the adult world, where they are so often ignored or discounted.", "It's a gripping mystery story involving adult secrets, childhood lies and betrayal as part of the human equation.", "", "separates itself from what would otherwise be a rather rote drama/thriller.", "Watching The Fallen Idol is like setting off one of those milelong mazes of dominoes, with ramps and loop-de-loops and sheer drops. First, every element is ingeniously set up; then, everything falls into place.", "Many themes are tragic, but Fallen Idol also extols the resilience of innocence.", "As a portrait of the sometime destructiveness of innocence and as a sharp fresco of post-war Britain, this movie is a little masterpiece, an idol that has never fallen.", "It's a masterful and unsentimental child's-eye view of the cold, hard adult world.", "This earlier pairing between the two masters is another well-crafted and thought-provoking film.
