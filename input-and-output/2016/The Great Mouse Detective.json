While incomplete, it was this vision that would make them viable again.", "Older kids may be less enthused by this mousy story, though parents, particularly Basil Rathbone fans, will marvel at the accuracy with which this sophisticated homage hits Holmes.", "An attractive idea, but rather crudely done for Disney animation...", "There's no need for details - you know his methods, Watson - but suffice it to say that The Great Mouse Detective's few tunes are unmemorable and all the action (aside from the inventive chase sequences) is snooze-worthy.", "While it is clearly not the most ambitious or flamboyant, it is an engaging 72 minutes worth of fun for kids and easy to take for their chauffeurs.", "\"The Great Mouse Detective\" reflects the energy and enthusiasm of a talented group of young artists stretching their wings for the first time.", "The genuinely witty and endearing disney animation that everyone forgets.", "Of all of [Disney's] properties this would be one that I would say do a sequel.", "Clever Sherlock Holmes tribute mixes wit, peril.", "If the film fails to click on all the emotional levels that Disney might have wanted, at least it's a brightly-paced bit of comedy and fun.", "This is high-quality animation. The engaging characters play out the action against elegantly designed backgrounds.", "Pedestrian Disney cartoon w/nice Vincent Price voice-over.", "As usual with film noir, however, it is the villain who steals the heart and one is rooting for in the breathtaking showdown high up in the cogs and ratchets of Big Ben.", "An amiable little trifle that entertains during its scant running time.", "Not classic, but the start of something good.", "The game is a-paw!", "Small children may be afraid of some of the bad characters -- the Disney Studio's gift for creating really nasty bad guys means that they are scary -- but they will love the cute, brave mice and cheer their triumphs.
