It just sort of lies there, like dumb Lila on the beach, waiting to turn gold.", "[The] 2007 remake delivers a lot of laughs despite the fact we're clearly supposed to root for and feel sorry for the cad ... no matter how squirmy or awful his actions.", "Bobby and Peter Farrelly don't bring any fresh insight or relevance to their remake of The Heartbreak Kid. Mainly, they've taken a decent comedy and turned it into a...decent comedy.", "If you watch this film, don't expect much and you may not be too disappointed. Now there's a ringing endorsement for ya!", "The original's premise has been stripped of anything to do with upward mobility, and except for one shot involving a Prince Albert, the Farrellys' signature shock humor is largely absent.", "It's disappointing to see a comic talent like Ben Stiller slum it in these studio-grade romantic comedies.", "It's like watching the younger brother of There's Something About Mary: it's brash and talks too loud, it's a bit snotty and it so wants to be as cool as its older sibling.", "Beyond its contagious, wacky humour, the film has a very sweet heart", "The elements with which the Farrellys transcend mere gross-out -- pacing, inspired and quirky performances, good writing with an underlying heart -- are missing here, which exposes the underlying creepiness at the heart of the film.", "The cast is pitch perfect, with Stiller adding another notable character to his resum\u00e9.", "Hard-R Farrelly bros. remake offers crude laughs."], "rating": ["6/10", "1.5/4", "", "2/5", "2/10", "", "", "3/10", "C+", "", "2/5", "", "5/10", "1/6", "", "3/5", "", "", "3.5/4", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Micheal Compton", "Ben Kenigsberg", "Jeff Otto", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Fernando F.
