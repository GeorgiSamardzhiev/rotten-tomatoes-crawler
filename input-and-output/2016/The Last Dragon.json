{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Leroy Green (Taimak), a young martial artist living in New York City, trains tirelessly to attain the same level of mastery as the great Bruce Lee. One night, his life changes forever when he rescues television personality Laura Charles (Vanity) from evil businessman Eddie Arkadian (Chris Murney). Impressed by Leroy's bravery, Laura falls for Leroy -- but to keep her safe, he will have to defeat a gang leader named Sho'nuff (Julius J.

It's the truth.", "The charm of The Last Dragon, and key to its lasting potency as a cult object, is how it approaches a conversation about race with humor, even kindness. Its self-deprecation forgives a multitude of sins.", "Taimak and Vanity come to the screen with a great deal of presence and likeability. Schultz brings energy and style to both the fight scenes and the musical moments, mostly staying out of their way and avoiding fast cutting and clunky choreography.", "Michael Schultz tries hard but can't quite manage to tie the varied elements of action, romance, comedy and musical video together, though as entertainment, this is engaging enough.", "An enjoyable pastiche of martial arts, romance, music, and video.", "There aren't many surprises, but the momentum never lets up.", "The Last Dragon is first and foremost a romantic comedy, and a very sweet one at that, and that's why its martial-arts combat scenes work so well. We've been given enough time to care about who's kicking the stuffing out of whom.", "It's slick Motown stuff, shrewdly kept on a brightly colored comic strip level, so that its silly plot and wild swings between dancing feet and flying fists don't seem to matter as much as the attractiveness of the two leads.", "An intoxicating blend of comedy, kung fu, corny romance, special effects and rock videos, it's as electrically sleepless as the New York it's set against.", "Say what you want about it, but I still love it.", "A remake could bring more cohesion to a film with an identity crisis. But it also might not strike the funky, daffy sweet spot in which \"The Last Dragon\" takes an inner-city poke at the hero's journey without ever taking the piss out of it.", "Though the humor in Dragon often falls flat (a Chinese fortune cookie factor is named \"Sum Dum Goy,\" for instance) and the music is hardly memorable, the movie is a real charmer, full of heart and a lot of soul.", "Aka Berry Gordy's The Last Dragon and a sure sign that somewhere along the way the man from Hitsville USA lost it badly.", "", "It's so entertaining that I could almost recommend it -- if it weren't for an idiotic subplot about a gangster and his girlfriend, a diversion that brings the movie to a dead halt every eight or nine minutes.", "It is crammed with kung-fu, singing, rapping, dancing and video art, and no moment goes by without at least three of these things transpiring simultaneously.", "Michael Schultz continues his losing streak as a director with this derivative dud.", "Howlingly goofy artifact from the silliest part of the 1980s."], "rating": ["1/4", "", "", "3/5", "2/5", "2.5/5", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "2/5", "2.5/4", "", "1/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Nusair", "Walter Chaw", "Walter Chaw", "Jeffrey M.
