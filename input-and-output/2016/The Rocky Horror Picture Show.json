The universe is filled with weirdos lost in time, lost in space, but through Rocky Horror perhaps we can find one another.", "For the most part it moves spiritedly along and the whole thing is a giant giggle. It's all so blatantly outrageous it can only be taken in the spirit of campy fun; this is one time a stage production has been enhanced by the film version.", "The music is only adequate, and the acting leaves something to be desired, except in the case of Tim Curry, who manages some fine turns as Dr. Frank N. Furter.", "Famous for its allure as an audience-participation event, this adaptation of the stage musical works just fine as a solo viewing at home, with no resultant diminishment of its highlights.", "a lot of fun for fans of the science fiction and horror genres", "One hundred minutes of pure queer celebration that manages to concoct a bizarre cocktail of sincerity and reckless abandon.", "It's like art-rockers Roxy Music let loose on Frankenstein - ludicrous, but oddly compelling. And it even stars Meat Loaf.", "A great midnight movie experience in the theaters, but the film itself is a bit of a bore.", "", "Like the hugely successful B-Movie that inspired it, Harry Novak's 1965 sexploitation classic \"Kiss Me Quick!\" \"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\" is an exploitation film that draws on a grab-bag of social identifiers to expand on conventional hypocrisies...", "Most of the jokes that might have seemed jolly fun on stage now appear obvious and even flat. The sparkle's gone.", "The film itself is a lot of fun -- but the audience-participation phenomenon has turned it into a one-of-a-kind cinematic experience.", "That celebration of being unique and surreal, whether Gay, straight, or just an oddball, all around.", "", "The wit is too weak to sustain a film, and the songs all sound the same.", "Best seen with wild crowd at midnight.
