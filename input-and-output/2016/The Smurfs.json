{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Evil wizard Gargamel (Hank Azaria) has plagued the happy, peaceful Smurfs for a very long time. Finally, he succeeds in chasing the little blue people from their village and through a magic portal -- which transports them to Manhattan and into the life of ad executive Patrick Winslow (Neil Patrick Harris). Only three apples high and lost in the Big Apple, the Smurfs (Jonathan Winters, Alan Cumming, Katy Perry) must find a way back to their world before Gargamel tracks them down.", "rating": "21", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Animation/Comedy/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Raja Gosnell", "studio": "KernerEntertainment", "theater_date": "Jul 29, 2011", "dvd_date": "Feb 4, 2014", "box_office": "$142.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One can only hope that America ignores this charmless, unimaginative, and downright traumatic trip through 80's children's television.", "\"The Smurfs\" is so smurfing sweet that you'll want to smurfing puke all over the smurfing place.", "A production that seems tremendously difficult to speak of in favorable terms. [Full Review in Spanish]", "If your kid loves this, your kid needs to read a book, or even, heck, play a video game. At least you can tell video game characters apart.", "The Smurfs is a cute family film that suffers from being a little formulaic and uninspired, and the CGI smurfs don't look like the original characters.", "Filmgoers who enjoyed the cartoon (or comic strips) as a kid will very likely be left with the taste of sour Smurfberries.", "The kids might enjoy it, but The Smurfs is nothing but an annoying, noisy commercial for Sony products. Save for Hank Azaria's amusing take on Gargamel, the film is fatty junk food.", "Peyo's much cherished creations do little to nothing for me, and I can't say spending a 102-minutes with them in a live action-computer animated hybrid was all that high on my personal to-do list.", "...a cynical extension, not even an earnest spin-off.", "The Smurf's is a cute film . . . if cute's your thing.", "Once in awhile, a movie sets me searching for its origins. That's what 'The Smurfs' did. I guessed this movie wasn't quite what their creator had in mind - and I was right.", "Call me Grouchy, but I say grown-ups should just say smurf it and avoid the film completely.", "The film indulges in a level of product placement not seen since the glory days of Mac & Me.", "full review at Movies for the Masses", "The Smurfs isn't smurfing awesome, but it's also not a complete pile of smurf.", "It is something of a relief that this energetic kids flick is partially better than it had any right to be.", "The current incarnation of The Smurfs bears little resemblance to the classic cartoon, in a film likely to leave anyone other than hyperactive children feeling blue.", "Takes the 80s favourite kids' cartoon and embellishes it with special effects, New York cliches and gutter humour so that the end result is a shiny but shallow copy of all that was great about the original TV series.", "The Smurfs will likely be the best, most enjoyable kid film of 2011. And, yes, adults have been catered for.
