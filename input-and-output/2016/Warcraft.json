Supported by the fierce fighter Blackhand, Gul'dan organizes the orc clans into a conquering army called the Horde.

[Full review in Spanish]", "In the end, as a non-player of the game I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked the film.", "Sometimes it is vibrant and amazing, sometimes it falls into the conventional, but, I repeat, I put the blame on its blockbuster status and introduction to a saga. [Full Review in Spanish]", "It's hard to tell one growling, sabre-toothed orc apart from another.", "A film that only serves to set up the many sequels that will never get made, Warcraft is all ambition and no execution.", "I'm just not a fan, and there is nothing in it for non-fans. At all. So, oh dear God did I hate this movie. One day, there will be a video game adaptation than unites lovers of the original genre and movie lovers. This is not that day.", "Warcraft has some good moments but mostly it's a huge disappointment.", "All the cool special effects and world building mean nothing if the story doesn't work for this kind of movie.", "The fact that director Duncan Jones has hammered any kind of story out of one of the most popular videogames of all time is impressive, but Warcraft goes one better and manages to be pretty damn entertaining.", "Warcraft is just one more in a long line of less-than-stellar video game movies.", "Somewhere in here is a great movie, but decisions made by who knows who, the story trips and falls.
