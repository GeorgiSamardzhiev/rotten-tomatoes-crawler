{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1999, Internet entrepreneur Josh Harris recruits dozens of young men and women who agree to live in underground apartments for weeks at a time while their every movement is broadcast online. Soon, Harris and his girlfriend embark on their own subterranean adventure, with cameras streaming live footage of their meals, arguments, bedroom activities and bathroom habits. This documentary explores the role of technology in our lives, as it charts the fragile nature of dot-com economy.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Documentary/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Ondi Timoner", "studio": "", "theater_date": "Aug 28, 2009", "dvd_date": "Nov 20, 2016", "box_office": "$41.7K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Disturbing yet fascinating...", "[Ondi] Timoner presents a gripping portrait of a man who is, as so often the case, part genius and part crackpot.", "Ms. Timoner's well-crafted and intelligent film is a cautionary tale about the unthinking way we are living in public now. To use the clich\u00e9 and call it thought-provoking is an understatement.", "We Live in Public is the rare documentary film whose tapping of the American zeitgeist feels downright supernatural.", "Timoner's laudable impulse to chronicle recent history is wasted on insipid overstuffed montages and redundant testimonials, skirting real engagement with the culture in favor of cover-story hooks.", "...an almost disastrously uneven effort that might've been passable as a short but simply doesn't work as a full-length feature.", "There's insight galore amidst this screwball tale, and many a profound implication for the lives we lead today.", "You might not welcome the Panopticon with such open arms, but you can't dispute the fact that Harris saw it all coming long before most people did.", "Josh Harris focuses the lens on himself. You probably have never heard of him. And when the film is over, you may wish you still hadn't.", "A disturbing perspective on what the digital age has done to our individual perceptions of ourselves, but a fascinating study of a man on a mission...or two...", "The big question is whether we're now living in a more pragmatic time.", "A fascinating documentary about a life lived on the cutting edge of technology, and the definitive film about the net's own coming-of-age.", "Mercifully, Harris has now run out of money, but I fear we haven't heard the last of him.", "[Timoner's] film - cobbled together over 15 years - has grown so beguiled by its wonky, disquieting hero that it has lost its distance and mislaid all scepticism.", "What Timoner has done for sure is assemble another documentary of monumental scope. She has a priceless knack for being in the right place at the right time, allied to a filmmaker's instinct for narrative, and a journalistic tenacity.", "The director - who has documented Harris's activities for more than a decade - seems unaware of the irony inherent in making a documentary about a pathological exhibitionist.", "Another bizarre, bewitching tale from those that make up life in, on and around the worldwide web.", "Fascinating, disturbing, thought-provoking, darkly funny and just plain weird.", "A fast-paced, entertaining movie, and it really makes us think.", "We Live in Public is the kind of nonfiction film that seems to have been conceived to prove that truth is stranger than almost any fiction..."], "rating": ["", "4/5", "", "", "", "2/4", "4/5", "7/10", "2.5/4", "4/5", "3/5", "4/5", "2/5", "3/5", "", "2/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Brody", "Nikki Baughan", "Sarah Manvel", "Rob Nelson", "Nicolas Rapold", "David Nusair", "Mike Edwards", "Christopher Long", "Michael O&#39;Sullivan", "David Parkinson", "Dave Calhoun", "Jon Fortgang", "Toby Young", "Xan Brooks", "Matt Bochenski", "Adam Smith", "Nigel Andrews", "Matthew Turner", "Rich Cline", "John Hartl"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Roll Credits", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Critic&#39;s Notebook", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Utne Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Comment Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">What Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Metropolis", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Little White Lies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Financial Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ViewLondon", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Shadows on the Wall", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times"], "date": ["May 4, 2020", "October 25, 2019", "August 9, 2018", "March 12, 2018", "October 20, 2014", "July 22, 2011", "March 1, 2011", "May 1, 2010", "December 11, 2009", "November 13, 2009", "November 13, 2009", "November 13, 2009", "November 13, 2009", "November 13, 2009", "November 13, 2009", "November 13, 2009", "November 13, 2009", "November 13, 2009", "November 13, 2009", "November 12, 2009"]}}
