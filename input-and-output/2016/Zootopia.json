{"metadata": {"synopsis": "From the largest elephant to the smallest shrew, the city of Zootopia is a mammal metropolis where various animals live and thrive. When Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) becomes the first rabbit to join the police force, she quickly learns how tough it is to enforce the law. Determined to prove herself, Judy jumps at the opportunity to solve a mysterious case. Unfortunately, that means working with Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman), a wily fox who makes her job even harder.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Animation/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 48m", "director": "Byron Howard, Rich Moore", "studio": "WaltDisneyAnimationStudios", "theater_date": "Mar 4, 2016", "dvd_date": "Jun 7, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The abundance of humor and action help to mask all the underlying themes that can be construed as far too adult or mature for the family-friendly layout.", "Zootopia is the rare animated Disney film that feels like it was made for adults almost as much as children.", "It's colorful, fun, and has a good message. Will I remember it tomorrow? Probably not, but that doesn't mean I didn't like it today.", "Zootopia is a spectacular achievement on every level. It's a big, bold adventure in a remarkably rendered universe steeped in popular culture, a touching story of unlikely friendship, and a sharp critique of modern society.", "The idea of multiculturalism is not acceptance but tolerance[.]", "Zootopia is your classic reluctant partners buddy cop flick transposed into family-friendly entertainment ... an intelligent animated film that will resonate with children well into their adulthood.", "As entertainment it is a very funny animated film with the fable of Judy, the new heroine of Disney. [Full review in Spanish]", "It was complex in its message and yet clear.", "Totally adorable and cute.", "If you only want to view Zootopia as a cheery little feature cartoon, full of the frolicking anthropomorphic critters Disney excels in creating, it works perfectly well on that level...", "Disney weaves in really important issues interlaced with humor, creativity and fun.", "Zootopia is one of Disney's best films to date and my favorite film of the year so far. It's family friendly and teaches kids so many great life lessons.", "Disney always strove to base his vision of America on the better angels of our nature, and with Zootopia, the company he founded has succeeded.", "There's so much to see, and so many little touches, that those who fall in love with it upon first viewing, and there will be many, will likely come back over and over.", "This is an entertaining piece of original animation and the detail, especially of the animal's hair and fur, is pretty spectacular.", "Fresh, clever and squeal-level funny, Zootopia was just as brilliant on second viewing and no doubt will be for repeat ad nausea.", "Like the best animated movies it mixes social subtext with genuinely hilarious moments and interesting characters.", "A review eviscerating the film would make as much sense as one praising it, so it comes down to a coin-flip judgment call; let's go with the optimistic view that kids hear \"stereotypes and fear of others is bad\" and adults reinforce that message.", "\"Zootopia\" includes all the elements of a well-rounded, memorable story that strikes a range of emotional chords.
