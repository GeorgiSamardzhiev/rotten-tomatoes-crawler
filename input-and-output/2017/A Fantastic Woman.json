This is a story of relationships, of grief, and of how social networks break down for the most vulnerable.", "Beautiful and inspired, optimistic but raw, a fantastic approach to transsexual femininity as part of a daily life cycle.

And it's all thanks to Vega's transcendent performance.", "[It] is a film well worth the time seek out and watch, for its wonderful lead performance and its portrayal of quiet human dignity and persistence in the face of prejudice.", "Vega's performance is riveting, but writer and co-director Sebasti\u00e1n Leilo's use of sex and gender to shape his narrative is straight out of a '50s melodrama.", "A Fantastic Woman represents a bold step forward, but also stands alone as a great, always relevant study of resilience in the face of a thoughtless and cowardly world.", "The screenwriters, Lelio and Gonzalo Maza, created a mysterious, opaque fog around the core of the story that simply didn't work."], "rating": ["4/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "5/5", "3.5/5", "4.5/5", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "3.5/4", "", "5/5", "", "4/5", "2.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Matt Cipolla", "David Lamble", "J.
