When Jennifer stops using birth control and doesn't tell Danny, it puts a strain on their relationship, particularly after she discovers that they have fertility problems. Soon both Danny and Jennifer are tempted to stray from their marriage as their baby conception woes mount.", "rating": "6", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Keith Samples", "studio": "ParamountPictures,RysherEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 15, 2016", "box_office": "$3.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's the cinematic equivalent of having a saccharine-coated tongue depressor jammed down your throat.", "Keith Sample's film aspires to the innocent charm of a newlywed comedy like Barefoot in the Park, but gets bogged down in witless sex jokes.", "The adorable Kinnear is not doing himself any favors with overblown sit-coms like this.", "A Smile Like Yours makes no one smile or cry, just wince. The script is unwieldy, and Kinnear and Holly stuggle in every frame to make characters likable.", "After a while, I could smell the jokes coming like Grandma's two-day-old stuffed cabbage.", "This may not be the worst romantic comedy of the year, but surely it's the flattest. The thing has no energy. It just lies there, waiting to be kicked.", "On paper, infertility would seem a distasteful subject matter for light comedy. On screen, it only gets worse.", "Kooky Joan Cusack can't provide sufficient comic relief in this incredibly naive attempt at schmaltz.", "It's as compelling as a car commercial, as deep as a diaper pail.", "The brief Lucy scene was funnier than anything else in the movie. If only the clip had lasted longer.", "The direction is unfocused and the end result is patchy.", "This astonishingly inept romantic comedy ignores the most basic rules of character development, and demands that the Robertsons do and think things so stupid and venal that it's the next best thing to impossible to like or care about them.", "One ghastly limp noodle of a movie.", "An uncommonly thoughtful and intelligent mainstream entertainment, painstaking and stylish in every aspect.", "Flat and formulaic, this painfully charmless romantic comedy is destined to disappear quickly after its halfhearted theatrical release.", "", "", "", "With the exception of Joan Cusack, who really needs a movie of her own -- and must stop playing best friends, wives and secretaries of main characters -- this is a waste of seven bucks.", "We're so bored with these two we wouldn't care if they never shared a cab, much less a family.
