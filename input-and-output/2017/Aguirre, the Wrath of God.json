{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Don Lope de Aguirre (Klaus Kinski), a ruthless Spanish conquistador, vies for power while part of an expedition in Peru to find El Dorado, the mythical seven cities of gold. Accompanied by his daughter, Flores (Cecilia Rivera), Aguirre faces off against his superior, Don Pedro de Ursua (Ruy Guerra), and grows increasingly volatile after seizing control of the group.

Herzog does it because it is ingrained in his very being.", "...an irrelevant and sporadically interminable piece of work.", "Aguirre is a compelling piece of historical fiction that lingers in the memory largely because of its lush, claustrophobic atmosphere and the towering presence of Kinski.", "His Spanish conquistadors were no match for the natural splendor and terror of the Amazon, but Herzog was, and he conquered cinema.", "Aguirre, The Wrath of God is not just about a group of fifteenth-century explorers but is a poignant reflection of the world we still live in.", "\"Aguirre, The Wrath of God\" leaves you feeling as if you are watching a documentary rather than a fictionalized drama. In some ways, what you are seeing is nothing short of the absolute truth.", "Idiosyncratic visionaries don't come any more idiosyncratic or visionary than Werner Herzog.", "Herzog's riveting Brechtian epic about a catastrophic expedition across the Andes and down the Amazon in 1560 is arguably his best work ...", "The whole movie merges landscapes and character with such force that, once seen, you never forget it.", "Herzog's vision of man disregarding nature and bringing about his inevitable demise is an intoxicating one, and one that demands to be revisited through this wonderfully restored print.", "It looks more magnificent and mad than ever, one of the great folies de grandeur of 1970s cinema, an expeditionary Conradian nightmare like Coppola's Apocalypse Now.", "A journey down river to the mouth of Hell, but also so much more.", "Made for buttons, it's an awesome feat of filmmaking.", "A classic that screams to be seen on the big screen.", "Ramshackle chaos and insanity.", "A visionary work, Aguirre is one of Herzog's greatest achievements.", "An essential hallucination, subsequently mined by Coppola, Weir and Malick but unsurpassed in its vision of the withering yet liberating madness beneath our armor", "This 1972 German film eschews narrative for hallucinatory images and long takes that plunge you into the whirlpool of the main character's madness. It's less storytelling than a visually disturbing fever dream.", "The acting is properly larger than life, especially Klaus Kinski as the title character, a lean, driven but imposing man who has heads lopped off when in any way interfered with in his task of destruction and exploration."], "rating": ["9/10", "", "1.5/4", "3/4", "", "1", "4/4", "4.5/5", "", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "", "A", "", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Allen Almachar", "David Nusair", "James Berardinelli", "Pat Padua", "Josh Cabrita", "David Keyes", "Ken Hanke", "Philip French", "Derek Malcolm", "Joe Cunningham", "Peter Bradshaw", "David Jenkins", "Cath Clarke", "Tom Dawson", "John Bleasdale", "Emanuel Levy", "Fernando F.
