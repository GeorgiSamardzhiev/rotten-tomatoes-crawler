But there is a thanatonic rapture to its vision of a whole world ending and being reborn as something else.", "I've seen the movie four times, and this go-around my jaw was lower on the floor than ever before, somehow.", "It's dark and violent but, because it is so creative, it is a really fun experience. It's like Inception but way more trippy!", "It continues to show the best of the genre, almost 30 years later. It would be sacrilegious to give a different rating from PERFECT to AKIRA. [Full review in Spanish]", "Handsome and preposterously ambitious, and even its worst narrative missteps are a factor of that ambition.", "While its typically convoluted sci-fi plotting and sprawling ensemble of characters occasionally lead it to border on the incoherent, it's hard not to be in awe of the giant hand-drawn cityscapes that make up the backdrop for the eye-popping action.", "Pounding away, it becomes monotonous.", "[Akira] is a blast and a half, a twisted dystopian parable of violence and rock and roll, Japanese-style. It's Disney on PCP, mean, rotten, psychotic, but incredibly vivid.", "Extremely violent classic introduced anime to Westerners.", "Moments that can only be captured as animation make Akira still worth watching: gusts of wind from chopper blades, ka-tooming bursts of fiery explosions, Tetsuo's visions.", "Plenty of superb recent blockbusters, including The Matrix, The Dark Knight, Minority Report, Dark City and Inception, are all in its debt - not to mention a fair number of shockers, like Star Wars Episode II and the most recent Resident Evil atrocity.", "Put it up there with the most astonishing animated features ever made.", "Style and substance run neck and neck in this thrilling, bold landmark film that just refuses to become dated.", "The cityscapes are awesome, the camerawork is dizzying. If you're new to manga, prepare to be converted.", "Akira is pure concentrated cinematic excellence - accept no substitutes.", "When you absolutely, positively have to get some anime in your life, accept no substitutes; 23 years on, Akira is still the genre's crowning achievement.", "Like Snow White before it, Akira was a step change in what animation could show.", "The movie, even at 124 minutes, has the densely packed sweep and go-for-it pep of a pop epic.", "Un film qui plaira autant aux fans du genre manga qu'\u00e0 ses d\u00e9tracteurs."], "rating": ["A", "4/5", "", "9.5/10", "5/5", "8/10", "4/5", "2/4", "3/4", "4/5", "", "5/5", "4/5", "5/5", "4/5", "5/5", "5/5", "4.5/5", "", "8/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Chris Stuckmann", "Peter Bradshaw", "Matt Patches", "Rachel Wagner", "Julio V\u00e9lez", "Tim Brayton", "David Jenkins", "Dave Kehr", "Stephen Hunter", "Jeffrey M.
