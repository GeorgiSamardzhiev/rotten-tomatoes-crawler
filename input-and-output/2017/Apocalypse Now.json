{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In Vietnam in 1970, Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) takes a perilous and increasingly hallucinatory journey upriver to find and terminate Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), a once-promising officer who has reportedly gone completely mad.

[Full Review in Spanish]", "Although Apocalypse Now is not a great movie, it shows a still-impressive, politically inspired ambition -- a reminder of why film culture matters... Mixing pessimism with astonishment, it expanded cultural unease on a grand 70mm scale.", "It has coherence, truthfulness, and conviction-up to a point.", "The film holds together well enough until it reaches its final muddle, and it has scenes and moments unequaled in recent European or American movies.", "Coppola says he wanted to get to the moral issues that are behind all wars, but I think he has done no more than demonstrate the obvious-that in Vietnam we fought a bad war.", "as Captain Willard (Martin Sheen) heads up river to assassinate Kurtz, his increasing admiration for the man is offset by his disgust at the scenes of more authorised insanity (and hypocrisy) all around.", "Good or bad, success or failure, this is a magnificent, gonzo piece of cinema, and the art form would be far lesser if it had never existed.", "An indelible statement on the lunacy of war.", "Coppola's vivid-as-an-LSD-trip take on the madness of war is a one of a kind film, a mess-terpiece held together by sheer audacity and imagination.", "It's the cumulative effect generated by mixing richly portentous imagery with absurdly portentous prose, starkly portentous sound and flatulently portentous music.", "Certainly, no movie in history has ever presented stronger proof that war is living hell.", "I'm revisiting and 'REDUX-ing' one of our five star film entries, to ensure that it is paid the dues it deserves.
