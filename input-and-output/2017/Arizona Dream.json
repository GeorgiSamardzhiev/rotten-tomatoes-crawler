Much is made of dreams that, either spoken of at length or illustrated, are offered in lieu of character development.", "The first 'American' film by the director of Time of the Gypsies is every bit as bizarre and imaginative as his earlier work, although it's also maddeningly indulgent and erratic.", "A trule bizarre, surreal fable, flaunting yet another eccentric performance from the very young and handsome Johnny Depp; Faye Dunaway, as his love interest, and Lili Tomlin are also good.", "", "David Lynch, you've got a target on your back.
