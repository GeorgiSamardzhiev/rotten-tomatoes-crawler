{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This thoughtful and unique French film reveals the surprisingly deep connection between Marie (Anne Wiazemsky), a sensitive farm girl, and her cherished donkey, Balthazar. Though Marie and Balthazar are eventually separated when she gets older, the tale follows both the young woman and the donkey as they contend with the hardships of the world. Although Marie and Balthazar often encounter cruelty from the various people they meet, they also find small moments of beauty.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Robert Bresson", "studio": "ParcFilm,SvenskaFilminstitutet,SvenskFilmindustri(SF)AB,ArgosFilms,AthosFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 25, 2017", "box_office": "$39.4K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The movie plays like a concerto.", "I don't know if Au Hasard Balthazar is a masterpiece. I don't even know what it is exactly, aside from a rare and fascinating object. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Bresson slowly transmits that it is Balthazar's example of loyalty, sustenance and grace that is noble and permanent - not the transient agendas of the people around him.", "I think this is a superb movie for its original content, exhilarating editing and Bresson's Puritanistic camera work, belt-high and wonderfully toned, that creates a deep, damp, weathered quality of centuries-old provincialism.", "If one were looking for a perfectly realized film, Au Hasard Balthazar would be as likely a candidate as any.", "A film that despite its obvious religious overtones is much more about the hell of relationships based on commodities rather than sin.", "One of the great masterpieces of world cinema: austere, warm, grim, surreal, shocking and heartbreaking.", "The antithesis of cute Disney films about animals, Au Hasard, Balthazar is a stark meditation on existence in which meaning is conveyed through images and sounds, culminating in a moment of sublime epiphany.", "With Bresson, patience is rewarding, and not just because Balthazar has an ending both strangely beautiful and profoundly sad. It's worth the effort to connect to this singular vision, one that's austere and humane in equal measure.", "The film could have sunk beneath this symbolic burden, yet it is lightened by the speed and precision of Bresson's art; he could derive more from one pair of hands than most directors can from two hours of blood and guts.", "Very much deserves its art-house cred.", "If you can see past the heavy-handed religious overtones you will encounter an inspired and deeply intelligent Bresson classic.", "Perhaps the greatest and most revolutionary of Bresson's films, Balthazar is a difficult but transcendently rewarding experience, never to be missed.", "It's a cinematic experience that deserves to be discover for those who want more than what they are told to watch.", "The film does maintain a powerful mood throughout, a kind of stringency, and the fate of the humans fades into insignificance as the film draws to a bleak close.", "No film I have ever seen has come so close to convulsing my entire being as has Au Hasard Balthazar.", "It's a study of human weakness and cruelty, it's a portrait of Christ the suffering servant, it's the heartbreaking story of a young girl's descent from innocence to despair. But above all, it's a movie about a donkey.", "The film is perhaps the director's most perfectly realised, and certainly his most moving.", "Bresson's greatest masterpiece.", "A deft, impassioned, and wrenching film, but also - emphatically, absurdly - a film about a donkey. Indeed, it hardly pretends to be much more."], "rating": ["", "", "5/5", "", "A", "", "5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "", "4.5/5", "5/5", "", "5/5", "", "", "4/4", "", "A+", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Leah Pickett", "Fernando Trueba", "PJ Nabarro", "Manny Farber", "Ignatiy Vishnevetsky", "Louis Proyect", "Adrian Turner", "", "Richard C.
