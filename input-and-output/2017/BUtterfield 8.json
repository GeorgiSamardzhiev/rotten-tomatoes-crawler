Let's say O'Harrowing. And the ending is absurd. But so is most of it for that matter. It's the living it up that gets you in this film.", "", "Taylor's heralded performance as the archetypal hooker ('the slut of all time!') with a heart of gold is a bit overrated.", "Even when shrieking, Liz is irresistible.
