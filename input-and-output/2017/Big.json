{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After a wish turns 12-year-old Josh Baskin (David Moscow) into a 30-year-old man (Tom Hanks), he heads to New York City and gets a low-level job at MacMillen Toy Company. A chance encounter with the owner (Robert Loggia) of the company leads to a promotion testing new toys. Soon a fellow employee, Susan Lawrence (Elizabeth Perkins), takes a romantic interest in Josh. However, the pressure of living as an adult begins to overwhelm him, and he longs to return to his simple, former life as a boy.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Comedy/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Penny Marshall", "studio": "20thCenturyFox,GracieFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 21, 2014", "box_office": "$113.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Director Penny Marshall doesn't hammer any themes or satire into the film; she, quite shrewdly, keeps Big likeably small. The comedy is natural and unforced, in no small part because of Hanks' wonderfully slapstick performance.", "Oh, this movie. It's not sad, but it makes me tear up every single time without fail. It's delightfully 80s and Tom Hanks is an adorable heartbreaker.", "What makes this all work, of course, is Hanks himself, who brings remarkable authenticity and simplicity to the role. He makes being a kid seem as wonderful as it was, and as scary and as confusing too.", "Hanks, as a stranger in a strange land, gives us equal portions of laughs and insights into the worlds of both adults and adolescents. Big also offers up a very funny satire of corporate ladder climbing.", "The film succeeds largely because of the splendid performance of Tom Hanks -- who is irresistibly funny as \"big\" Josh.", "Tom Hanks is marvellously child-like as Josh, all restless energy, innocence and real pleasure in the liberation that being grown-up allows him.", "Big may well be a formula fantasy movie, but Penny Marshall's polished direction combined with Hanks's gauche charm make it the best of the spate of body-swap movies turned out by Hollywood in the late 1980s.", "Joyously entertaining, escapist stuff.", "A disarmingly sweet movie.", "...an agreeable yet unremarkable piece of work.", "A funny, bittersweet film that opens as a cautionary tale about growing up too fast, but deepens into a movie about the unplumbable gulf between childhood and adulthood.", "A delightful comedy-fantasy.", "There's also one absolutely charming moment when Hanks and Loggia leap from key to key to tap out the melody and harmony to \"Heart and Soul\" on a giant piano in the F.A.O. Schwarz toy store.", "Penny Marshall brings a logic to the premise that is sustained through most of the movie. And where the other movies snickered at the sexual possibilities in the idea, she faces up to them with both candor and taste.", "An otherwise-hackneyed story of personality transmigration takes on new meaning -- accompanied by plenty of laughs -- all because of the film`s gregarious and clever star, Tom Hanks.", "This setup isn't exactly what you'd call plausible, but the follow-through is consistent and clever.", "Big, which has been directed by Penny Marshall with verve and impeccable judgment, drops a child's innocence into the corporate rat race as if it were a depth charge.", "When Marshall brings Hanks and Perkins together, she discovers a grace and lightness in their relationship that transcends the pinched thematics of the script.", "Not a major movie but a pleasing one.", "One of the best comedies about body-switching, Big is charming and occasioally witty with a splendid, star-making performance by Tom Hanks."], "rating": ["", "", "", "A-", "3.5/4", "3/5", "4/5", "4/5", "3/4", "2.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "3/4", "3/4", "B+"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Duane Byrge", "Lindsay Pugh", "Cathy Burke", "James Plath", "Kathleen Carroll", "Victoria Mather", "Peter Freedman", "", "Matt Brunson", "David Nusair", "Keith Phipps", "Gerald Clarke", "Ben Yagoda", "Desmond Ryan", "Roger Hurlburt", "Jay Boyar", "Kevin Thomas", "Dave Kehr", "Gene Siskel", "Emanuel Levy"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Woman in Revolt", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">United Press International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Family Home Theater", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dissolve", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com"], "date": ["December 26, 2018", "October 24, 2018", "August 23, 2016", "April 3, 2016", "July 28, 2015", "December 25, 2014", "August 11, 2014", "August 11, 2014", "April 18, 2014", "December 29, 2013", "December 16, 2013", "August 2, 2013", "August 2, 2013", "August 2, 2013", "August 2, 2013", "August 2, 2013", "July 29, 2013", "July 29, 2013", "January 16, 2013", "August 6, 2011"]}}
