{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The film takes place in 1993 when the U.S. sent special forces into Somalia to destabilize the government and bring food and humanitarian aid to the starving population. Using Black Hawk helicopters to lower the soldiers onto the ground, an unexpected attack by Somalian forces brings two of the helicopters down immediately. From there, the U.S. soldiers must struggle to regain their balance while enduring heavy gunfire.", "rating": "76", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "2h 24m", "director": "Ridley Scott", "studio": "ColumbiaPicturesCorporation,JerryBruckheimerFilms,RevolutionStudios,ScottFreeProductions", "theater_date": "Jan 18, 2002", "dvd_date": "Mar 10, 2016", "box_office": "$108.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Not nearly as potent as one might expect from this particular director, especially with a sizable budget and resources at his disposal, and governing this impressive cast.", "Scott pares back story, character development and moral righteousness to their bare essentials, resulting in the most striking, if not revealing, portrait of modern warfare ever filmed.", "The nobility and inspiration are in the action. It is in that sense a film very much in tune with America's mood: practical, resolute, fierce.", "I also don't know how well this 2001 drama represents the events of October 3 and 4, 1993, though I can see that it represents them in a realist vein, referring to other war movies without becoming frivolous.", "Black Hawk Down makes that point without preachment, in precise and pitiless imagery. And for that reason alone it takes its place on the very short list of the unforgettable movies about war and its ineradicable and immeasurable costs.", "It looks fantastic, not least because it boasts helicopter scenes to rival those of Apocalypse Now.", "Violent depiction of a risky rescue; adults only.", "No film from the Zeroes - hell, maybe ever - more forcefully imparted the horrors of war as thoroughly, coherently and hauntingly. Even justified wars run rampant with monstrosities, and this showed just how critical camaraderie can be in conquering them.", "Black Hawk Down\" is a precise vision of how little war has changed in spite of America's high-tech equipment and extensive vocabulary of modern tactics.", "A relentless immersion in combat strikingly realized but none too pleasurable to sit through.", "While fine films like Saving Private Ryan depict warfare at its worst, they do not depict warfare in modernity. I cannot imagine a better representation of war, with all of its urban complexities, than Black Hawk Down.", "Action masters Ridley Scott and Jerry Bruckheimer prove that it is possible to extend the opening twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan to two full hours. Now all they have to do is spend some of that time creating characters to care about.", "It would've been nice to get to know a few of the men we're meant to care about.", "Ambitious, sumptuously-framed and frenetic, Black Hawk Down occasionally errs on the confused, but is nonetheless a rare find of a war movie which dares to turn genre convention on its head.", "[Scott] does a reasonable job sketching the complicated and contradictory political context, but attempts to bring in the odd Somali perspective are grossly inadequate.", "Though visually awesome in its gritty portrayal of combat, the film is marred by lack of coherent or engaging story and distinguishable characters to anchor the tale.", "'Black Hawk Down' jerks you around, slaps the side of your head, and kicks your butt back up to keep moving on. [Published 1-26-02]", "War is inevitable, and often gruesome, but it also turns brave soldiers into heroes.", "One helluva war film.", "It's a rather shrewd move to not develop the characters beyond the most limited degree; the cold, wasteful machine-like quality to the destruction comes across all the better without forced melodrama."], "rating": ["7/10", "4.5/5", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "4/4", "B-", "", "8/10", "3/4", "3/5", "3/5", "", "B+", "A", "3/4", "3/4", "4.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Leigh Paatsch", "Mark Steyn", "Lisa Alspector", "Richard Schickel", "", "Kelly Kessler", "Nick Rogers", "Cole Smithey", "Todd McCarthy", "Brandon Fibbs", "Joe Lozito", "Rob Gonsalves", "Mark Dinning", "", "Emanuel Levy", "Steve Crum", "Judith Egerton", "Emily Blunt", "Michael Dequina"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Yap", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">BrandonFibbs.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Big Picture Big Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Kansas City Kansan", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Courier-Journal (Louisville, KY)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Blunt Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat"], "date": ["September 25, 2020", "July 13, 2020", "June 18, 2012", "November 8, 2011", "November 8, 2011", "November 8, 2011", "January 2, 2011", "September 25, 2010", "August 23, 2009", "January 2, 2009", "February 28, 2008", "December 27, 2007", "July 23, 2007", "December 30, 2006", "June 24, 2006", "April 26, 2006", "December 11, 2005", "June 23, 2004", "March 7, 2004", "January 12, 2004"]}}
