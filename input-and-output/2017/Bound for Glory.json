{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The Dust Bowl overtakes his native Oklahoma in the early 1930s, and struggling young musician Woody Guthrie (David Carradine) leaves his wife, Mary (Melinda Dillon), to join the great westward migration to southern California. When he meets singer and union agitator Ozark Bule (Ronny Cox), Guthrie finds his populist political voice -- but at the expense of his personal life. Director Hal Ashby adapted this biopic from Guthrie's 1943 autobiography of the same title.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 27m", "director": "Hal Ashby", "studio": "UnitedArtists", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 29, 2000", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["While certainly not as boldly original as his prior work on Harold and Maude or The Last Detail, with his big budget Hollywood biopic, Ashby crafted a period perfect film that really rides on Carradine's salt of the earth performance.", "A hauntingly beautiful, socio-political film.", "There are images in Hal Ashby's Bound For Glory so striking or so beautiful I doubt I'll ever forget them... The film has a grave dignity, which is good, but it often seems to lack life, which would be better.", "The role was earmarked for Dustin Hoffman, Jack Nicholson and Robert De Niro (among others), but it's hard to imagine even these accomplished thespians matching the sly insouciance or devil-may-care charm which Carradine makes indispensable to the part.", "It's a story that's truly worth telling, but should have been pruned by 30 minutes and it wouldn't have lost a thing artistically.", "One half of a very good movie.", "A moving, brilliantly photographed picture that portrays the legendary eccentric folksinger Woody Guthrie in a trip across Depression-era America.", "Bound for Glory is outstanding biographical cinema, not only of the late Woody Guthrie but also of the 1930s Depression era which served to disillusion, inspire and radicalize him and millions of other Americans.", "Though made with an eye for the Bicentennial, this biopic of folk singer and union organizer Woody Guthrie didn't make any attempt to speak to contemporary viewers, which might explain its box-office failure.", "An overlong, sentimental and lifeless biopic of Woody Guthrie.", "", "", "", "", "", "Hope you like folk music, because there isn't much variety to be found among his music.
