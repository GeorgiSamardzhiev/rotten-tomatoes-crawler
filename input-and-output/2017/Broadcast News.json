{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Intelligent satire of American television news. A highly strung news producer finds herself strangely attracted to a vapid anchorman even through she loathes everything he personifies. To make matters worse, her best friend, a talented but not particularly telegenic news reporter, is secretly in love with her.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 12m", "director": "James L.

[Full Review in Spanish]", "Hunter shows us a woman who was never able to pretend she wasn't smarter than the guys, and gives a performance of such springy naturalness that it hardly seems like a performance at all.", "Albert Brooks and Holly Hunter perform with such vitality, such comic neuroticism, that they at least blur the edges of their stereotypes.", "Broadcast News is a slick and well- scripted comedy, witty and well-paced; it makes no points that haven't been made before, but like its TV news team it makes them entertainingly.", "It's an intelligent, uproariously funny dissection of what really goes on in a TV newsroom, both on and off camera.", "The film has savvy and it has an edge, but there s not a trace of cruelty or cheap-shot, easy humor in it. Much of it, in fact, is startlingly warm and heartfelt. This is important; it's what makes this movie so easy to watch.", "As the talented but professionally thwarted news writer, Brooks is sensational, both vain and vulnerable.", "Jane Craig is a feminist heroine in a way that few female romantic-comedy protagonists since have been, even the ones we consider strong and independent.", "James Brooks is too gifted a writer for that simple a story.", "This bittersweet love story is set against the world of network news and writer-producer-director James Brooks fills his satire with some lovable heros and villains -- and characters that don't quite fit into either category.", "(The) endlessly quotable writing... keeps the film fresh as Tom, Aaron and Jane carom off each other at ever-more oblique angles.", "The human element is just as prescient as it was then, while the characters' romantic/professional entanglements now have the added poignancy of the past tense.", "By looking at the small-screen picture...[Brooks] provocatively suggests that America's socio-political problems are pretty much the same as the personal problems of its citizens. [Blu-ray]", "People often behave foolishly in matters of love and just about everything else. That can lead to heartache and tragedy, but that same foolishness can also be very funny to watch, as it is here.", "All the performers are tops.", "The outstanding set pieces give the viewer an idea of the job pressures, its perks, pitfalls and how the news is in the long run compromised.", "Enormously entertaining.", "In a film tracing the endless battles between style and substance, Brooks delivers both in abundance.", "Hunter and Brooks are hugely appealing as news professionals trying to stay afloat in the corporate cauldron."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "4/4", "4/4", "", "", "4/4", "", "7/10", "4/4", "3.5/4", "A", "", "B+", "", "5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Chris Plante", "\u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez-Santos", "Molly Haskell", "Sean French", "Hilary Mantel", "Richard Freedman", "Joe Baltake", "Duane Byrge", "Jen Chaney", "Gene Siskel", "Cathy Burke", "Christopher Long", "James Kendrick", "Peter Canavese", "Robert Roten", "Richard Corliss", "Dennis Schwartz", "Variety Staff", "", "Film4 Staff"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Polygon", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Vogue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sight and Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newhouse News Service", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">McClatchy News Service", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Magazine/Vulture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">United Press International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Metropolis", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Q Network Film Desk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Groucho Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Laramie Movie Scope", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4"], "date": ["December 1, 2020", "April 10, 2020", "February 27, 2020", "January 28, 2020", "March 1, 2019", "March 1, 2019", "February 22, 2019", "December 18, 2018", "December 19, 2017", "August 23, 2017", "November 8, 2016", "February 26, 2011", "February 6, 2011", "January 17, 2011", "February 24, 2010", "February 2, 2009", "April 2, 2008", "April 1, 2008", "April 1, 2008", "April 1, 2008"]}}
