If it is not the worst film I have ever seen, that makes it all the more shameful: People with talent allowed themselves to participate in this travesty.", "It ended up almost as infamous and notorious as its subject... and that's not a compliment.", "I suppose certain college fraternities could make screening it part of their hazing rituals.", "Simply a curiosity, a laughable relic of a failed effort to bring explicit sex movies to the masses.", "Despite the movie, the highlight of this three-disc set is the often hilarious commentary.", "Excess for excess sake, or just bad taste: Caligula is a messy, bloody film that fails on any level, even as porn and camp.", "All in all it's a dreary shambles.", "", "", "Direo de arte e figurinos corretos; atuaes intensas e uma direo corajosa.
