He soon meets Oliver, a handsome doctoral student who's working as an intern for Elio's father. Amid the sun-drenched splendor of their surroundings, Elio and Oliver discover the heady beauty of awakening desire over the course of a summer that will alter their lives forever.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 12m", "director": "Luca Guadagnino", "studio": "RTFeatures,LaCin\u00e9facture,FrenesyFilm", "theater_date": "Jan 19, 2018", "dvd_date": "Feb 23, 2018", "box_office": "$18.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Chalamet is quickly becoming one of the most reliable young actors around...", "The actors are superbly convincing.", "It's certainly a handsome piece of escapist-touristic fantasy, though I remain skeptical of Guadagnino, who often seems truer to his sideline as a luxury-product advertiser than he does to the narrative and psychological depth...", "One of 2017's most engaging and loving films.", "[I]ncredibly seedy and oft-fetishized . . . In the world of Call Me by Your Name, this sort of behavior is literal, and it's abusive.", "Chalamet's performance is subtle but thorough, his body language conveys so many feelings... his stare is the reflection of the love he desires. [Full review in Spanish]", "[T]here is nothing else in their world of two, no other possible reference ... The film is powerful not in spite of the fact that it's a summer fling, but because of it.", "It frames the honesty of human feelings with a lucidity that transcends any sexual sphere. It is a good movie. [Full review in Spanish]", "Call Me by Your Name transcends because it dares to not only ask, but also answer the question posed by so many love stories throughout history: was the love worth the pain? Yes. Without a doubt, it was.", "A delicious boy-meets-boy romance.", "The director's use of location is almost too good to be true, and will likely make you want to book at trip to Italy immediately.", "I still enjoyed a lot of this movie.", "There wasn't nearly enough Italy porn or gay porn.", "A modern-day Visconti, Italian director Luca Guadagnino (I Am Love) grants us entry into a world not only of wealth but of culture, which can be just as liberating.", "Call Me By Your Name is one of the most beautiful films I saw in 2017, but ultimately it left me unsettled.", "The movie contributes little to the urgent contemporary project of diversifying representation... Yet, for two hours and change, Call Me By Your Name is an overwhelmingly pleasant and seductive place to live.", "The film (adapted by James Ivory) is beyond lovely and methodical, covering every aspect of the life of an adolescent at a critical moment of his growth.", "Guadagnino has absorbed some of that Merchant Ivory mojo, with its sotto vocce emotions and divine European languor. But he's also fallen victim to his inspiration's vices as well.", "A timeless and sumptuous tale of the rarity and fullness of love.", "At its heart, Call Me By Your Name is bittersweet, melancholic yet ultimately uplifting - just like first love."], "rating": ["", "6/10", "", "3.0/4", "", "", "", "7/10", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Bax", "Mike Massie", "Dennis Harvey", "Richard Propes", "Matt Cipolla", "Ricardo Gallegos", "CJ Sheu", "Yasser Medina", "Alton Williams", "David Lamble", "Steven Prokopy", "Avaryl Halley", "Andrew Galdi", "J.
