{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Dr. John Carpenter (Elvis Presley) takes the job of running a health center in a low-income district. He enlists three women to help out who -- unbeknownst to him -- are actually nuns in street clothes.

Unaware of her unavailability, John falls for Sister Michelle (Mary Tyler Moore), serenading her with his guitar -- which, luckily for him, effectively wears away at her religious resolve.", "rating": "10", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "William Graham", "studio": "Universal/UniversalInt", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["", "", "Atrociously conceived, but strangely very watchable.", "", "", "", "", "Maybe the studio brass thought it would be hit; viewed now, it looks like a desperate reach, a blind attempt to do anything to connect with the audience.", "", "A well-meaning attempt to channel the spirit of the 60s counterculture."], "rating": ["2/5", "2/5", "2/5", "1/5", "5", "2/4", "2/5", "1.5/4", "1/5", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Emanuel Levy", "Daniel M.
