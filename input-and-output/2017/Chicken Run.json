{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This engaging stop-motion, claymation adventure tells the story of an American rooster who falls in love with a gorgeous hen on a British farm. The couple decides to run away from the farm, but they must first contend with the evil farmer who is intent on keeping them under her control. The chickens decide to attempt an escape so they don't get turned into chicken pot pies.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Animation/Comedy/Drama/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 25m", "director": "Peter Lord, Nick Park", "studio": "DreamWorksPictures,Path\u00e9Pictures,AardmanAnimations,AlliedFilmmakers", "theater_date": "Jun 21, 2000", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["So great.", "Its plump chickens maintain that strange, haptic quality that makes you yearn to reach out and squeeze them.", "Even without Wallace and Gromit, most of the trademark joys are here: the compound of squashy creatures and heavy machinery, the wide, open-ended rictus of a toothy smile, and the great Parkian gulp.", "It coaxes you to laugh and cry, flatters your intelligence, and practically guarantees a cheap night out: at dinner afterward, no one's going to be ordering anything but salad.", "It's a warm-hearted and amusing entertainment that your children will enjoy.", "Chickens are inherently funny, like nature's idea of a very practical joke. Park and Lord have just improved the old rubber chicken gag, making it movable, turning it into something closer to who we are and what we know as humans.", "Chicken Run is a charmingly conceived entertainment. But it's a little bit twee.", "What gives this movie its oddly strong grip on a viewer's heart is a physical tenderness inseparable from the nature of claymation.", "The claymation comedy Chicken Run is eggsactly what the doctor ordered. It's a witty, high-spirited adventure that will appeal to moviegoers of all ages. Call it chicken soup for the funny bone.", "The first feature film from England's Aardman Animation, and the first truly terrific film to be released by DreamWorks.", "Most of the time Chicken Run entertains, instructs, involves and enchants.", "Run to Chicken Run. This clay-animation comedy is the most entertaining animal story since Babe.", "The film is brilliantly voiced across the board, with special notice to Mel Gibson as Rocky and Julia Sawalha as Ginger.", "The sly, sardonic flight of fancy known as Chicken Run is a delightful epic of fowl deeds, quests for freedom and poultry heroics from the off-kilter English cartoon house, Aardman Animation.", "Like Wallace & Gromit, it's a paean to British eccentricity, equal parts cluelessness and hopefulness, full of English slang and dry Brit humor.", "Indeed, it's the best movie comedy to come out of England since Monty Python packed up the circus.", "Chicken Run contains some gorgeous, destined-to-be-classic set pieces, and this is where the Aardman production team flex their animation muscles.", "It's nothing less than a stop-motion tour de force, bursting with charm, humor, invention and eye-popping mise en scene.", "With its winking homages to films like Stalag 17 and The Great Escape, Run is visually inventive, its characters plump with personality and, for a bunch of chickens, ever so brave.", "This wonderful visual treat is done in stop-action clay animation, a form which is both substantial and magical.
