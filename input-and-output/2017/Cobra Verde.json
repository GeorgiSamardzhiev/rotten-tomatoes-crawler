His strength lies in capturing lucid lunacy on film, and Manoel da Silva's descent into the jaws of madness is a straight shot into the heart of darkness.", "The final third of this film contains sequences of horrifying sublimity and ethereal beauty, moments that have a clarity and power beyond the reach of reason.", "Verde is too blankly amoral to sustain interest, but the film has isolated moments of haunting poetry.", "It's easy to understand why this was Herzog's final collaboration with the actor, but Kinski's performance nevertheless serves up a potent confusion of documentary and fiction that has long been an essential element of Herzog's filmmaking.", "Herzog & Kinski = Logic and passion.", "Though less apocalyptical than usual, the imagery is as lavish as ever, but the film is wrecked by an underwritten narrative.", "", "The finest adaptation of Joseph Conrad not based on Conrad.", "", "Flaws acknowledged, 'Cobra Verde' is a stunning, beautiful epic."], "rating": ["", "B-", "", "3/4", "3/4", "", "4/6", "3/4", "4.5/5", "", "", "5/5", "", "3/5", "4/4", "3/5", "6"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Octavi Marti", "Dennis Schwartz", "Hilary Mantel", "Jeff Vice", "Sean P.
