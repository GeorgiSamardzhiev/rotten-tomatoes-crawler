{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Game show television producer Chuck Barris (Sam Rockwell) is at the height of his career. His creation, \"The Dating Game,\" is one of the network's top shows and he has just been given the post of hosting his latest brainchild, \"The Gong Show.\" But what the public and industry big-wigs are unaware of is that Chuck Barris, game show pioneer, is also a covert assassin. He works for the C.I.A. and claims to have killed 33 people.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "George Clooney", "studio": "MadChance,SectionEightLtd.", "theater_date": "Jan 17, 2003", "dvd_date": "Nov 7, 2016", "box_office": "$16.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Kaufman's script, and particularly his dialogue, is pitch perfect.", "The film does not offer any explanations.

He has overcorrected and made a glum, almost listless movie.", "Directing a movie is no picnic, but I'll be damned if Mr. Clooney doesn't make it seem like fun.", "Brimming with slightly self-conscious directorial panache, the movie zips between nearly three decades, fantasy and reality without ever really deciding how seriously it wants to take itself.", "A terrific actor, a handsome movie star and now an accomplished director--damn you, Mr. Clooney, for making it that much more unfair for the average joe likes of myself.", "Clooney directs it! How could it be any good?", "", "Noir fantasy with the pop funkiness of '70s game shows", "Un prodigio narrativo muy diferente a todo lo que suele producir Hollywood, pero no por capricho de un director sino al servicio de una historia y de un punto de vista.", "Bounces around like the smarter and weirder older brother of Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can.", "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind is freakin' brilliant. Sam Rockwell gives a whack-you-upside-the-head dose of his talent!", "...a one-note character study about an unhappy, insecure, delusional paranoiac, whose assassin gimmick wears thin almost before it gets started.", "Because of movies like this, nostalgia just ain't what it used to be.", "Directing for the first time, Clooney turns out to be a natural when it comes to parody...", "Clooney has made a stylish debut, wisely making his movie resemble the wacky game shows Barris dreamt up."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "3/4", "A", "4/5", "", "3/5", "3/5", "3.5/4", "", "3.5/4", "1/10", "C+", "3/4", "", "", "4/4", "5/10", "", "", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Namrata Joshi", "Candice Frederick", "Hollis Griffin", "Urban Cinefile Critics", "Mark Halverson", "Rob Gonsalves", "Joe Lozito", "", "Michael Dequina", "Tony Medley", "Daniel Kasman", "Judith Egerton", "Enrique Buchichio", "Tim Robey", "Emily Blunt", "John J.
