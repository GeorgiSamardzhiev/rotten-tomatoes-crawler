But this is a very small carp at a very fine movie.", "The whole thing depends on Newman's blue eyes, easy grin, and ability to appear charismatic but never cocky.", "As this 'Southern' turns up the heat, the sense of sadistic oppression, of being looked down on by 'the man,' swelters and burns. The glowering sun eclipses the convict in its hellfire glow. Newman/Luke's knowing smile, though, burns on.", "An incredible film...", "It's easy to forget just how fine Cool Hand Luke is.", "...a gulag melodrama, if such a thing is possible.", "", "Stuart Rosenberg's direction is a horror, but the cast teems with so many familiar faces that this 1967 film can't help but entertain.", "Anchored by Paul Newman's thoroughly magnetic performance...", "Newman remains watchable and glamorous throughout, bloody, muddy or coated in torso-flattering sweat, but the film's efforts to sentimentally \"humanize\" him by psychological revelation are clumsy.", "The lines and the character have survived the film's oft-forgotten actual message.", "Cool Hand Luke now seems more like a well-made entertainment than any kind of American masterpiece.", "...most viewers will have little failure understanding the movie and its motives. They communicate brilliantly.", "One of those movies you remember Great Moments from.", "A picture of chilling dramatic power.", "Too cool for words, then switches past midstream into a work of poignancy and power.", "A tough, taut, smart milestone in the evolution of the American anti-hero, and cracking entertainment too."], "rating": ["4/4", "", "8/10", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "4/4", "4/5", "", "3/4", "3/4", "4/5", "", "1", "5/5", "", "5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tom Meek", "John Mahoney", "Mike Massie", "Wilfrid Sheed", "Jake Wilson", "Brian Gibson", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "", "Josh Larsen", "Robert Levin", "Dave Kehr", "David Nusair", "Bill Weber", "Chris Cabin", "Jeffrey M.
