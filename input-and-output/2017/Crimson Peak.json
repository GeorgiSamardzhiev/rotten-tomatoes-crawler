[Full Review in Spanish]", "If Merchant-Ivory made a horror film it would look something like this.", "There's nothing else like it out right now, and if you've got an inner Goth or English major, this will be right up your alley. It's utterly unique, and could only have been made by Guillermo del Toro.", "There are so many holes in [the] story, I just don't think it's salvageable.", "Overall, Crimson Peak is gorgeous to look at, but is ultimately let down by its half-baked plot.", "Crimson Peak is visually stunning and offers sophisticated performances but the tragic story won't be remembered for its content as much as its presentation.", "The greatness and failure of Crimson Peak as a film are altogether at war with each other.", "The master of magic has created something wonderful to look at but emotionally null and void.", "Thoroughly engaging, del Toro delivers a stylistically classy film that is sure to please.", "Each of the actors handles the drama with aplomb, and they sell the fright with vigor - especially Chastain, who gives a stirring performance as a grave woman whose grating demeanor suggests a cat with ready claws.", "I unapologetically LOVE Crimson Peak for everything that it is ... yes, even Charlie Hunnam as Edith's sad-eyed, shafted suitor. Incredible, I know.", "Nothing, however, could distract from the stunningly detailed gothic imagery which, like in many del Toro pictures, supersedes everything else.", "It's all a little over the top, at times, but that's all part of the fun and del Toro sustains the interest throughout."], "rating": ["", "5/10", "9/10", "2.5/5", "A", "B+", "", "", "7", "", "", "3/5", "6.3/10", "C+", "3/5", "4/5", "B", "", "7.5/10", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jordy Sirkin", "Mike Massie", "Alex Maidy", "Nicholas Bell", "Allen Almachar", "Brent McKnight", "Damond Fudge", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Norman Gidney", "Tim Brennan", "Chris McCoy", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Brandon Davis", "Leslie Combemale", "Thom Denson", "Mae Abdulbaki", "Preston Barta", "Amie Simon", "Bernard Boo", "Paula Fleri-Soler"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Jordy Reviews It", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">JoBlo&#39;s Movie Network", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KCCI (Des Moines, IA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">HorrorBuzz", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">About Boulder", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flick Feast", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ComicBook.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies with Mae", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fresh Fiction", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Three Imaginary Girls", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Way Too Indie", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times of Malta"], "date": ["January 2, 2021", "December 4, 2020", "October 26, 2020", "October 13, 2020", "July 14, 2020", "July 3, 2020", "June 29, 2020", "April 10, 2020", "February 24, 2020", "February 13, 2020", "January 10, 2020", "November 18, 2019", "November 13, 2019", "October 16, 2019", "April 18, 2019", "April 10, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 2, 2019", "February 28, 2019", "February 23, 2019"]}}
