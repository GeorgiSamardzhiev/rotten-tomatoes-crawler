{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Tells the story of Rainbow Randolph (Robin Williams), the corrupt, costumed star of a popular children's TV show, who is fired over a bribery scandal and replaced by squeaky-clean Smoochy (Edward Norton), a puffy fuscia rhinoceros.

Death to Smoochy is a cry likely to be heard by ticketbuyers as well.", "Robin Williams' manic energy is put to perfect use in this amusing and twisted comedy.", "I giggled all the way through \"Death to Smoochy.\" It wasn't that ha-ha giggle, it was that evil, kind of maniacal giggle.", "Comdia de humor negro com direo excessiva de DeVito, traz Edward Norton em um bom desempenho.  uma pena que o roteiro no tenha sido melhor aproveitado, j que este filme poderia ser mais interessante.", "Suffers from the same problem as most of the shows it pokes fun at - it runs on for far too long . . . to maintain a firm hold on the attention span of it's intended audience.", "Director DeVito has referred to this film as 'a cross between Barney and Pulp Fiction.' He wishes.", "It's bizarre, wild, entertaining and deliciously dark. Death to Smoochy is a splendid parody as Danny DeVito revels in the darkness of the project and Robin Williams excels at the wild swings of madness the role demands.
