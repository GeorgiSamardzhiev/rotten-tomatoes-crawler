Instead, Gru decides to remain retired and travel to Freedonia to meet his long-lost twin brother for the first time.

They are cute in small doses and they don't overstay their welcome in this movie.", "Retaining enough of the heart and humor to keep us satisfied.", "Despicable Me 3 isn't going to win any awards, but it's frenetic energy and dedication to adult-level silly is admirable, so much so that it's easily the best of the bunch.", "Despicable Me 3 has a lot going for it yet, somehow, it just doesn't have the same feel as the first two films and drags a little.", "Too many storylines, not enough Minions.", "The cinematic equivalent of a movie jingling its keys...It's assuming that kids don't have an attention span beyond three-ish minutes.", "The family element, which was the central theme of the first two, is not captured as well here.", "It's nothing special, but it's not awful.", "Pretty decent sequel that delivers and doesn't deny the fact that maybe it depends too much on the now independent 'minions'. [Full review in Spanish].", "I end this look at the film, hoping the filmmakers will consider an end, as well. Gru and company have had a good run with levels of success most films can only dream of.", "Despicable Me 3 is easy for young children to watch, but suffers from a lack of focused storytelling and an unwanted dedication to nostalgia.", "Even with all the bells and whistles, and the introduction of a clever villain, Despicable Me 3 wears out its welcome quickly and turns into an overstuffed excursion that eventually becomes more exhausting than entertaining.", "It [message] complements [its] absurdity perfectly within this consistently charming, welcomingly spare, and infectiously funny franchise.", "What it lacks in the story department, the film makes up in creativity and silly fun for the whole family.", "Despicable Me 3 wants to have something for everyone, but it spreads everything too thin, stretching some things too long and giving others short shrift. The results aren't despicable, but they are mostly bland at best.", "As silly and delightful as Despicable Me 3 is, there are sentimental and warm-fuzzy family moments delivered with genuine sincerity.", "Overall, this is a fun movie in a fun series. They definitely left the door open for a fourth movie and I'll definitely go see it when it comes out.", "The Despicable Me franchise, which follows a bumbling ex-villain as he tries his best to be a good example to a trio of orphans, has evolved from a relatively amiable cartoon with a genuinely safe concept to an unabashed cash grab."], "rating": ["3/5", "4/10", "3/5", "3.0/4", "", "2.5/5", "1.5/4", "", "", "C+", "3/4", "6.2", "2.5/5", "C", "7/10", "3.5/5", "C", "", "7.5/10", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Jason Best", "Mike Massie", "Paul McGuire Grimes", "Richard Propes", "Steven Prokopy", "Allison Rose", "Jeff Mitchell", "Dan Murrell", "S.
