{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A controlling, manipulative father (Christos Stergioglou) locks his three adult offspring in a state of perpetual childhood by keeping them prisoner within the sprawling family compound. The children are bored to tears in spite of distractions like Christina (Anna Kalaitzidou), an employee of their father's who makes regular visits to sexually service the son (Hristos Passalis). Increasingly curious about the outside world, the older daughter (Aggeliki Papoulia) hatches a plan to escape.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 34m", "director": "Yorgos Lanthimos", "studio": "GreekFilmCenter,HorseflyProductions,BooProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$110.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...Dogtooth is perverse.", "Dogtooth has bite, and while it isn't always easy to watch, it's one of the most uniquely haunting, and unnerving, films of 2010.", "We watch on and on - sometimes in horror, often in confusion, and always in complete awe of its strange and perplexing energy.", "Lanthimos has produced a film that continues to run in your mind after the credits roll, only we are free to enjoy what the characters lack -- normality.", "With much less at its disposal, it out-Cronenbergs Cronenberg by way of a sunny creepiness that insists on its normality even as it turns incestuous and bloody. Primarily about language and the family, it should be seen by homeschoolers everywhere.", "Dogtooth is a freaky, fascinating, elegantly off-kilter little film.", "A miserable, consistently worthless piece of work...", "Cinephiles (have) reacted to Lanthimos' skewed vision in much the same way as the confined children at the heart of the story: through the inquisitive, excited eye of someone catching a glimpse of a new worldview for the first time.", "It's a triumph of a filmmaker having everything his own way -- for better or for worse.", "To put it mildly, \"Dogtooth\" is not for everyone, but it can grow on you even if you think you've rejected its influence.", "That I'm aghast must be a form of overload, and as baffled as I am by this dark underbelly of a film, I did enjoy it.", "...flirts with sadism, but it's much more than a sick stunt.", "Dogtooth is one of the funniest films of the past 12 months, an unforgettable social-satire, a devious little test of endurance for brave movie-lovers and the best argument against home-schooling since The Jonas Brothers.", "A kind of ingenious horror show you just can't take your eyes off of.", "This is the second feature for Lanthimos, and it's a leap from his well-received debut Kinetta. He skilfully doles out tantalizing pieces of information, keeping the viewer in a constant state of suspense and wonder.", "The true dark-horse nominee among this year's foreign-language Oscar contenders, Dogtooth leaves bite marks that stick around long after you are released from its grip.", "Horror and cold humor commingle in Dogtooth.", "Not the cheeriest subject for a movie, but somehow it works.", "Dogtooth has some definite surprises in it, and it does a terrific job of unfolding the story at an interesting and surprising pace so that nothing is over-explained.", "As a film, it's pure and singular, but it's not quite fully formed enough to be what one could call truly visionary."], "rating": ["3.5/5", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "B", "3/4", "", "3.5/4", "5/5", "9/10", "4/4", "3.5/4", "", "4/5", "", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Danielle Solzman", "Matthew Lucas", "David Keyes", "Lucy Popescu", "A.S.
