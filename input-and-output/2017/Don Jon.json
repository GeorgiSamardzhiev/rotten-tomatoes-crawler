{"metadata": {"synopsis": "New Jersey bartender Jon Martello (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) knows what's important: his friends, his family, his car, his church, his sexual conquests -- and porn. In fact, Jon is a porn addict and has never had a genuine relationship with a woman. However, when he meets Barbara (Scarlett Johansson) he has to change his operating methods, because Barbara won't be bedded easily. For the first time in his life, Jon begins a real courtship, but his obsession with erotica threatens to ruin everything.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 29m", "director": "Joseph Gordon-Levitt", "studio": "HitRecordFilms,RamBergman", "theater_date": "Sep 27, 2013", "dvd_date": "Jan 28, 2015", "box_office": "$24.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A stylish, crude look at romance with loads of laughs. It shows off Joseph Gordon-Levitt's promise as a filmmaker, but more importantly it reinvents the rom com in a fun - although vulgar - way.", "Despite a rather limiting viewpoint on porn and what constitutes healthy sexuality, Don Jon is an enjoyable and very funny deconstruction of the ways in which we objectify each other and ourselves.", "Joseph Gordon-Levitt's directorial debut is blessed with a tremendous female ensemble (Brie Larson, Julianne Moore and Scarlett Johansson) that lifts it higher than its thin rom-com premise.", "It's a tremendously entertaining and thought-provoking film.", "Joseph Gordon-Levitt shows promising ability as a filmmaker. He demonstrates strong control and interest in topics not often explored in the mainstream", "Joseph Gordon-Levitt is no flash in the pan as a writer or director. There is a confidence to the performance, and more importantly, to the production as a whole.", "Nothing more than a conventional Hollywood romantic-comedy hidden under a torrent of used Kleenex.", "A guilt-free pleasure!", "It's funny and smart, with good performances sprinkled throughout.", "Don Jon is simply too broad to make hay out of its mildly provocative premise.", "Don Jon isn't just a good effort from a first-time director. It's a pretty good film on its own too.", "For a film that is directly about finding substance in modern relationships to divert from the crass lack of realism and overt stylisation of porn, it's ironic how Levitt's film seems devoid of it.", "Still, while Don Jon is far from subtle, it's still smart, honest, salaciously funny and, at times, pleasantly surprising. It'll be very interesting to see what that kid from that TV show does next.", "The entire film is elevated by Julianne Moore, who is meant to illustrate the difference in maturity levels in the characters, but also demonstrates the difference in levels of acting ability in the actors.", "Joseph Gordon-Levitt in his directorial and writer debut gives us a film that is filled with some laugh out loud moments and if we can get past the frothiness, it is definitely a film worth seeing.", "Like porn itself, reaction will vary.", "Gordon Levitt, also the author of the script, is terribly funny... [Full review in Spanish]", "Gordon-Levitt's more modest aims help the last act's moralizing go down smoother than Steve McQueen's tongue-clucking opus, but only just.", "Don Jon is breezy, provocative and definitely makes for an interesting discourse of sex and relationships. Check it out.", "As a simple and sweet coming-of-age story for the Jersey Shore generation, it's perfectly entertaining stuff."], "rating": ["4/5", "", "3/4", "3.5/4", "B", "", "2/5", "4/5", "B", "2/5", "9/10", "2/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "B-", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Kerensa Cadenas", "Tom Meek", "Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "David Harris", "Chris Davies", "Micheal Compton", "Craig Williams", "Jennifer Heaton", "Alistair Ryder", "Molly Templeton", "Asia Frey", "Rosalynn Try-Hane", "Tara Thorne", "Pablo O.
