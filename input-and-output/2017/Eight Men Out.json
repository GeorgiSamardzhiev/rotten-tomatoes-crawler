{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The Chicago White Sox, who are set to play the Cincinnati Reds in the World Series of 1919, are at odds with their team's owner, Charles Comiskey (Clifton James), who pays his players unsatisfactory wages despite the team's popularity. A group of professional gamblers offers the Sox's best athletes a fortune to throw the series, and the players agree. However, their reputations and careers are ruined when the dark secret, dubbed the \"Black Sox Scandal,\" reaches the public consciousness.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "John Sayles", "studio": "OrionPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 29, 2017", "box_office": "$4.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Robert Richardson, who'd go on to shoot nearly all of Quentin Tarantino's movies, including \"Once Upon a Time ... in Hollywood,\" crafts compelling visuals, and Sayles' writing, as always, is major league.", "Although Eight Men Out is a serious, sober effort... I found it neither clumsy nor doctrinaire.", "Aside from its moving study of greed, corruption and loss, the film provides a wonderful glimpse at life inthe post-World War I era.", "The tone of Eight Men Out is reminiscent of the droll irony of John Huston's considerations of the vanity of human wishes and the corrupting power of money.", "The light shed on this dark period of sports history makes Eight Men Out essential moviegoing. But what makes it heartbreaking is watching the toll taken on champions betraying their talent on a field of honor.", "Unfortunately, the movie's didacticism returns in the lengthy and somewhat tedious courtroom ending dealing with the aftermath of the Series.", "It's a sad and compelling piece that is totally convincing and doesn't require a knowledge of baseball.", "Does a fine job in getting to the details of the baseball scandal.", "Sayles deftly re-creates the forces that drove men at top of their class on the diamond to take bribes: big-time crime in Chicago and heartless management in the head office.", "It's a period re-created with a whoosh of energy and a redeeming vein of irony.", "The ensemble performances are of such a uniformly high caliber that our interest in the story never wavers.", "Eight Men Out never gathers much authority; the old themes have been hung on a rickety structure that constantly threatens to collapse.", "The story is lumpy in spots, but fine performances and expressive camera work carry the day.", "In an ensemble movie like this one, an actor who grabs too much of the limelight can throw everything out of focus. The cast Sayles has assembled understands the value of teamwork.", "A treat for baseball fans but might bore others.", "In 1988, writer-director John Sayles made his most ambitious film to date with this intelligent chronicle of the 1919 sports scandal, cast with some of the best actors around (Strathairn, Cusack, Sweeney, Sheen).", "Sayles' excellent film is more of a human tragedy than a sports movie -- meaning that even those with a limited knowledge of baseball should find it fascinating stuff.", "Sayles often seems like a man who, trying to stretch a single, gets caught between bases and is desperately trying to evade the rundown.", "Sayles gives the film an intelligent, well-researched, nostalgic tone with plenty of quiet moments to round out the excitement.", "Sayles not only depicts the circumstances that led to the fix (most notably Sox owner Charles Comiskey's legendary tightfistedness), but he also re-creates the games in great detail, making the best possible use of an athletic cast."], "rating": ["", "", "", "4/4", "", "", "3/5", "B", "", "", "3/4", "2/4", "", "", "4/5", "B+", "", "", "", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Loren King", "Hilary Mantel", "Judy Watson", "Desmond Ryan", "Peter Travers", "Ben Yagoda", "Adrian Turner", "Dennis Schwartz", "John Dolen", "Sheila Benson", "Gene Siskel", "Dave Kehr", "David Sterritt", "Jay Boyar", "Randy White", "Emanuel Levy", "", "Richard Schickel", "Jeffrey M.
