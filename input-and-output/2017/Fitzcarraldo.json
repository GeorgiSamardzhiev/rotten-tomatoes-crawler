{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Opera-loving European Brian Fitzgerald (Klaus Kinski) lives in a small Peruvian city. Better known as Fitzcarraldo, this foreigner is obsessed with building an opera house in his town and decides that to make his dream a reality he needs to make a killing in the rubber business. In order to become a successful rubber baron, Fitzcarraldo hatches an elaborate plan that calls for a particularly impressive feat -- bringing a massive boat over a mountain with the help of a band of natives.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "2h 40m", "director": "Werner Herzog", "studio": "WernerHerzogFilmproduktion", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 11, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["In between the limits of a curious, original, and unexpected work, Fitzcarraldo drags because of its excessive duration. [Full Review in Spanish]", "This botched, shapeless, gratuitous, ignoble, neo-colonialist film is so poorly made, written, edited, and directed that its centerpiece, its raison d'tre -- the honest-to-God hauling of a boat up a mountain before your eyes -- is meaningless.", "...captures both the bravery and the danger of Fitzcarraldo's determination.", "\"Fitzcarraldo,\" the latest production from German director Werner Herzog, appears to be an advanced case of directorial self-absorption and self-glorification.", "Herzog's film confirms that dreamers and their obsessions can give us otherwise unimaginable moments of pure beauty.", "Herzog charts an ironically circular course around an indulged, benevolent Aguirre; perversely illuminates colonialism with surrealism; and demonstrates once again in his always suspect yet somehow irresistible way that 'only dreamers move mountains'.", "A abordagem de imerso adotada por Herzog, somada  performance intensa de Kinski, resulta numa experincia nica e inesquecvel.", "", "", "The film may have been intended as an ironic comment on the absurdity of human ambition, but it's an irony that explodes in Herzog's face.", "", "Awesome, hypnotic storytelling, Fitzcarraldo finds this director working in top form", "If you have a dream, the only way to accomplish it is to face it head on. If your dream requires you to drag a massive boat up a mountainside, do it.
