{"metadata": {"synopsis": "London is held in the grip of a serial killer whose modus operandi is to murder his victims by strangling them with a necktie. When short-tempered ex-Royal Air Force officer Richard Blaney (Jon Finch) discovers his ex-wife (Barbara Leigh-Hunt) murdered, Blaney becomes a suspect. Forced to go on the run, Blaney attempts to take refuge with his best friend, fruit merchant Bob Rusk (Barry Foster), however Rusk may, in fact, be the necktie murderer himself.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Drama/Horror/Mystery & Suspense/Special Interest/Romance", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "Alfred Hitchcock", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 5, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Somewhat lacking for Hitchcock, despite its fascinating deviations from his usual projects.", "Hitchcock's most graphic film is also his most unsettling.", "Once a Londoner, always a Londoner. Hitchcock's return to home ground, twenty-two years after Stage Fright, is a remarkable performance in most senses of the word.", "By using London, a city that has preserved a tradition of citizen safety and civilization, as the background, Hitchcock creates a sharp tension between the city and the rapist-strangler who is running loose.", "In case there was any doubt, back in the dim days of Marnie and Topaz, Hitchcock is still in fine form. Frenzy is the dazzling proof.", "Armed with a superior script by Anthony Shaffer, an excellent cast, and a top technical crew, Alfred Hitchcock fashions a firstrate melodrama about an innocent man hunted by Scotland Yard for a series of sex-strangulation murders.", "Hitchcock's penultimate film deals with many of his previous themes with typical grim comedy and insight into a psychopathic killer's mind.", "There's no sign of the serenity and settledness that generally mark the end of a career. Frenzy, instead, continues to question and probe, and there is a streak of sheer anger in it that seems shockingly alive.", "While some regard this as inferior fare, it remains an unsettling piece from a director in his twilight years.", "Alfred Hitchcock's best suspense film in over a decade.", "There is a thorough sense of entertainment boiling over the pot here, and the material is well acted, skillful, and photographed with intensity.", "Frenzy marked 3 kinds of return for Hitchcock: return to England after 20 years, return to form after some flops, and return to the kind of commercial film he's most clearly associated with.", "Hitchcock's first British film in almost two decades marked a smashing return to his earlier form.", "This is one of Hitchcock's best and least appreciated films, with the Master getting a creative boost after a minor slump.", "Middle of the road Hitch but still terrific.", "Rather than classic Hitchcock, Frenzy feels more like a lesser director's cookie-cutter 'Hitchcockian' knock-off.", "Frenzy is easily the strongest of the master's final works.", "Hitchcock's return to Covent Garden, 'wrong man' plotting, the neuroses of sexual immaturity, and black-humoured slapstick ironies, tied up neatly in Anthony Shaffer's screenplay from the novel by Arthur Le Bern.", "Even in his waning days Hitchcock created a unique brand of suspense.", "This is the kind of thriller Hitchcock was making in the 1940s, filled with macabre details, incongruous humor, and the desperation of a man convicted of a crime he didn't commit."], "rating": ["8/10", "3.5/5", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "4/5", "", "3.5/4", "A-", "", "", "4/5", "", "3/4", "", "4/5", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Michael J.
