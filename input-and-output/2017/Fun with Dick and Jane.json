{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After Dick Harper (Jim Carrey) loses his job at Globodyne in an Enron-esque collapse, he and his wife, Jane (T\u00e9a Leoni), turn to crime in order to handle the massive debt they now face. Two intelligent people, Dick and Jane actually get pretty good at robbing people and even enjoy it -- but they have second thoughts when they're reminded that crime can hurt innocent people. When the couple hears that Globodyne boss Jack McCallister (Alec Baldwin) actually swindled the company, they plot revenge.", "rating": "28", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Dean Parisot", "studio": "ColumbiaPictures", "theater_date": "Dec 21, 2005", "dvd_date": "Jan 8, 2014", "box_office": "$110.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The final third of this movie isn't a remake of the original film but of the bland sappiness of the original kiddie books.", "A gummy remake of the George Segal/Jane Fonda 1977 comedy, this is evidently conceived as a showcase for Carrey's waning talents, but it suffers from a mouldy premise and the slightly unsavoury underlying message.", "If you are one of the many out of work right now, try this movie for a good laugh.", "Fun with Dick and Jane is an extended Enron joke used to give Jim Carrey plenty of opportunity to mug for the camera. Everything else is more or less perfunctory to that.", "Consider it a signed confession of remake rape when a \"produced by Jim Carrey\" credit appears atop his noodle-limbed exaggeration of \"I Believe I Can Fly.\" his corporate-greed satire doesn't just lack bite. It lacks gnaw. It even lacks nibble.", "", "The downward mobility of the middle class straight to the poverty level, or crime often not as evil, but rather economic desperation, are plot points hardly likely to sit well with those who control this economy and profit from it.", "An entertaining and zippy 87 minutes.", "", "", "In a strange way, it's fitting that a movie about people out of work should itself barely work.", "This cynical look at how the American family can only achieve their dreams through crime is a bit more of a political statement rather than comedic entertainment.", "", "", "A sharp, funny shot at people taking their luxe life too seriously.", "The film proposes Carrey as an Everyman for the 21st century. But if you don't sympathize with the film's variations on the American Dream, that's a frightening thought.", "Se puede ver simple y sencillamente para pasar el rato, con una buena bolsa de palomitas y un refresco al lado.", "A razor-sharp satire on class struggle and the evaporating America dream, which adroitly masquerades as a screwball star turn.", "Carrey and Leoni don't achieve much chemistry, mostly because she's so busy playing straight man to his antics.", "If fun means money, this is near bankrupt."], "rating": ["", "", "B", "6/10", "0/4", "2/4", "", "", "2/4", "1/4", "2/4", "2/4", "1/5", "3/5", "3/4", "", "3/4", "3/5", "", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mark Steyn", "Catherine Shoard", "Candice Frederick", "Joshua Starnes", "Nick Rogers", "Joe Lozito", "Prairie Miller", "Doris Toumarkine", "Robert Roten", "Peter Travers", "Peter T.
