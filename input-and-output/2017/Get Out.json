At first, Chris reads the family's overly accommodating behavior as nervous attempts to deal with their daughter's interracial relationship, but as the weekend progresses, a series of increasingly disturbing discoveries lead him to a truth that he never could have imagined.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Jordan Peele", "studio": "UniversalPictures,QCEntertainment,BlumhouseProductions", "theater_date": "Feb 24, 2017", "dvd_date": "May 9, 2017", "box_office": "$176.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A tense, creeping drama that gets under your skin, makes you laugh and then explodes outward in the most satisfying, pulpy of ways. Get Out is all of those things.", "Get Out is a smart, quite funny, and startling picture, you just have to see it.", "With a perfect balance of terror and comedy, this smart, slightly-satirical look on society and racism is a well crafted film that dives even deeper than you expect.", "Kaluuya is exceptionally grounded (continuously tossing around genuinely inquisitive expressions), making the eerie situations more realistic and more humorous.", "Contains that third act twist that comes with smart horror movies. By the end, the audience was cheering and applauding...", "Get Out is an achievement on a textual, metatextual, and subtextual level that is effectively a roadmap for filmmakers trying to build a political message into their genre fiction.", "One of the best films of the year for 2017.", "Jordan Peele delivers the best movie of the decade thanks to masterful symbolism of American flag wardrobe, cell-phone justice, cotton-picking escapes and dialogue double meanings.", "They say \"a mind is a terrible thing to waste\" and in Jordan Peele's directorial debut, Get Out is certainly one of the most accomplished films of the year.", "It can work as a suspense thriller, a horror comedy, or as a launching point for a deeper social conversation.", "A surprising film that shows Peele's versatility as well as enormous creative potential as writer, producer and director. [Full review in Spanish]", "Sharp and satirical, frustratingly topical and poignant, \"Get Out\" insightfully explores race in America while delivering a banger of a horror movie.", "The complexity, though, is reduced by caricaturing the Armitage family and their guests as unfeeling monsters[.]", "Get Out is the kind of thriller that will crawl under your skin and worm its way into your brain, making you think about it long after it's over.", "The horror is effective because Peele, who is also a comedian, supports it with a social commentary that criticizes the most brutal veins of racism in current American society. [Full review in Spanish]", "I did think it was very interesting and I'm excited for Jordan Peele to make more movies.", "I liked it for what it was... I was entertained.", "Get Out is so damn smart, funny, and impressively directed by Peele, who embraces certain great horror tropes, but never forgetting that the best horror and sci-fi often includes clandestine messages and commentary on modern society.", "Jordan Peele takes us on a frustrating yet ultimately victorious ride with his race-based mystery horror movie. Get Out combines genuine thrills with a no-holds-barred critique of black-white relations.", "Peele seduces, subverts and manipulates audience expectations - as the masters Alfred Hitchcock, John Carpenter, and Stanley Kubrick did before him."], "rating": ["5/5", "3.5/4", "", "7/10", "", "5/5", "3.5/4", "4/4", "5/5", "A", "", "A", "", "", "7/10", "", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tony Black", "Leo Brady", "Jordy Sirkin", "Mike Massie", "Paul McGuire Grimes", "Leigh Monson", "Richard Propes", "Jason Fraley", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Allen Almachar", "Ricardo Gallegos", "Brent McKnight", "CJ Sheu", "Damond Fudge", "Yasser Medina", "Avaryl Halley", "Andrew Galdi", "Steven Prokopy", "Rhod\u00e9 Marshall", "Anne Thompson"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cultural Conversation", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AMovieGuy.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Jordy Reviews It", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KSTP-TV (St. Paul, MN)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Substream Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WTOP (Washington, D.C.)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Confessions From A Geek Mind", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">P\u00f3lvora", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Review Film Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KCCI (Des Moines, IA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Third Coast Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">City Press (South Africa)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">indieWire"], "date": ["February 14, 2021", "February 7, 2021", "January 2, 2021", "December 5, 2020", "November 5, 2020", "September 24, 2020", "September 8, 2020", "September 3, 2020", "August 26, 2020", "July 11, 2020", "July 2, 2020", "July 2, 2020", "July 1, 2020", "June 30, 2020", "June 27, 2020", "May 11, 2020", "May 11, 2020", "May 4, 2020", "April 15, 2020", "March 31, 2020"]}}
