{"metadata": {"synopsis": "James Brown (Chadwick Boseman) was born in extreme poverty in 1933 South Carolina and survived abandonment, abuse and jail to become one of the most influential musicians of the 20th century. He joined a gospel group as a teenager, but the jazz and blues along the \"chitlin' circuit\" became his springboard to fame. Although his backup musicians came and went, Brown retained the ability to mesmerize audiences with his music, signature moves and sexual energy.", "rating": "80", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 18m", "director": "Tate Taylor", "studio": "JaggedFilms,BrianGrazer", "theater_date": "Aug 1, 2014", "dvd_date": "Jan 26, 2016", "box_office": "$30.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One big chunk of funk with a gold standard performance from Boseman and music that will make you want to... er... get on up.", "Chadwick Boseman does a great job of playing James Brown who had so much personality and was such a loud character", "Boseman's charismatic and eerily accurate performance as American R&B legend James Brown is truly something to behold.", "There is a lot covered in the film, though Taylor nicely avoids the usual chronological storytelling.", "The way the script jumps around in time is a little sloppy, but Boseman is so dynamite it doesn't matter. A powerhouse performance is worth watching, no matter how it's framed.", "A biopic that dares to put a few extra wrinkles and curves into its narrative.", "In Get On Up, a great deal depends on the lead actor Boseman, who ably captures something important about Brown's outer and inner being.", "[T]his show ultimately belongs to [Chadwick] Boseman. He captures the groove, soul and even [James] Brown's incompressible speech and his performance is electric.", "If it weren't for the magnetic, utterly watchable central performance from a prolific Chadwick Boseman, Get On Up would be a miserly, unapologetically sterilized biopic.", "Whilst issues with exposition and pacing threaten to deflate Get on Up, captivating performances and electrifying music set-pieces manage to pump up the funk.", "Whenever producers weakly say they couldn't find good Black actresses for roles that usually end up going to white women, I can't help thinking of all the talented Black women going to waste in films like this one.", "[Get On Up] is also consistently entertaining and intermittently moving, but by the end, we realize that it hasn't been all that illuminating.", "[Chadwick Boseman] gets the mannerisms right, and builds a volatile character who's opportunistic, frightening and vulnerable, like a funky Klaus Kinski.", "An arresting encapsulation of Brown's dichotomy of being at once a soulful singer and at the same time a man incapable of showing affection.", "Get On Up struggles, at times, to surprise us.", "[Chadwick] Boseman captures the volatility, on and offstage, of the entity we recognize as James Brown, the flamboyance, the fierce ambition, and the uncompromising determination to be treated with respect.", "Get On Up is enjoyable...it's about funk and a funk legend after all.", "[Chadwick] Boseman is a delight.", "Warts and all, in fits and starts, finally the Hardest Working Man in Show Business gets his story told.", "The narrative is unsatisfying as it leaves lots of unanswered questions."], "rating": ["4/5", "", "4/5", "3.5/4", "3/4", "4/5", "", "4/5", "2.5/5", "4/5", "", "B", "", "4/5", "", "3/4", "3.5/5", "", "", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Rachel Wagner", "Leigh Paatsch", "Richard Propes", "Jason Fraley", "Don Shanahan", "Joanne Laurier", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Nicholas Bell", "Ben Murphie", "Ren Jender", "Abbie Bernstein", "Pat Padua", "Joseph Walsh", "Matthew Bond", "Lisa Jensen", "Francesca Rudkin", "Kathy Fennessy", "Dwight Brown", "Neil Rosen"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rachel&#39;s Reviews (YouTube)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WTOP (Washington, D.C.)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">25YL (25 Years Later)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flick Feast", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bitch Flicks", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Assignment X", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">DCist", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Mail on Sunday (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Good Times Santa Cruz", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Zealand Herald", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Stranger (Seattle, WA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">National Newspaper Publishers Association", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">NY1-TV"], "date": ["February 1, 2021", "September 13, 2020", "September 11, 2020", "August 31, 2020", "August 29, 2020", "August 15, 2020", "August 13, 2020", "November 19, 2019", "August 30, 2019", "May 31, 2019", "March 12, 2019", "January 11, 2019", "August 31, 2018", "August 22, 2018", "October 30, 2017", "September 12, 2017", "September 7, 2017", "August 22, 2017", "March 21, 2017", "August 17, 2016"]}}
