{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Sworn to preserve intergalactic order, the Green Lantern Corps has existed for centuries. Its newest recruit, Hal Jordan (Ryan Reynolds), is the first human to join the ranks. The Green Lanterns have little regard for humans, who have thus far been unable to harness the powers of the ring each member wears. But Jordan, a gifted and cocky test pilot, may be the corps' only hope when a new enemy called Parallax threatens the universal balance of power.", "rating": "26", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "Martin Campbell", "studio": "DeLinePictures", "theater_date": "Jun 17, 2011", "dvd_date": "Nov 15, 2013", "box_office": "$116.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The filmmakers are under the impression that audiences will accept anything, as long as it's drenched in special effects.", "Yet another film where the whole 3-D thing is a complete waste.", "The more I think about it the more I dislike it.", "Enjoyable enough despite obvious shortcomings.", "Among the many things that can be attributed to the movie signed by Campbell, not being entertaining is not one of them. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Podcast review", "Green Lantern's light faded for me, and was out completely by the time the final credits rolled.", "Green Lantern is as cheesy and has more plot holes and dangling story strings than a piece of 70's macrame.", "The film never rises above a screenplay that seems to be pulling in several directions, leaving the material battling with tone and consistency. The result is a lifeless attempt at a blockbuster that never quite gets out of the block.", "All the prancing about on a galaxy far far away where Hal [Ryan Reynolds] meets the other Green Lanterns, and the wise ancients, and a gigantic gruff sergeant-type who learns him his ropes is all a bit of a bore.", "There are some fun moments in Green Lantern, and Reynolds and Sarsgaard...are truly worth watching. The movie, however, flickers between being fun and a mess.", "While he's not a compelling enough character or superhero to care about, as Green Lantern, [Ryan Reynolds is] believable in his solemnity, yet his comedic charm helps when dealing with the absurdity that comes with the premise.", "With a cast like that, this superhero flick, like Hal Jordan himself, had real potential to rise above its provenance. But the dialogue is simply beyond cheesy.", "In brightest day, in blackest night...No cliche will escape my sight...I guess its really not that bad...But it certainly is loud and bright.", "This isn't quite the stake through the heart of the superhero movie that some of its most vociferous critics are making it out to be, but it sure isn't the genre's brightest day, either.", "If you haven't seen it, DON'T BOTHER.", "This is pure popcorn entertainment, a one-dimensional outing that is more in the ballpark of Thor and Fantastic Four than anything else.", "Green Lantern is not a perfect movie, but it's fun to watch.", "Please please please do not make a sequel.", "It often feels like there are two separate stories featured in this comic book flick but neither of them is particularly interesting."], "rating": ["2/10", "2.0/4", "C-", "C+", "", "D", "2/5", "", "", "2.5/5", "B-", "", "2.5/5", "6/10", "C", "", "3/5", "B-", "", "2.0/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "Brent McKnight", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Julian Lytle", "Kate Rodger", "Leslie Combemale", "Micheal Compton", "Shubhra Gupta", "Abbie Bernstein", "Nathalia Aryani", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Johnny Gayzmonic", "Zaki Hasan", "Sarah Marrs", "Samuel Roberts", "Candice Frederick", "Lindy West", "John Hanlon"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Ignorant Bliss", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newshub (NZ)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Indian Express", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Assignment X", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Diego Entertainer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Examiner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fanboys of the Universe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Zaki&#39;s Corner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinesnark", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">SciFiNow", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Talk Online", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Stranger (Seattle, WA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Big Hollywood"], "date": ["November 30, 2020", "September 9, 2020", "August 6, 2020", "July 11, 2020", "April 23, 2020", "January 12, 2020", "August 24, 2019", "July 26, 2019", "May 8, 2019", "April 2, 2019", "February 13, 2019", "January 28, 2019", "January 8, 2019", "November 4, 2018", "November 2, 2018", "October 24, 2017", "September 19, 2017", "September 8, 2017", "August 25, 2017", "June 30, 2013"]}}
