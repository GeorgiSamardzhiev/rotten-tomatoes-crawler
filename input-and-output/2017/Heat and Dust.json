{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When Anne (Julie Christie) discovers a long-forgotten family scandal involving her deceased grandmother, Olivia (Greta Scacchi), she decides to investigate further by traveling to the scene of the crime: India. In the 1920s, Olivia had been married to an official in the colonial government, but had an affair with an Indian man that resulted in an abortion and disgrace. By coincidence, Anne also finds herself conducting an affair with an Indian man, and faces similar social prejudice.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 13m", "director": "James Ivory", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 12, 2017", "box_office": "$19.9K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Heat and Dust's mistake is the protraction of Anne's narrative into more than the framing device it logically ought to be.", "As a meditation on time, or colonialism, or national character, or on fashions in religion, philosophy, or medicine, or on the immutabilities of sex, Heat and Dust is as wise as it is unpretentious.", "In retreating from emotional involvement with its characters, Heat and Dust ultimately suffers from the gentility it parodies.", "Heat and Dust is an excellent film, best savored when accepting its slow rhythm. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Heat and Dust is a carefully plotted melodrama which is both vicious in its demeaning treatment of women, but also the troubling implications of festering post-colonialist issues.", "Only James Ivory's somnolent good taste could make this passage to India so drab, but he gets a bright performance from Julie Christie... and a ravishing one from Greta Scacchi.", "After 37 years, Heat and Dust stands up as an intelligent, ambitious, substantial picture - with flaws but also intriguing aspects that were perhaps not sufficiently understood at the time.", "There's a whole lot of cathartic pain in Heat and Dust, if you know where to look for it.", "It's unlikely to win over Merchant-Ivory skeptics, but it does represent an intriguing transition from the India-centered social realism of their earlier work to the lavish literary adaptations for which they would become famous.", "Lovely and leisurely, it lacks the repressed sexual \"heat\" of the greatest Merchant/Ivory/Jhabvala period pieces.", "", "Heat and Dust contains wonderful sights and sounds and textures.
