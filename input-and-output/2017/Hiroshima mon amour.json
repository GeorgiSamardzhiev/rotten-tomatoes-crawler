{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The deep conversation between a Japanese architect (Eiji Okada) and a French actress (Emmanuelle Riva) forms the basis of this celebrated French film, considered one of the vanguard productions of the French New Wave. Set in Hiroshima after the end of World War II, the couple -- lovers turned friends -- recount, over many hours, previous romances and life experiences. The two intertwine their stories about the past with pondering the devastation wrought by the atomic bomb dropped on the city.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Alain Resnais", "studio": "ComoFilm,ArgosFilms,DaieiStudios,Path\u00e9Entertainment", "theater_date": "May 16, 1960", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$88.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A stunning piece of cinema, Hiroshima Mon Amour is also one of Resnais' most emotionally affecting pieces, for one cannot help but be moved by these lovelorn people, struggling hopelessly against the onslaught of time and the doom of being forgotten.", "It employs a foredoomed romance between a French actress and a Japanese architect as a narrative thread that binds together a series of haunting reflections about life in the Atomic Age.", "Here -- for the first time since Eisenstein -- we have a cinematic intelligence so quick, so subtle, so original, so at once passionate and sophisticated that it can be compared with Joyce, with Picasso, with Berg and Bart\u00f3k and Stravinksy.", "Resnais, working from a screenplay by Marguerite Duras, delivers a striking opening that ultimately stands as a high point within the proceedings...", "It was one of the few movies in the world to express with near perfection the truth about the soul-destroying effects a city has on lovers, the pain it can cause them, the monsters that it turns them into.", "If so many films were not hybrids -half plays or half novels, half polemical or half literary-1 needn't say what it seems almost absurd to say, that Hiroshima Mon Amour is cinematic first, last and always.", "The film, a visual discovery that renewed the stagnation of so many directors of the time, was also about that relationship, combining it in a masterly way with political reflection, so that one could not exist without the other. [Full review in Spanish]", "Gorgeous and yearning, Hiroshima Mon Amour offers a still-modern thesis: Memory, like love, is a commodity that no one fully possesses.", "Over 50 years later, HMA is still aesthetically bold, yet somehow Resnais's radical stylistic shifts are never jarring, rather feeling like they are part of a cohesive whole.", "Exquisitely beautiful and harrowing meditation on war and love.", "...effortlessly moves us between past and present, personal and political.", "A most chic Guernica, sumptuously abstract and visceral", "a particularly compelling and fascinating film, one that has endured well beyond its importance in throwing open the gates to a new era in French cinema", "If \"Hiroshima, Mon Amour\" is best enjoyed for its place in film history, its tragic love story and its haunting black-and-white cinematography, that still makes it a veritable must-see.", "\"Hiroshima Mon Amour\" will always be too studied a masterwork for some tastes. But Riva's performance, chief among its triumphs, remains electrifying.", "That rare movie in which present and past meld in every frame to convey a sense of time obliterated, or a dream having a nightmare.", "The first film to juxtapose disastrous erotic passion with the political disasters of the mid century.", "The facticity of the film itself is continually called into question by Alain Resnais's decision to blur the boundaries between nonfiction and fiction films.", "[VIDEO ESSAY] Alain Resnais's early addition to the Nouvelle Vague cannon finds his pair of culturally diverse lovers of rising from the rubble of World War II.", "I can't say I really enjoyed myself watching Hiroshima mon amour.
