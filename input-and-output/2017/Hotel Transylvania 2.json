So, while Mavis and Johnny are away, Drac enlists his friends to help him put the boy through a \"monster-in-training\" boot camp. But things really get batty when Drac's cantankerous, old-school dad (Mel Brooks) pays an unexpected visit.", "rating": "55", "genre": "Animation", "runtime": "1h 29m", "director": "Genndy Tartakovsky", "studio": "SonyPicturesAnimation", "theater_date": "Sep 25, 2015", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The movie's family friendly scares won't give kids any nightmares, but it won't make them laugh either.", "It stays on safe ground at all times trusting that what has already been successful once will be accomplished again.

Nothing more, nothing less.", "We're taken it upon ourselves to warn travelers that this hotel has become the sort of soulless castle Dracula fears.", "A modestly charming sequel that's also the best thing Sandler has lent his name to in some time.", "It's nowhere near as stimulating and intellectual as a Pixar offering, but nowhere near as stupidly offensive as some of the atrocious crap that flood the animated genre simply because some parents will take their children to see anything", "A lazy and derivative sequel to the modestly successful 2012 children's animation.", "All of these exertions are just enough to graze the 90 minute mark, after which the film gratefully whumps to a close taking its paint-by-numbers character arcs and hopelessly generic jokes with it.", "There are few things as sad as an unkept promise, Hotel Transylania 2 does that for movies. [Full review in Spanish]", "With a joke well that runs dry nearly an hour too early, watches will be checked and previously unwanted popcorn kernels will be rigorously examined.", "A rip-roaring monster ball finale, complete with a whopping great punch-up featuring Dracula, Frankenstein, werewolves and bats, more than makes up for the flaws.", "Light on intelligent humour, heavy on the slapstick, the result is once again a mixed bag; an animated effort which will please the young viewers, but not anyone older than maybe 10.", "Still, the material is a lot stronger than anything in the premise-squandering Pixels or lackluster Paul Blart sequel.", "Adam Sandler's Dracula sinks his teeth into another batch of slapstick fun... so much more enjoyable than any of [his] recent live-action movies.", "Hotel Transylvania 2 succeeds in creating the sort of wacky visual comedy that kids love -- from slime monsters to screaming slices of wedding cake.", "Has its charms, but it disappoints with a script that feels sloppy and hastily slapped together.", "\"Hotel Transylvania 2\" isn't a horror movie, but like its predecessor, it's made for those who love these characters so much that we like to see them in children's movies", "If you liked the first Hotel Transylvania you'll like the second, but while the special 3D effects look great, the storyline can lack depth at times.", "What Sandler does pull off here is an uncommon feat: a sequel that's an improvement over the original, which itself was a solid movie.
