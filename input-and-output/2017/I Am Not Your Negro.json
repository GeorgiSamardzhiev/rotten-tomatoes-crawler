{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1979, James Baldwin wrote a letter to his literary agent describing his next project, \"Remember This House.\" The book was to be a revolutionary, personal account of the lives and assassinations of three of his close friends: Medgar Evers, Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr. At the time of Baldwin's death in 1987, he left behind only 30 completed pages of this manuscript.

The film is all of that, and more, a clear-eyed examination of the ugly wound in the land of the free.", "I Am Not Your Negro is montage and meditation, a dialogue between the archive and the present, a road movie without the road.", "Thirty years after his death, Baldwin's words and deeds still speak to an America that needs to listen.", "Director Raoul Peck weaves a breathtaking cinematic tapestry. Drawing from old interviews and college lectures, popular movies, blues music, and Baldwin's poetic words, Peck takes us on a tour of history.", "It's been 30 years since Baldwin died, but his words still ring true in this powerful film for a new generation.", "It is broad, complex, assertive and absolutely essential.", "If nothing else, I Am Not Your Negro makes you wish Baldwin were still with us, holding accountable feet to the fire while firing up the downtrodden.", "Baldwin's breakdown of why groups in power behave the way they do, Peck's stunning imagery, and Samuel L. Jackson's reserved narration open the door to a more hopeful future of equality.", "This film successfully presents an incredibly original and consequently impactful means of telling the story of a divided America.", "Effectively galvanizing and a pervasive punch to the functioning system, Negro is thoroughly gripping and a significant slice of surging cinema that dares to question the never-ending search for harmony and humanity that now feels completely lost.", "This documentary, based on Baldwin's unfinished Remember This House manuscript, offers a view of the United States as disturbingly relevant today as it was in the late 1970s.", "James Baldwin is exactly the right discursive proxy for this film's balance between history lesson and impressionistic treatise on the African-American experience.", "The continual vibrancy of Baldwin's ideas is underscored by Peck's intricate consideration of every frame of film.", "America is a nation that is built with pluralistic ideals yet often ignored those ideals when it came to Black Americans. You can't separate racism and America because the two are intrinsically tied together.", "Hearing Baldwin's amazing voice in a theatre is worth the price of admission alone."], "rating": ["5/5", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "B", "A", "5/5", "4/4", "", "4/5", "", "5/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Linda Marric", "Euan Ferguson", "Tom Meek", "Steven Prokopy", "Bilge Ebiri", "Tim Brennan", "Siddhartha Mitter", "Chris McCoy", "Rhys Tarling", "Linda and Al Lerner", "Michael J.
