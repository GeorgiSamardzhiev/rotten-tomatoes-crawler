{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1991, talented figure skater Tonya Harding becomes the first American woman to complete a triple axel during a competition. In 1994, her world comes crashing down when her ex-husband conspires to injure Nancy Kerrigan, a fellow Olympic hopeful, in a poorly conceived attack that forces the young woman to withdraw from the national championship. Harding's life and legacy instantly become tarnished as she's forever associated with one of the most infamous scandals in sports history.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 1m", "director": "Craig Gillespie", "studio": "IAFilms", "theater_date": "Jan 12, 2018", "dvd_date": "Feb 24, 2018", "box_office": "$30.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's messy, but this is a messy story about a woman who paid a heavy price for daring to be herself. Not conforming cost her everything but you get a sense, by the end of the film, it's a price she was willing to pay.", "Comedy-drama documentary about the rise and fall of Tonya Harding, the American figure-skater. It sounds like a simple sports biopic, and honestly, the story is much more complex.", "Humor is abundant in many of the establishing scenes, though they weave between sequences of emotional poignancy.", "Robbie, Janney, Stan, and Gillespie really nailed this tale by going for broke and giving the bittersweet true story a fair dose of punk rock rebellion.", "Regardless of your take on the morality of its conceit, the film is so undeniably compelling and well-crafted that it remains a must-see experience. It's not a typical Oscar contender; it's a gritty underdog that might just stick the landing.", "A frustrating and often troubling tonal nightmare that skates on thin ice for so long that it's always going to slip up.", "Under all the format gimmicks and stylization, the meta-references and winks at the audience, there is a real heart to this story. When Tonya falls apart at the 1994 Olympics, or breaks down after having skating taken away, her pain is palpable.", "I, Tonya is strictly an actor's film in theory, but those onscreen manage to breathe life into what can be a knowingly and unapologetically messy ride.", "Robbie is memorable both in Harding's anger explosions and in quiet scenes, those with enormous emotional weight. [Full review in Spanish]", "It's a film that's simultaneously real and outrageous, sympathetic and unflinching.", "It is a portrait 'made in America', which captures the rise and fall of the protagonist with extraordinary performances by Margot Robbie and Allison Janney. [Full review in Spanish]", "Director Craig Gillespie has reinvented the biopic, a notoriously dreary genre, by striking a hair-trigger balance between trauma and parody, mockumentary and melodrama, demolishing the fourth wall.", "Margot Robbie delivers a raw, disarmingly empathetic character study of the widely-despised Harding, who was born into poverty and rose to stardom only to be taken down by those who loved her.", "A nuanced, subversive, diamond-cutter of a film that may not always be reliable as we seek the truth, but it makes for a hell of a story however you slice it.", "Great performances.", "The tone was fun, interesting, aggressive.", "I, Tonya understands these people, and does so with sympathy and pitch-black humor.", "Even if [Tonya] Harding isn't someone you particularly like, the film succeeds in making us as the audience cheer for her at every turn.", "I, Tonya is a film whose smiling face conceals some very sharp teeth.", "[Margot] Robbie is too pretty to be Tonya but still pulls it off. Allison Janney is exceptional and memorable as a witch of a Mom. Both soar, score and nail the landing on film instead of ice."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "4/5", "8/10", "", "3.5/4", "2/5", "", "3.5/5", "", "", "8/10", "", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Alix Turner", "Mike Massie", "Dan Buffa", "Jason Fraley", "Tom Beasley", "Katie Duggan", "Matt Cipolla", "Ricardo Gallegos", "Damond Fudge", "Yasser Medina", "Erin Blackwell", "Dan Tabor", "Steven Prokopy", "Avaryl Halley", "Andrew Galdi", "Tim Brennan", "Peter Gray", "Chris McCoy", "Linda and Al Lerner"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Ready Steady Cut", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KSDK News (St. Louis)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WTOP (Washington, D.C.)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flickering Myth", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen Queens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Monthly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">P\u00f3lvora", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KCCI (Des Moines, IA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bay Area Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Phawker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Third Coast Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">About Boulder", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The AU Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies and Shakers"], "date": ["February 3, 2021", "January 28, 2021", "December 5, 2020", "November 10, 2020", "August 29, 2020", "August 14, 2020", "July 27, 2020", "July 23, 2020", "July 4, 2020", "June 30, 2020", "June 27, 2020", "June 3, 2020", "May 29, 2020", "May 21, 2020", "May 14, 2020", "May 14, 2020", "February 21, 2020", "February 15, 2020", "January 17, 2020", "October 10, 2019"]}}
