Heartbreaking. Incandescently beautiful.", "The beautiful vintage footage and Phillip Glass' striving, uplifting score make the film a pleasant journey as well as a delightful, insightful one.", "...the believed-lost footage of a 26-year-old Goodall from the early 1960s is illuminating from beginning to end and a technicolour dream.", "Smartly told and beautifully composed.", "[Hers] is a life that inspires generations-one of perseverance, intelligence, and empathy against all odds.", "A moving but flawed piece of documentary that could stand to fill in a few blanks, Jane is bolstered by a powerful score, sharp editing and an abundance of fascinating archive footage.", "Those who see Jane will no doubt walk away with newfound respect and admiration for her unassuming feminism and her contribution to the world.", "An enthralling watch from start to finish.", "Yet it didn't provide the big humbling rush of nature worship it promised, not least because Philip Glass's pushy score left no space for quiet contemplation.", "Watching Jane was like stepping back in time to a moment at which Homo sapiens learned something new and vital about its own family - the great apes. It was extraordinary.", "... a beautiful piece of work.", "The assured storytelling unfolds with acts of both creation and loss, as Goodall and von Lawick raise their infant son in the national park where they work while a polio epidemic ravages the chimpanzee population.", "This is documentary as beguiling storytelling.", "A riveting, inspiring, and moving true wonder woman story about an icon of primatology and feminism and world peace.", "Pioneering primatologist Jane Goodall has been the subject of several documentaries throughout her long, prominent and unique career. However, this new one from National Geographic's prestige production unit is clearly the best to date.", "The footage is astonishing: crisp, vibrant, immediate and beautifully framed ... has a surprising narrative drive ...
