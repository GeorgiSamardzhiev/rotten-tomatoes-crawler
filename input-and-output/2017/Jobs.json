{"metadata": {"synopsis": "College dropout Steve Jobs (Ashton Kutcher), together with his friend, technical whiz-kid Steve Wozniak (Josh Gad), sparks a revolution in home computers with the invention of the Apple 1 in 1976. Built in the garage of Jobs' parents, the device -- and the subsequent formation of Apple Inc. -- have changed the world for all time. Though he is viewed as a visionary, Jobs' tenure as Apple's leader is a rocky one, leading to his eventual ouster from the company he co-founded.", "rating": "28", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 5m", "director": "Joshua Michael Stern", "studio": "TheFiveStarInstitute", "theater_date": "Aug 16, 2013", "dvd_date": "Apr 22, 2014", "box_office": "$16.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One has the distinct feeling that Jobs himself would have been particularly unimpressed with Jobs the movie.", "A Steve Jobs biopic steeped in the mediocrity its subject despised.", "The film's major moving parts are damaged, effectively crashing the machine. Send this one back to the factory.", "It's just passable, which would not have passed Jobs' own standards.", "This dichotomy between what the film insists is Jobs at his best, and what we the audience see as Jobs at his arguable worst undermines the overall message and what we are supposed to take away from the movie.", "So impressed with its subject that it leaves precious little time to explore the imperfect man behind the icon.", "Jobs presents a fascinating story of how Jobs overcomes corporate backbiting and channels his own tendency toward obsession to build arguably the most innovative company of the last decade.", "One might expect Jobs, a biopic of Steve Jobs, to canonize the Apple computer magnate who was only 56 when he died in 2011. But it's a lot more fun than that.", "Those more familiar with this remarkable figure will find the film lacks the depth and complexity of the real Jobs.", "Too often the audience is taken out of the scene with thoughts of\" Hey, isn't that Ashton Kutcher?\" simply because the portrayal comes off too contrived.", "While entertaining, the film doesn't achieve the ultimate goal of Steve Jobs' work: to make the things that matter beautiful and to find beauty in the small moments.", "The opening scene of Jobs, the feeble biopic of the iconic Apple founder, is the one that keeps recurring throughout the film, with varying degrees of hagiographical worship, which is never less than lofty.", "It's just insightful enough, albeit briefly, to be worth your time.", "The critics screwed up on this. It is a much better film than its rating here. Take that from someone who worked in IT for 44 years and who knows the difference between \"fresh\" and \"rotten\".", "The movie is littered with small details of lore that should make Apple fanatics happy.", "A noble but unworthy effort that will likely disappoint viewers looking for a thoughtful look into the technological genius.", "Matt Whiteley's clumsy script attempts to sync Jobs' personal story with the corporate history of his brand but as any affirmed Android/PC users will gladly tell you, syncing with Apple can be problematic at the best of times.", "This movie would be exponentially better if it were called Twenty-Something Jobs or Jobs, Woz And The First 2 Apples.", "Ashton Kutcher does a very fine job as Jobs, portraying him less as a technological wizard and more as a business visionary who realised his out-of-the-box ideas by surrounding himself with people who were admittedly more talented than he was.", "Ashton Kutcher IS Steve Jobs. You have to give Kutcher credit: He studied his character. That he successfully completed his homework is evidenced in 'Jobs,' a biopic of Apple Inc.'s late genius."], "rating": ["2.5/4", "", "5/10", "", "", "", "", "B", "3/5", "D-", "C", "", "3/5", "", "", "1.5/5", "1.5/5", "2.5/5", "3.5/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Amy Taubin", "Bernard Boo", "Nathalia Aryani", "Deborah Krieger", "Jordan Riefe", "Megan Basham", "Stephen Schaefer", "Francesca Rudkin", "Candice Frederick", "John Fink", "Kong Rithdee", "J.
