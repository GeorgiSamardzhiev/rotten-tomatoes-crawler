{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When Civil War veteran John Carter (Taylor Kitsch) mysteriously awakes on the surface of Mars -- also called Barsoom -- he little expects the adventure that awaits him. Carter reluctantly becomes embroiled in an epic conflict among the red planet's inhabitants, including Tars Tarkas (Willem Dafoe) and Princess Dejah Thoris (Lynn Collins). As Barsoom is poised on the brink of collapse, war-weary Carter rediscovers his humanity when he realizes that everyone's fate is in his hands.", "rating": "52", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Horror/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 12m", "director": "Andrew Stanton", "studio": "WaltDisneyStudios", "theater_date": "Mar 9, 2012", "dvd_date": "Nov 23, 2015", "box_office": "$73.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Feels heavily recycled in both its storytelling techniques and its visual effects.", "The battles mostly fail to satisfy, and the film's opening scene is either a misguided mess or simply unnecessary.", "It has the all the things you want out of the big summertime release with adventure, a cool hero, an interesting love interest, and big-time effects.", "All together, John Carter is fun to watch and pretty to look at - just don't expect too much besides that.", "This misunderstood and reverent spectacle was a victim of youthful ignorance more than bad marketing", "...unless you're still looking forward to puberty, you should avoid John Carter.", "As to the best aspects of John Carter, it is first and foremost a joy to watch visually.", "It's the kind of movie that reminds us why we go to the movies, a kind of filmmaking that some may call naive or outdated, but I would call timeless. John Carter is the real deal.", "For the most part, the first \"live action\" feature by Andrew Stanton, is graphically splendiferous and enjoyably nonsensical.", "John Carter has a sense of adventure, a sense of fun and, best of all, a sense of proportion. It's a family-friendly bet that honors its roots and its audience.", "An enjoyable piece of mainstream escapist cinema, its often illogical plot held together by a decent cast, some well-placed Flash Gordon-esque moments of humor and a strict mandate to never take itself too seriously.", "This story is more original than Avatar, but lacks Avatar's elegance.", "While there isn't much new terrain here, what distinguishes Carter is the quality and richness of what they extract from the soil.", "Taylor Kitsch's nipples star in Cowboys & Aliens 2: Electric Boogaloo. On Mars. In 3-D. Yay?", "It's such a soul-sucking, humourless mess of technobabble and gobble-de-gook, I'm pretty sure sitting through it made me a Scientologist or something.", "John Carter isn't completely bad-a lot of individual elements work quite well-but it's a mess and it's so science fictiony as to be alienating.", "As negative-leaning as most of this article is, \"John Carter\" is still fun and offers occasional moments of glory.", "The movie is still one tacky sight.", "Even if Edgar Rice Burroughs' 11-volume series is adapted by its three screenwriters into a nonsensical mess, then it should at least be a visual feast, right?
