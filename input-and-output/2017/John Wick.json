{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Legendary assassin John Wick (Keanu Reeves) retired from his violent career after marrying the love of his life. Her sudden death leaves John in deep mourning. When sadistic mobster Iosef Tarasov (Alfie Allen) and his thugs steal John's prized car and kill the puppy that was a last gift from his wife, John unleashes the remorseless killing machine within and seeks vengeance. Meanwhile, Iosef's father (Michael Nyqvist) -- John's former colleague -- puts a huge bounty on John's head.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Action & Adventure", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Chad Stahelski", "studio": "ThunderRoadPictures,DefyniteFilms,87eleven", "theater_date": "Oct 24, 2014", "dvd_date": "Jun 7, 2016", "box_office": "$43.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Wick is so tough he doesn't bother to take off his blood-soaked shirt when he starts his quest for vengeance and the movie is just as uncompromising.", "Rock music, cold stares, and plenty of bullets emphasize Wick's proficiency, as the plot needs all the help it can get to impart the coolness it desperately wants to exhibit.", "For a dour narrative about death, loss, and violence, it's surprisingly good natured.", "Just when i thought that Keanu Reeves had retired from the action genre, he appears back and in revenge mode with the amazing John Wick. [Full review in Spanish]", "John Wick is the slick, empty, cruel hero the age of Trump deserves - but hey, at least he likes dogs!", "Occasionally ridiculous, it is action-packed, stylish and a return to form for Mr Reeves.", "The script defines an amazing microcosm that surrounds the profession of the protagonist. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Simply put, John Wick is probably one of the best action movies in a decade. From an efficient story to incredible fight sequences and an action start that just doesn't seem to quite, John Wick is as close to perfect as I've ever seen.", "Directed by long-time stuntmen David Leitch and Chad Stahelski, it is exactly the sort of movie you would expect from long-time stuntmen: brutal, close-up fighting, nearly nonstop gunplay and the slightest story legally allowed.", "Why does it work? That's probably a better question. On paper, this movie falls somewhere between Commando and Taken in terms of getting from Point A to Point B, but in execution, John Wick just feels like a special journey.", "Fast, fun, and with care taken on elements outside of the requisite action sequences, it's a film that succeeds in generally conquering the fatigue of its own familiarity.", "John Wick is the sort of mindless movie that you get when you give two long-time stunt men (David Leitch and Chad Stahelski) the directorial reins.", "Once the wick is lit (pun, unfortunately, intended), the candle of vengeance burns for the entirety of the film.", "A perfectly assembled cast and confident direction turn this B-movie thriller into an instant classic.", "John Wick is a lean, mean revenger to go with its ice-cold protagonist. It's not perfect, but you'll be hard pressed to find a more enjoyable action movie this year.", "On paper, there are many elements in this movie's plot which you have seen before in other films. However, directors David Leitch and Chad Stahlelski still manage to weave an entertaining non-stop action film.", "...my truly guilty pleasure of the year.", "An ex-hitman and his dog, who has such a sad plot-line I'm not even going to delve into the question of whether you should give someone a pet as a present. The violence is a murderous ballet, in a compelling underground world of self-contained perfection.", "This movie is great. It is what it is: just an old-school shoot-'em-up revenge flick. The action is incredible, and Reeves is phenomenal.", "John Wick is a fun action spectacle with a pulse-pounding score that is smart enough to cast an actor against type who is committed completely to this abusive insanity."], "rating": ["3.5/5", "4/10", "A", "7/10", "", "3.5/5", "", "9/10", "B", "8/10", "3.5/5", "C", "B-", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "5/5", "7/10", "7/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "Brent McKnight", "Yasser Medina", "Chris McCoy", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Karl Delossantos", "Ryan Syrek", "Dominic Griffin", "Nicholas Bell", "Tom Santilli", "Matt Oakes", "Phil W.
