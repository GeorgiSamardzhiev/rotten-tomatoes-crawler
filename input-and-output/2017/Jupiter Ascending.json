{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Jupiter Jones (Mila Kunis) was born under signs that predicted future greatness, but her reality as a woman consists of cleaning other people's houses and endless bad breaks.

The story is imperfect, yet appropriately complex and satisfying.", "Expect the need to stifle the occasional misplaced giggle.", "Let me have my stupid fun, my wacky fable with winged lizards wearing clothes. I love you, Jupiter Ascending, and I don't care who knows it.", "It's a woeful disappointment from a pair of filmmakers whose narrative strengths used to be on par with their visual interests.", "Jupiter Ascending is several stars short of a constellation. An excess of imagination fails to result in entertainment or narrative cohesion; something went very wrong here.", "Jupiter Ascending is just nutty enough to be entertaining.", "A tiresome sci-fi yarn that cannibalises from so many past fantasy properties that in the future, special 'spot the homage' screenings could be held in its honour.", "Some dumb action flicks can still be entertaining but to add insult to injury, this movie is also quite boring, and the bombastic action/chase scenes just dragged on for far too long.", "Perhaps it is time for the Wachowskis to stop trying to recreate The Matrix."], "rating": ["4/10", "3.0/4", "C-", "C-", "5/10", "", "", "", "", "1/5", "2/5", "7.3/10", "2/5", "A-", "2/5", "2/5", "C+", "2/5", "1.5/5", "C"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "Brent McKnight", "Andrew Galdi", "Pablo Mu\u00f1oz", "Kylie Klein-Nixon", "Avaryl Halley", "Chris McCoy", "David Harris", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Brandon Davis", "Leslie Combemale", "Ryan Syrek", "Nicholas Bell", "Bertie Archer", "Rachel Wagner", "Adam Lowes", "Ruth Maramis", "Micheal Compton"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Stuff.co.nz", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flick Feast", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ComicBook.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Reader (Omaha, NE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">FlixChatter Film Blog", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News"], "date": ["December 4, 2020", "September 13, 2020", "July 16, 2020", "July 6, 2020", "May 27, 2020", "April 29, 2020", "April 13, 2020", "March 26, 2020", "January 9, 2020", "November 27, 2019", "November 19, 2019", "November 12, 2019", "August 2, 2019", "July 30, 2019", "July 18, 2019", "May 17, 2019", "April 30, 2019", "April 4, 2019", "March 5, 2019", "January 24, 2019"]}}
