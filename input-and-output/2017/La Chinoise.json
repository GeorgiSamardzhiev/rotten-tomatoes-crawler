{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This dark French comedy by Jean-Luc Godard focuses on a group of students who have embraced Maoist ideals and strive to incite revolution through terrorist violence. Two of the members, Guillaume (Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud) and V\u00e9ronique (Anne Wiazemsky), are romantically linked, though their relationship is strained by their commitment to the cause. The group eventually plots to assassinate a high-ranking Russian governmental official who is visiting Paris, but things don't go according to plan.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Jean-Luc Godard", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 22, 2018", "box_office": "$5.6K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Its pace, for all the talk, is exhilarating, its use of primary colors hard and beautiful, its shifts of mood and action are both intricate and dazzling; while its feeling for its characters is always serious and affectionate, even when Godard is mocking.", "Deep, rich, profound, [and] overwhelming.", "What has to be made clear is that this is an infuriating but cagy film.", "Only Godard could make a film so theoretical and so waywardly, persistently about people. Only Godard, certainly, could make this film.", "Godard's stylishly assembled depiction of a young Maoist cell in Paris alternately interrogates, skewers and champions the political radicals of its time.", "It's still easy to be wowed by La Chinoise's mastery of ideological back-and-forth as well as the pinwheeling sense of invention that constantly threatens to burst the constrants of the frame", "", "", "Everything in this film seems to be constructed for its central purpose, which is to make you THINK. Sounds like a dare, doesn't it? One of Godard's lesser seen, but nonetheless essential films.", "Relevant at its theater release and when viewed some sixty years later.", "Best for Godard addicts.", "Maybe Andy Warhol didn't make the quintessential Pop Art masterwork.
