Not only are you enchanted by her story, but you also learn something about yourself. [Full review in Spanish]", "There is something for all ages to identify with and you will find yourself torn between the generations, but ultimately feeling great affection for all of the characters. This film is a success because of the exceptional writing from Greta Gerwig.", "[The film] is good, but overrated. Curiously, its faults are also overrated, in that many are characteristic of its genre.", "The way Gerwig captures the stages of adolescence makes this coming-of-age film more honest than poignant. It shows that not only she is a good actress, but also a great filmmaker. [Full review in Spanish]", "Marion and Lady Bird's bond is very real, strong, and complicated like many mother-daughter bonds tend to be.", "Gerwig shows no hesitation over putting her character in unflattering situations. The laughs come hard, they come often, and they come from all directions.", "A stupendously acted and immeasurably poignant ode to the realistic bonds and barbs of life as a high school senior.", "I am awfully fond of it. This film isn't for me, but it doesn't have to be. Someone out there is going to see this film for the first time. Its heartfelt, goofy, and ever-so-slightly twee wavelength will seem to be made just for them...", "Oscar-worthy performances, outstanding direction, great script (so real, raw and emotional) along with tremendous editing...", "Gerwig deftly mines the family dynamics for laughs and emotion, sometimes in the same scene.", "Taking the trip with [Lady Bird] is a joy, and the cast and filmmaker taking us there create a singular, authentic experience that will place Lady Bird on the list of most memorable, enjoyable coming of age films.", "Lady Bird is a generous portrait from a writer/director/actress who knows something about authenticity.", "... just like Lady Bird, Greta Gerwig is a creative force to be reckoned with.", "Writer/Director Greta Gerwig brings her own personal story into play, delivering her Lady Bird with an enthusiastic yet defiant cheekiness, never once losing sight of the real story.", "[Greta] Gerwig captures the feeling of being a high schooler so perfectly that it's nearly impossible to not identify with one of the characters in some way."], "rating": ["6/10", "", "", "4/4", "4.5/5", "", "9/10", "", "7/10", "", "", "5/5", "", "4/4", "", "", "3.5/5", "", "4.5/5", "4.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Dan Buffa", "Matthew St. Clair", "Jason Fraley", "Matt Cipolla", "Ricardo Gallegos", "Fiona Underhill", "CJ Sheu", "Yasser Medina", "Andrea Thompson", "Victor Stiff", "PJ Nabarro", "Tim Brennan", "Sarah Knight Adamson", "Chris McCoy", "Leslie Combemale", "Nicholas Bell", "Linda and Al Lerner", "Kate Rodger", "Karl Delossantos"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KSDK News (St. Louis)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Sentries", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WTOP (Washington, D.C.)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Monthly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">P\u00f3lvora", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">JumpCut Online", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Review Film Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">A Reel of One&#39;s Own", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Goomba Stomp/Tilt Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">About Boulder", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sarah&#39;s Backstage Pass", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies and Shakers", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newshub (NZ)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Smash Cut Reviews"], "date": ["December 5, 2020", "November 6, 2020", "October 9, 2020", "September 3, 2020", "July 23, 2020", "July 3, 2020", "July 2, 2020", "July 1, 2020", "June 27, 2020", "April 21, 2020", "March 30, 2020", "March 30, 2020", "February 21, 2020", "January 28, 2020", "January 16, 2020", "October 18, 2019", "October 10, 2019", "October 3, 2019", "September 16, 2019", "August 5, 2019"]}}
