{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Dodge Connolly (George Clooney), captain of a 1920s football team, wants to give the sagging sport a boost and capture the country's attention. He recruits Carter Rutherford (John Krasinski) to play for the team. Carter is not only a war hero, but he is also fast, handsome, and guaranteed to pack the stands with fans.

A patriotic tribute? A sliver of sports history? It's all those things and more. Alas, more is not necessarily better.", "A slovenly, timid, strenuously studied movie that takes forever to get nowhere, uninterestingly.", "If the likes of His Girl Friday and Ball of Fire are the standards, Leatherheads can be forgiven for falling short.", "", "", "Leatherheads is too light-hearted to rise above its limitations, and its inability to decide on a tone doesn't help any, but it's too well crafted and thought out to be actually bad.", "Clooney stages screwball repartee like a ping-pong match shot through molasses", "Leatherheads tries to be a screwball comedy, but it's more The Eleven Stooges.", "Agreeable yet uneven...", "Mostly simply tries for fun, and for a good part of it, it delivers. But with it's jumble of elements, it doesn't allow a central one to take hold and truly fly.", "Leatherheads really doesn't know what kind of film it is, and as a result it shanks the winning kick -not by a mile- but by enough to be a disappointment.", "A gorgeous, charming, quaintly stylish movie comprised almost exclusively of moments and not so much story or characters.", "Therein lies the problem with Leatherheads %u2014 it has too many fish to fry, and most of them come out half-done.", "This is the slightest of Clooney's directorial offerings, but it's carried over the line by two charismatic leads and a well-honed screenplay.", "Star power is not enough to save this film from mediocrity.", "\"Leatherheads\" fails because it has trouble balancing its many plots, and because it has nothing remotely interesting to say about any of them."], "rating": ["6/10", "C", "2/4", "", "", "", "", "B", "3/5", "7/10", "", "2.0/5", "2.5/4", "6/10", "C", "2.5/5", "2.0/4", "3/5", "2/5", "1.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Micheal Compton", "Matthew Lucas", "Megan Basham", "Marcianne Miller", "Deborah Ross", "Justin Stewart", "Nell Minow", "Dave White", "Joshua Starnes", "Fernando F.
