{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In a future society, time-travel exists, but it's only available to those with the means to pay for it on the black market. When the mob wants to eliminate someone, it sends the target into the past, where a hit man known as a looper lies in wait to finish the job. Joe (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is one such hired gun, and he does his job well -- until the day his bosses decide to \"close the loop\" and send Joe's future self (Bruce Willis) back in time to be killed.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "Rian Johnson", "studio": "RamBergman", "theater_date": "Sep 28, 2012", "dvd_date": "Sep 1, 2014", "box_office": "$66.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The action, drama, suspense, and performances are all entertaining, but at the end, it's impossible not to come back to the faults in the film's time travel foundation.", "Easily One of 2012's Best Sci-Fi Flicks.", "Fantastic performances, big ideas, and the ability to pull off a slick narrative juggling act.", "This is the kind of science fiction that can be seen multiple times. [Full review in Spanish]", "If you pick too much around the edges of LOOPER, it will inevitably fray slightly, as do many intricate time travel yarns. However, LOOPER is a layered and intelligent neo-noir science fiction with some striking images and emotional resonance.", "Complex, entertaining yet brimming with intelligence, Looper needs to be watched - easily one of the smartest films this year.", "Rian Johnson, director of Brick and The Brothers Bloom, has bit off a big honkin' chunk of sci-fi mythology with Looper.", "A mind-bending bit of science-fiction entertainment -- a trippy piece of cinema with an equal mix of style and substance.", "A very original sci-film with a creative premise and story.", "Looper embraces the paradox that's required for the two-Joes story to even happen, knotting improbability, vengeance and the notion of choice into a taut, sleek, imperfect but intelligent action movie.", "For all its promise, Looper is a true film of two parts (halves wouldn't be quite accurate in terms of narrative focus) -- with the second, ultimately, a jumbled genre-clash of misfires and missteps.", "Looper is solid in performance, action and effect, with some admirable surprises along the way and at the end.", "[Writer-director Rian Johnson] is one of the most stylish young filmmakers working today.", "While this latest time-travel movie isn't perfect, it is a thought- provoking, intelligent story with heart.", "Films like Looper are the reason spoiler tags were invented. This is a film that demands to be seen cold and discussed later.", "Some may try to nitpick the film to death ... but look past the little details and you'll find a film that, as a whole, is both fun and thought provoking.", "Looper may not be something Christian moviegoers want to expose themselves to, but it should hearten us to know that young, influential filmmakers like Johnson are wrestling with these questions in such well-done movies.", "There isn't one wasted moment or word.", "A breath of fresh air as we creep into the heavy fall dramas and awards glitz, Looper will likely not be forgotten as the film that showed up and got the job done.", "Great set-up.
