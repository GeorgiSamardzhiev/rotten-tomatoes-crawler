{"metadata": {"synopsis": "New York high-school student Lisa Cohen (Anna Paquin) inadvertently causes an accident in which a bus driver (Mark Ruffalo) runs over a pedestrian (Allison Janney). Guilt-stricken over her role in the woman's death, Lisa's mood swings from normal to furious, with her angry outbursts mostly directed at her mother (J. Smith-Cameron). Lisa reaches out to the dead woman's best friend (Jeannie Berlin) and the bus driver, but her failed efforts to make amends only lead to more hostility.", "rating": "74", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 29m", "director": "Kenneth Lonergan", "studio": "CamelotPictures,FoxSearchlight,ScottRudinProductions,MirageEnterprises", "theater_date": "Sep 30, 2011", "dvd_date": "Feb 1, 2014", "box_office": "$46.5K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["I highly recommend investing in the extended cut of this important drama.

Still, like its young protagonist, sometimes it comes off as a bit too self-righteous and self-involved.", "Let's hope [Director Kenneth] Longeran's next film doesn't take over a decade to appear -- and that he learns where his real talents lie.", "So contrived and ham-handed that its successes are mostly drowned in its failures.", "From its majestic slo-mo opening shots of New York City pedestrians to its devastating closing moments at the Met, \"Margaret\" enthralls like no other...This smart, literate urban opera is well deserving of a standing ovation.", "In Margaret, everyone has her own opera.", "\"Margaret\" not only faithfully captures a young woman's growing pains, it also serves as an emblem for our collective post-9/11 grieving process.", "This movie may be a lot of things, but finished isn't one of them.", "Knotty, ambitious and trading in messy human truths, it's the work of a master dramatist. Here's hoping Lonergan's next one reaches us a little faster.", "A messy-yet-poignant dramatic opera about the power of regret, loss, and worst of all, being a teenager.", "If two and a half hours in the company of quarrelsome, self-absorbed New Yorkers don't sound too punishing, there's much to like.", "It has failings, but they're not fundamental, and if anything they speak to just how much Lonergan tried to coerce into a single story. He was aiming for ecstatic transcendence.", "Lonergan's brainy script wouldn't work without Paquin, who makes Lisa a force of nature. As a walking paradox -- both controlling and completely out of control -- she's riveting.", "Margaret's journey to the screen may've been rocky, but the result is a singularly compelling study of trauma. It's a raw, messily magnificent near-masterpiece.", "Margaret is less about plot mechanics than about the virtuosity of the dialogue, the complexity of the characters, and the detail and depth of their untidy world.", "At 150 minutes, it's way too long, with several superfluous scenes and subplots. On top of all that, moments of high melodrama and overwrought opera suggest that it has an over-inflated sense of its own importance.", "Complex, ambitious, remarkably performed; Margaret is a unique film that almost didn't see the light of day.", "Margaret is a frayed-nerves feat of furious articulation."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "8/10", "B", "2/4", "", "4/4", "", "", "", "4/5", "B+", "3/5", "3.5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "2/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Ed Travis", "Josh Larsen", "Sarah Boslaugh", "Abbie Bernstein", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Pat Padua", "Rub\u00e9n Rosario", "Robert Koehler", "Martin Tsai", "Sean Burns", "Guy Lodge", "Jack Giroux", "Neil Smith", "Craig Mathieson", "Susan G.
