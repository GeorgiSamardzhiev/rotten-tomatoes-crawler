{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Tripper (Bill Murray) is the head counselor at a budget summer camp called Camp Northstar. In truth, he's young at heart and only marginally more mature than the campers themselves. Tripper befriends Rudy (Chris Makepeace), a loner camper who has trouble fitting in. As Tripper inspires his young charges to defeat rival Camp Mohawk in the annual Olympiad competition, Rudy plays matchmaker between Tripper and Roxanne (Kate Lynch), a female counselor at Northstar.", "rating": "72", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Ivan Reitman", "studio": "ParamountPictures,CFDC,FamousPlayers", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 19, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...while Meatballs is not a very good movie, you still kind of wish you could have gone to Camp North Star as a camper.", "Amusing in an antiquated way? Perhaps. But funny? No.", "If one or two fall flat, so what. The next probably will hit your funnybone.", "I can't really say Meatballs is a great film, it's a silly, stupid summer movie, and sometimes, that's exactly what you need.", "For those of you that are big fans of the cult comedy hit Wet Hot American Summer, Meatballs is the summer camp movie it parodied the most, even though Meatballs had a bigger heart and was strictly PG.", "It's Murray's spontaneity that gives the movie its lifeblood. But Murray also shows an early, rare example of onscreen tenderness.", "The scenes between Murray and Makepeace are nicely handled, and the lack of mean-spiritedness is refreshing.", "A bit slow and meandering, and unfunny when Bill Murray is not on screen, but Meatballs is worth it for the camp atmosphere and Murray's comic genius.", "Through it all, Murray smiles and forges ahead, but his big riffs have been edited down to frantic bursts of mugging.", "It doesn't get any funnier than Meatballs!", "As easy to handle as drinking lemonade under a shady tree.", "Bill Murray is the only reason to see this film. His high energy and sensitive acting abilities take this cliche film out of the ordinary and give it the style that did not appear in the script or the direction.", "It's difficult to come up with a more cliche situation for a summer pic than a summer camp, where all the characters and plot turns are readily imaginable. That makes director Ivan Reitman's accomplishment all the more noteworthy.", "...ultimately just not able to live up to its inexplicable reputation as a minor cult classic.", "Murray has been funnier and far more authoritative during his career, but he was never this joyfully floppy again. Meatballs is the crowning of his doofus glory and a great testament to his once improvisational appeal.", "you don't mind the lack of structure, especially since it's delivered by a good-natured and good-humored young cast", "Camp counsellor Tripper (Murray) is a John Belushi clone whose 'charisma' dominates the film's standard wackiness and sentimental story (of a kid who doesn't fit).", "", "", "It's a classic, but not as good as you might remember."], "rating": ["", "5/10", "", "", "2.5/4", "3/5", "2.5/4", "7/10", "", "3/5", "B-", "1.5/4", "", "2/4", "B+", "4/5", "", "3/5", "2/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Ed Travis", "Nathanael Hood", "Yardena Arar", "Dorothy Woodend", "Eric Melin", "Jeffrey M.
