{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When luckless dreamer Melvin Dummar (Paul Le Mat) rescues a grizzled, half-dead man (Jason Robards) from the desert, he's skeptical of the man's claim that he's actually reclusive billionaire Howard Hughes. But in the wake of Hughes' death a decade later, a will appears naming Melvin the recipient of $156 million, and a media circus ensues. Accused of forgery, Melvin vigorously maintains his innocence despite a strong intuition that he'll never see any of the money.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Jonathan Demme", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 9, 2004", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Tak Fujimoto's photography and Craig McKay's editing are without fault.", "Hypnotic shots of asphalt echo Two-Lane Blacktop, Easy Rider and other American road movies while forging its own human path - not of counterculture, but of connection.", "Affectionately good-humoured as much of the observation is... the film's eye is, if never savage, then sometimes at least moderately scathing.", "Everything is all right really -- it tells us -- as long as there are good guys like Melvin to add a little human decency and a touch of naive fun to the great game show of life. I found this melancholy, however, rather than inspiring.", "Shambling yet delicate, Demme's screwball tall tale gazes at TV contests and novelty ballads and sees not derisive kitsch but the warm connective tissue of human yearning", "A limp biopic with wooden performances and an uninteresting premise.", "The most engaging portrayal of Howard Hughes on film is not by Howard Hughes -- it's by Jason Robards, Jr. in Melvin and Howard.", "Some great, reverberant moments.", "The film offers a bittersweet commentary about chasing the American Dream of monetary success abd mobility and the constant attempt to rise above one's situation by naive and optimistic charcaters, not fully aware of their class limitations.", "Delightful in the affection it shows for its characters.", "", "", "Robards is a chillingly effective Hughes.
