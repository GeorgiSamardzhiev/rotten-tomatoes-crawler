{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Ex-presidents Kramer (Jack Lemmon) and Douglas (James Garner) have hated each other for years. But when the current administration of President Haney (Dan Aykroyd) -- Kramer's former vice president -- tries blaming a string of kickbacks from a defense contractor on the two former presidents, they band together. With Haney's goons trying to kill them, they set out across the country to try and clear their reputations. In the process, they see a side of America they never knew before.", "rating": "47", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Peter Segal", "studio": "PetersEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 25, 2014", "box_office": "$22.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["With two of the screen's best comedic actors, a script that crackles with wit and surprise, and perfectly tuned direction, My Fellow Americans scores a bull's-eye.", "My Fellow Americans certainly holds up after several presidential administrations but the film could definitely be better.", "The humor is clearly of the lowbrow variety, but Lemmon and Garner handle their lines with the conviction of Royal Shakespeare Company members tackling Macbeth.", "If My Fellow Americans had ever decided which movie it wanted to be, it might have been pretty good. As it is, the good half and the bad half all but cancel each other out.", "Using talent of this order on a script this weak, along with merely decorative appearances by the likes of Lauren Bacall and Wilford Brimley, amounts to the Hollywood equivalent of government waste.", "If only movies could be impeached.", "Mostly, My Fellow Americans is solidly written, offbeat entertainment well-served by the fine leads, clever casting of supporting roles and a script that holds together, even through a less-than-stellar finale.", "As political satire, My Fellow Americans makes a poor candidate.", "The surprise of this comedy... is how sharply written it is -- almost sharply enough to overcome the crude direction that grotesquely overemphasizes the picture's inevitable sentimental interludes.", "Yes, it's Grumpy Old Presidents, in which most of the comedy comes from the supposed shock of hearing two senior citizens cursing at each other in terms Beavis and Butt-head would find inelegant.", "I'd cheerfully vote the writers, director and producers of My Fellow Americans out of office.", "Okay, so it's Midnight Run meets All The President's Men, but the Lemmon-Garner rapport is dynamite and the glittering support cast of Lauren Bacall, Dan Aykroyd and John Heard are given sparkling dialogue.", "The movie suggests we get the government we deserve, but do we really deserve this movie?", "It takes a special actor's grace to survive a script as lame as My Fellow Americans, and James Garner has it. Without appearing to break a sweat, Garner makes each grotesquely desperate attempt at humor look smooth and assured.", "An appalling piece of junk.", "Peter Segal's comedy has a few witty moments surrounded by a lot of silliness.", "Garner and Jack Lemmon have enough charisma, and there are enough solid laughs, to mostly overcome My Fellow Americans' embarrassing moments and improbable ending.", "Enthusiastic as one might be that Jack Lemmon has found a new lease on movie life with his Grumpy Old Men series, the funny-crankpots genre wears mighty thin on this road trip.", "", "Strained and obvious political comedy that wastes some really great actors."], "rating": ["", "3.5/5", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "2/4", "1/4", "", "2/5", "2/4", "2/4", "", "4/5", "2/4", "2/4", "", "", "", "C-", "1/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Bob Thomas", "Danielle Solzman", "Matt Brunson", "Stephen Hunter", "Desmond Ryan", "Gary Thompson", "Roger Hurlburt", "Jay Boyar", "", "Dave Kehr", "Joe Morgenstern", "Jake Hamilton", "Michael Wilmington", "John Hartl", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "David Sterritt", "Stephen Thompson", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Emanuel Levy", "Scott Weinberg"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Solzy at the Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">eFilmCritic.com"], "date": ["August 7, 2019", "February 22, 2019", "July 24, 2016", "October 22, 2013", "October 22, 2013", "October 22, 2013", "October 22, 2013", "October 22, 2013", "October 22, 2013", "October 22, 2013", "October 22, 2013", "October 22, 2013", "October 22, 2013", "October 22, 2013", "October 22, 2013", "October 22, 2013", "October 22, 2013", "September 7, 2011", "June 27, 2005", "April 3, 2005"]}}
