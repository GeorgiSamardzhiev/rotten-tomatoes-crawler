{"metadata": {"synopsis": "An aging James Bond (Sean Connery) makes an uncharacteristic mistake during a routine training mission, leading M (Edward Fox) to believe that the legendary British Intelligence spy is now past his prime. M indefinitely suspends Bond from active duty. However, when SPECTRE member Fatima Bush (Barbara Carrera) and her fellow terrorists successfully steal two nuclear missiles from the U.S. military, M must reinstate Bond, as he is the only agent who can beat SPECTRE at their own game of espionage.", "rating": "67", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 17m", "director": "Irvin Kershner", "studio": "EonProductionsLtd.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 1, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It may be Bond, but without the use of the gun barrel graphics, the booming theme music, and the opening title silhouettes of nude figures, it just doesn't feel the same.", "Adding together a marvellous array of sophistication, comedy and action. Never Say Never Again is superb entertainment.", "Overall I liked Never Say Never Again but it fell far short of the movie it could have been. The makers should have been more adventurous instead of simply trying to beat Broccoli at his own game.", "Everything is more implausible and entertaining, even though the structure is the same. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Superior to 'Octopussy', it shows that Connery is, for the moment, the actor who best treated the character, the only one who even took it seriously, possessed the necessary humor to make us laugh at him. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Essentially, it's a remake of the less successful Thunderball, also with Connery. but Never Say Never Again, in the original Bond spirit, concentrates on the people rather than the gadgets -- at least for the first half.", "If you haven't seen 'Thunderball,' this is a lot more enjoyable, but matched up against one of the more exciting 007 films, 'Never Say Never' fails to do it better.", "Never Say Never Again is the best acted Bond picture ever made, because it clearly surpasses any predecessors in the area of inventive and clever character delineation.", "It's not a rap against Roger Moore to say that this film seems to bring James Bond back to life. Sean Connery did, after all, define the character.", "Sean Connery is still up to par as James Bond in the latest adventure of Agent 007.", "The plot, which owes much to Thunderball, lurches badly at times, but the wild action set pieces, decked out in gals, gadgets and glib lines, are there to be cherished.", "A fitting farewell to 007's most enduring embodiment: as much a playful send-up as a loving final embrace.", "Can we just consider 1983 a lost year for James Bond? First, \"Octopussy,\" then Sean Connery's return in a depressing dilution of the 007 brand - one that ends with a fourth wall-breaking wink indicative less of arch fun, more of bored indifference.", "I know Bond fans were furious about this movie cause it wasn't an Eon production, and I think they're wrong. They should be furious at it because it's a horrendous film.", "The slick production values impress and Barbara Carrera and Klaus Maria Brandauer are good value villains, but Irvin Kershner appears to have nodded off in the director's chair.", "In Never Say Never Again, the formula is broadened to accommodate an older, seasoned man of much greater stature, and Mr. Connery expertly fills the bill.", "An ugly, unwanted epilogue [to Connery's Bond], in which the character who was so iconic and perfect is reduced to a self-conscious joke.", "There is a special place in movie hell for Never Say Never Again. Not that it's particularly bad -- though it's hardly good -- but because it's such a cheeseball experience with a strange and horrible pedigree.", "Connery proved plenty fit for one more outing...a likeable but somewhat mediocre adventure handsomely mounted in the traditional Bond style...[Blu-ray]", "It's an aging and unenthusiastic Connery who returns to play Bond, who doesn't have the physicality to do justice any more to the demanding muscular role."], "rating": ["2/10", "", "", "", "", "", "6/10", "", "", "", "3/5", "B", "2/5", "1/4", "2/5", "", "4/10", "2/5", "2.5/4", "B-"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Holliss", "John Brosnan", "Diego Gal\u00e1n", "Alberto Abu\u00edn", "Roxanne T.
