{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Cantankerous retiree Norman Thayer (Henry Fonda) and his conciliatory wife, Ethel (Katharine Hepburn), spend summers at their New England vacation home on the shores of idyllic Golden Pond.

[Full Review in Spanish]", "On Golden Pond is a rare and beautiful movie, radiating with humanity. Ernest Thompson has adroitly adapted his successful play to the screen, adding pictorial scope without sacrificing the human interplay.", "The truth of its characters and emotions carry the film from start to finish.", "There is a natural rhythm to the film that makes its own quiet, life-affirming statement.", "When it sometimes seems the whole society has spiritually decamped for Tinseltown, the movie offers the hope that people can come home again-at least for a visit.", "Valuable lessons in loving one's family members.", "", "Fonda was 75 when this picture was made and must have known he didn't have much time. There could have been no finer final curtain for him than this.", "What saves it is the truly extraordinary performances.", "This family melodrama about aging, mortality, and reconciliation is more significant as a social than artistic event: It's the only teaming of Henry Fonda (who won an Oscar) with daughter Jane (who produced it for him) and also with screen icon Hepburn.", "Two of Hollywood's best-loved veterans deserved a far better swan song than this sticky confection.", "", "", "Wonderful to get one last sweet visit with Mr. Fonda and Ms. Hepburn.", "Stellar cast in left field family values classic.", "Watching the movie, I felt I was witnessing something rare and valuable.", "On Golden Pond is a mixed blessing, but it offers one performance of rare quality and three others that are very good.
