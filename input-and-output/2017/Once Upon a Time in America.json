{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1968, the elderly David \"Noodles\" Aaronson (Robert De Niro) returns to New York, where he had a career in the criminal underground in the '20s and '30s. Most of his old friends, like longtime partner Max (James Woods), are long gone, yet he feels his past is unresolved. Told in flashbacks, the film follows Noodles from a tough kid in a Jewish slum in New York's Lower East Side, through his rise to bootlegger and then Mafia boss -- a journey marked by violence, betrayal and remorse.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 19m", "director": "Sergio Leone", "studio": "WarnerBrothers,EmbassyInternationalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 12, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["...an epic of blinkered nostalgia.", "The cinematographic style has evolved, but it's still unmistakably reminiscent of his earlier projects.", "A stratosphere-scraping citadel of cinema, nearly everything about Leone's last film - and greatest masterwork - speaks to the grand illusion of the American Dream.", "The movie's four hours long, but no one had the time to write a single real character.", "Complex gangster epic has strong violence, sex.", "This would-be epic schlep, dragging almost 50 years of chronology over a sluggish 140 minutes, is far too slight of text and ponderous of presentation to sustain more than nodding-off dramatic interest.", "Adding 22 minutes only enhances Leone's brilliant saga of guilt and betrayal", "A tale of haunting introspection, unremitting power and potent symbolism. \"America\" ruminates on the corrosive effects of greed, violence, objectification and pain, and forces us to face despicable acts of a stand-in for our nation's worst impulses.", "While Sergio Leone's \"Once Upon a Time in America\" is not quite the masterpiece that some make it out to be due to its excess, there are still plenty of things to recommend about it.", "The film, photographed by Tonino Delli Colli, is striking to look at, especially its New York street scenes, which were shot in Manhattan, Montreal and a back lot near Rome. The acting is stunning.", "Just gasp at the scale, at the immaculate period reconstruction and at that incredible opening with its endlessly ringing phone.", "A striking tale of loyalty, love, friendship and ambition, Once Upon A Time is a work of technical beauty and sombre emotion.", "Sergio Leone explores the seamiest byways of urban Americana through the story of two gangsters who start their partnership as Brooklyn kids in 1921 and tragically end it in the late '60s.", "A work of tremendous intellectual depth and emotional range", "Here was a filmmaker who specialized in pure, blistering images, and this operatic earthiness just doesn't play as well as the horrifying, salacious stuff.", "Sergio Leone's languid, lovely and lengthy ode to Lower East Side mobsters (more specifically, mobster films) ...", "Sad and vast yet compelling throughout, this remain Leone's most towering achievement.", "Handsomely mounted beyond a shadow of a doubt, but as the final statement in Leone's career, it mostly makes me think of how fantastic his Westerns were.", "Leone is less interested in arousing an audience's easier emotions than in presenting, at a dispassionate distance, the horror of two men warily walking toward each other on a tightrope suspended above the snake pit of their , deepest compulsions.", "Every gesture is immediate, and every gesture seems eternal."], "rating": ["3/4", "7/10", "", "", "5/5", "", "4/4", "5/5", "3.5/5", "", "5/5", "4/5", "", "8", "2.5/4", "4/5", "5/5", "7/10", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Josh Larsen", "Mike Massie", "Dom Nero", "Paul Attanasio", "Jeffrey M.
