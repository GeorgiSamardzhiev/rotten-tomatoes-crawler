{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Real-life father and daughter Ryan and Tatum O'Neal team up as slick con-artists Moses Pray and Addie Loggins in 1930s Kansas. When \"Moze\" is unexpectedly saddled with getting the 9-year-old Addie to relatives in Missouri after the death of her mother, his attempt to dupe her out of her money backfires, and he's forced to take her on as a partner. Swindling their way through farm country, the pair is nearly done in by a burlesque dancer (Madeline Kahn) and an angry bootlegger.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Peter Bogdanovich", "studio": "ParamountPictures,TheDirectorsCompany,SaticoyProductions", "theater_date": "May 9, 1973", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["[Paper Moon] is exactly what we have in mind when we talk nostalgically of what movies \"used to be\"--meaningful rather than metaphorical, engrossing rather than exploitative, humanistic in their comedy and their sentiment.", "O'Neal leaves a continent-sized impact crater in the center of the film, delivering an instantly iconic performance none have been able to replicate.", "Peter Bogdanovich, using all of the hootchie-kootchie at his command, plus Ryan O'Neal, and even more importantly, O'Neal's nine year old daughter Tatum, has made an ingratiating comedy.", "Shot in black and white by the versatile cinematographer Laszlo Kovacs, this has a mix of folksiness and precise craft that anticipates the Coen brothers, aiming to charm and succeeding.", "Sweet, playful, reverberant - this is a perfect movie.", "Part of an incredible 1970s career run for the director Peter Bogdanovich, Paper Moon remains a high point, not just for the talent involved behind the scenes and in front of the camera, but also for Hollywood.", "From its opening monochrome close-up of nine-year-old Addie Loggins at the barely attended outdoor funeral of her mother, Peter Bogdanovich's Depression-era road movie Paper Moon (1973) is dominated by the presence of Tatum O'Neal.", "A cute little family drama about a young con artist and her father as they build a grifting empire.", "What's most interesting about Paper Moon is that it has the tone and timbre of a comedy, but the setting and style of the film are somber and more reminiscent of a European art film.", "Tatum O'Neal's smoke- and booze-filled caper.", "It is very fussy about period detail, and goes to some length to evoke the dim days of Depression America, while just about everything else is left to slide.", "Bogdanovich's warmest film, featuring charming performances from real-life father and daughter Ryan and Tatum O'Neal.", "It's everything a road picture is supposed to be, a life-changing personal journey, a quest, a bit old-fashioned and a hoot.", "Tatum O'Neal makes a sensational screen debut.", "", "Charming Depression-era road movie comedy.", "A charming mixture of Hawksian comedy and Fordian lyricism.", "Like Bogdanovich's masterpiece, Last Picture Show, this film is at once an evocation of childhood in a specific time and place (story is inspired by a Shirley Temple vehicle) and a commentary on it.
