{"metadata": {"synopsis": "During World War I, commanding officer General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) orders his subordinate, General Mireau (George Macready), to attack a German trench position, offering a promotion as an incentive. Though the mission is foolhardy to the point of suicide, Mireau commands his own subordinate, Colonel Dax (Kirk Douglas), to plan the attack. When it ends in disaster, General Mireau demands the court-martial of three random soldiers in order to save face.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 26m", "director": "Stanley Kubrick", "studio": "BrynaProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 10, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An eye-opening, thought-provoking, powerful war picture that isn't so much anti-war as it is anti-politics, anti-corruption, and anti-authoritarianism.", "Paths of Glory is something like an invitation to disobedience, to mistrust those who are in a position of authority. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Customers impatient of anything but escapist entertainment on the screen may be harshly jolted by this bleak and powerful antimilitarism drama. For less narrow viewers, it s a picture that should not be missed.", "What elevates Paths of Glory above and beyond the standard war film (despite Kubrick's keen direction) is its final moments.", "Paths of Glory is a classic for a reason.", "The strong, decidedly unconventional conclusion confirms Paths of Glory's place as a fairly striking drama from Kubrick...", "High on tension, low on fat and fully deserving of its reputation as one of the finest war films ever made.", "Those who are used to 2001: A Space Odyssey or A Clockwork Orange will initially find this black-and-white First World War drama starring Kirk Douglas rather traditional, until its radical content is revealed.", "Classic Kubrick film with complex, heavy, anti-war themes.", "A reminder both of [Kubrick's] extraordinary formal virtuosity and his powers as a satirist.", "Kirk Douglas and Timothy Carey are outstanding among the troops on the front line, while Kubrick's relentlessly probing camera offers constant evidence of a film-maker at the height of his powers.", "It is arguably the best film about the first world war, and still has a reasonable claim to being Stanley Kubrick's best film.", "Some kind of corrupted masterpiece.", "The scenes of trench warfare are frighteningly vivid, and Kirk Douglas gives a searing performance as the officer assigned to the hopeless task of defending the three men.", "More than 20 years after Mr. Cobb's novel was first published, Mr. Kubrick reminded us that human folly is rarely checked for long. A half-century on, he is still right.", "Kirk Douglas gives one of his finest performances as the intelligent and courageous Col. Dax.", "You can sense Kubrick stretching his cinematic wings in this prime slice of Hollywood liberalism.", "The sardonic rhetoric may be laid on a little heavily at times, but the movie is blunt and scornfully brilliant.", "profound, poignant, and eloquent", "Stanley Kubrick often spoke out against war in his film, using violence as a weapon against the audience's sensibilities.
