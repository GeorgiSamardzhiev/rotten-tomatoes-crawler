{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When his wife dies, Lassefar (Max von Sydow) takes his 12-year-old son, Pelle (Pelle Hvenegaard), from their home in Sweden to Denmark in search of a better life. Signing on as laborers at a large farm, father and son undergo numerous trials, including prejudice against immigrants and run-ins with those more powerful than themselves in both the physical and the social sense. Over the course of a year, young Pelle learns what it takes to survive in a harsh and unforgiving world.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "2h 40m", "director": "Bille August", "studio": "PerHolstFilmproduktion", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 27, 2016", "box_office": "$8.7K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There's a seemingly endless number of characters to explore here, but Pelle the Conqueror always brings us back to the father-son dynamic that is a constant source of both compassion and heartfelt disappointment.", "As Lasse, Max von Sydow brings his supremely accomplished acting to the role.", "Director Bille August and ace Scandinavian cameraman Per Holst make the film a visual treat.", "Pelle itself, rather surprisingly, is a natural, organic epic, and one that opens a window on a meticulously detailed bygone world that, by film's end, you might feel as though you've visited.", "The film is a towering achievement, grueling in its portrayal of a harsh existence yet ultimately an exhilarating experience unlikely to be forgotten.", "Director Bille August's adaptation of the first part of Nobel Prize winner Martin Andersen Nexo's four-volume novel is genuine life-affirming drama.", "The movie -- ravishingly photographed by Jorgen (Elvira Madigan) Persson -- dazzles with incident but fails to find the human focus to validate a lasting claim on the heart.", "Without Max Von Sydow's central performance this would be a commendable, if not particularly subtle piece of filmmaking. With it, it's something very special.", "Beneath the transparent, by-the-numbers schema there are potent elements at play in this work, but unfortunately they go unexplored.", "The chilly, oppressive Danish film Pelle the Conqueror has only one artistic aim: to wrench as much pity as possible from its audience.", "Written and directed by Bille August, Pelle the Conqueror is peopled with the sort of vivid minor characters that lodge in your consciousness.", "This is an often brutal tale which is boosted by a powerful performance from Von Sydow.", "Pelle the Conqueror is a feature film of epic proportions and a relentlessly unsentimental look at life among the haves and, primarily, the have-nots on a big turn-of-the-century farm.", "Von Sydow towers above the rest of the cast with an immensely moving, tender depiction of a man cowed by age and servitude.", "", "", "Von Sydow was better in Strange Brew, but still rather sweet.", "", "", ""], "rating": ["", "", "3/5", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "1/4", "2/4", "", "3/5", "", "", "4/5", "5/5", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Steven Prokopy", "Diane Carson", "Kim Newman", "Michael Atkinson", "Kevin Thomas", "Tom Hutchinson", "Peter Travers", "Sam Jordison", "Kurt Jacobsen", "Dave Kehr", "Jay Boyar", "", "Variety Staff", "Colette Maude", "Cole Smithey", "Emanuel Levy", "Gregory Weinkauf", "Robin Clifford", "Carol Cling", "James O&#39;Ehley"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Third Coast Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KDHX (St. Louis)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Village Voice", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reeling Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Las Vegas Review-Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sci-Fi Movie Page"], "date": ["May 6, 2020", "August 29, 2017", "February 27, 2017", "February 27, 2017", "February 27, 2017", "February 27, 2017", "February 27, 2017", "February 27, 2017", "February 27, 2017", "February 27, 2017", "February 27, 2017", "February 27, 2017", "March 26, 2009", "June 24, 2006", "October 10, 2005", "July 19, 2005", "March 1, 2005", "November 19, 2004", "April 30, 2004", "June 30, 2003"]}}
