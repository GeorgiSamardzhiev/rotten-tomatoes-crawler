{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1952, Irish teenager Philomena (Judi Dench) became pregnant out of wedlock and was sent to a convent. When her baby, Anthony, was a toddler, the nuns took Philomena's child away from her and put him up for adoption in the United States. For the next 50 years, she searched tirelessly for her son. When former BBC correspondent Martin Sixsmith (Steve Coogan) learns of the story, he becomes her ally. They travel together to America to find Anthony and become unexpectedly close in the process.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Stephen Frears", "studio": "BabyCowProductions,MagnoliaMae", "theater_date": "Nov 22, 2013", "dvd_date": "Dec 16, 2016", "box_office": "$37.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Transcends its roots as a class study, becoming instead a poignant and funny story of forgiveness and the true nature of love.", "It's a brooding mystery that focuses more on studying characters than unearthing clues.", "It features a deeply felt and gripping performance from Judi Dench.", "Besides Dench's fierce eyes, the most interesting part of Philomena is watching the picture of the lost son unfold as the buddy-cop pairing of Dench and Coogan ferret out his life story.", "[A] story that took a lifetime, will now touch your heart for a lifetime.", "It's intelligently written and genuinely performed, even if the film is rather visually banal.", "Philomena is kind of a tough sell. It's not a feel-good holiday picture or a tour-de-force acting showcase destined to be christened with Oscar kisses. All the movie has to offer is the fact that it's really, really good.", "Director Stephen Frears overplays his hand occasionally, but the film is balanced by some fine performances and a delicate script by Coogan.", "Surprisingly harrowing at times, the film avoids becoming an overwrought melodrama through the balance in characterisation between Martin's cynicism and Philomena's faith.", "Ultimately, Philomena is a film about faith, family and and forgiveness, making it perfect holiday viewing.", "The film's tone is bittersweet, with Philomena's deep-seated regret propelling the duo's journey forward at a gentle glide.", "Philomena is another Oscar-nominated film which features an older woman, and it left me frustrated...", "Give Dame Judi the damn Oscar", "Dench is undoubtedly Philomena's shining light, pouring warmth and heart into the film's remorse-racked heroine. Unfortunately, however, neither Coogan nor his script prove anything like her equals.", "Because the tale is so inherently emotional with its subject matter, all you need is a competent director and a couple of crack actors to wheedle that trajectory out.", "Philomena encompasses so much so adroitly -- it really is a remarkable story -- that we can admire its structure as a film, even as we absorb its sometimes startling facts and as we truly feel for its people.", "The humor is forced and awkward, and the film struggles with the message it is trying to send.", "It is quiet, restrained, unfussy, and has, at its heart, an injustice so grave it will make your blood boil. You will also cry.", "Bittersweet and smart, Philomena is a character piece that carefully weaves in ugly parts of American and Irish history, a story that's as much about hatred and misused power as it is about faith and forgiveness.", "Philomena is the surprise hit of the season."], "rating": ["4/5", "8/10", "2.5/4", "", "", "3.5/5", "A", "3/4", "3/5", "8/10", "7.4/10", "", "", "2/5", "3/5", "B+", "5/10", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Chris McCoy", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Nicholas Bell", "Ryan Syrek", "Matthew Lucas", "Chris Davies", "Julie Crawford", "Bernard Boo", "Ren Jender", "Nico Hines", "Daniel Green", "PJ Nabarro", "Abbie Bernstein", "Debbie Baldwin", "Deborah Ross", "Molly Templeton", "Leah Sydney"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Reader (Omaha, NE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">North Shore News (Vancouver, B.C.)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Way Too Indie", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bitch Flicks", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Daily Beast", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patrick Nabarro", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Assignment X", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Ladue News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Eugene Weekly (OR)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Showbiz 411"], "date": ["February 1, 2021", "December 4, 2020", "September 20, 2020", "January 8, 2020", "January 7, 2020", "August 29, 2019", "August 27, 2019", "July 4, 2019", "June 7, 2019", "April 17, 2019", "April 9, 2019", "March 14, 2019", "March 6, 2019", "March 6, 2019", "February 1, 2019", "January 19, 2019", "November 3, 2018", "September 5, 2018", "August 28, 2018", "June 22, 2018"]}}
