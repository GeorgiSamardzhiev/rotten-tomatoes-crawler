{"metadata": {"synopsis": "It's been three years since the Barden Bellas (Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson) became the first all-female group to win a national title. All seems well until a botched Lincoln Center performance for the president leads to a scandal that strips them of their performing duties, causing internal tension and strife. With the world championships on the horizon in Copenhagen, Denmark, the women must get their act together for their one and only shot at redemption.", "rating": "65", "genre": "Comedy/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Elizabeth Banks", "studio": "GoldCircleFilms", "theater_date": "May 15, 2015", "dvd_date": "May 23, 2016", "box_office": "$183.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Another fun and wild romp with the Barden Bellas.", "Very much a fans-only affair.", "Anna Kendrick once again impresses vocally and with the depth of her performance.", "The DNA of the first film is still there, but the lightning in the bottle has faded. This is a looser story, with a narrative that meanders around in tangents and unnecessary side plots.", "More a collection of funny moments and musical performances strung together than a coherent narrative, Pitch Perfect 2 should still satisfy fans of the first film.", "It's basically the \"Hangover 2\" of a cappella movies.", "I didn't like this movie. I found it rather offensive, pretty upsetting, and boring.", "To put it in more musical terms: If the original was an album you still play on repeat without skipping a song, this sequel is worth putting in sporadic rotation for a few killer tracks.", "Whilst it's fun in the high notes and high jinks, Pitch Perfect 2 has too many low notes to compete with the original. Aca-average.", "Pitch Perfect 2 is a witty, fun celebration of women who empower both themselves and other women.", "In the end Pitch Perfect 2 isn't creative or different but I can't deny that it made me laugh and I loved the music.", "Banks smartly sticks with what works: sarcastic humour, more than a dash of slapstick and big songs.", "It is down to the fact that these are such likable and fun characters that makes the film thoroughly enjoyable.", "Pitch Perfect 2 is a great sequel that doesn't necessarily mix the formula, but still entertains. [Full Review in Spanish]", "There was so much potential for awesome, and yet, it just fell flat.", "The musical numbers zip, and the one-liners come fast and furious, but [director Elizabeth] Banks reels it all in to a satisfying concoction that fans of the original will surely enjoy.", "For a film that screams look beyond the surface, PITCH PERFECT 2 largely perpetuates stereotypes.", "The main reason to see the sequel is the same reason you saw and loved the first movie: the songs. The music is inventive, inspiring and just really, really fun.", "I am happy to report that Pitch Perfect 2 is one of those rare sequels that satisfies fans.", "\"Pitch Perfect 2\" is a predictable repeat of the original with updated music, dance, and competition."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "2/5", "3.5/4", "B-", "B", "5/10", "", "B", "3/5", "A", "B", "3/5", "", "", "", "B", "C", "7/10", "8.5/10", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Wesley Lovell", "Leigh Paatsch", "Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "Brent McKnight", "Andrew Galdi", "Avaryl Halley", "Ryan Syrek", "Bertie Archer", "Beth McDonough", "Rachel Wagner", "James Luxford", "Paula Fleri-Soler", "David Ocadiz", "Amanda Greever", "Micheal Compton", "James Clay", "Debbie Baldwin", "Deirdre Crimmins", "Pamela Powell"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Sight", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Reader (Omaha, NE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Babbling Blonde", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times of Malta", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinerg\u00e9tica", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Daily Times (Tennessee)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fresh Fiction", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Ladue News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinematic Essential", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Journal (Kankakee, IL)"], "date": ["December 16, 2020", "November 17, 2020", "September 20, 2020", "July 15, 2020", "July 5, 2020", "April 28, 2020", "April 28, 2020", "July 30, 2019", "May 10, 2019", "May 9, 2019", "April 27, 2019", "April 5, 2019", "February 22, 2019", "February 15, 2019", "February 5, 2019", "January 23, 2019", "December 11, 2018", "December 11, 2018", "August 30, 2018", "August 21, 2018"]}}
