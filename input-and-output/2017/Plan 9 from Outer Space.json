{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Residents of California's San Fernando Valley are under attack by flying saucers from outer space. The aliens, led by Eros (Dudley Manlove) and his assistant, Tanna (Joanna Lee), intend to conquer the planet by resurrecting corpses in a Hollywood cemetery. The living dead -- a cape-wearing ghoul (Bela Lugosi), a vampire (Vampira) and a slow-footed cop (Tor Johnson) who was killed for his nosiness -- stalk curious humans who wander into the cemetery looking for evidence of the UFOs.", "rating": "67", "genre": "Cult Movies/Horror/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 19m", "director": "Edward D.

Hoberman of the Village Voice has made a case for Wood as an unconscious avant-gardist; there's no denying that his blunders are unusually creative and oddly expressive.", "Hardly The Remains of the Day, but some would claim it's more fun.", "", "It all ends with famous psychic Criswell asking the audience, 'Can you prove it didn't happen?
