{"metadata": {"synopsis": "An ordinary evening in a small Texas town becomes a grisly nightmare when a horde of flesh-eating zombies goes on the prowl. Cherry (Rose McGowan), a go-go dancer, and Wray (Freddy Rodriguez), her ex-lover, band together with other survivors in a no-holds barred effort to escape the carnage. The odds become a bit more even when Cherry, who lost her leg to a hungry ghoul, gets a machine-gun appendage and lets the bullets fly.", "rating": "75", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Horror", "runtime": "1h 26m", "director": "Robert Rodriguez", "studio": "TroublemakerStudios,ABandApart", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 18, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Rodriguez just wants viewers to have a good time, and it comes across in the film -- which is an extremely affectionate homage to seventies exploitation films.", "A dull-witted homage to 1970s schlock Grindhouse horror films.", "Packed with hot women, a ninja-like character and zombies, it's the kind of movie a 15-year-old would make with a limitless budget and little concern for ratings. Good thing he knows how to make an incredibly fun movie.", "A first-rate homage to the schlocky, sleazy B-movies of decades past.", "Planet Terror makes bad movies look good, and that's absolutely a compliment.", "Deduces that the nudging awareness and recreation of a genre's tropes is enough", "Some people call this a guilty pleasure %u2013 a silly expression that has been adopted by serious minded critics who apologise for liking overtly commercial movies", "Too ugly conceptually to be any fun.", "Geysers of blood, insinuating camera angles and an extremely playful editing style add to the mayhem, keeping us gasping in horror and laughing at the gleeful excesses on screen.", "Exciting, sexy, gory - in a good way - and frequently laugh-out-loud funny, Rodriguez's zombie exploitation flick is the most fun you'll have in the cinema all year.", "Won't make any friends outside of B-movie aficionados, and even they might tire of laughing at all the cheapo gore being thrown around.", "Dire and dunderheaded.", "McGowan is a suitably slinky presence as the lead avenger with a machine gun for a leg; blood and pus regularly fill the screen as Rodriguez lets rip with gleeful abandon.", "Only watch if you have an offbeat sense of humour.", "A loving testament to exploitation horror cinema and a moronic sop to a certain generation of male film fans' obsession with breasts, guns and gore.", "Insanely violent, ludicrously gory and probably as much fun as you'll have in a cinema this year.", "Following Tarantino's Death Proof, Rodriguez throws his hat into the Grindhouse ring and comes out the clear winner. Impossible not to be charmed by its gross-out effects, bad dialogue and amputee action.", "Gloopy and outrageous, this schlock horror tribute is pure trash... in the best possible sense.", "A bona fide trash pastiche. So good it's bad, then? Almost, but the panache and playfulness machine-gun most of the shortcomings. DVD suppliers! Can we have the two films plus trailers in one now, please?", "Aficionados will appreciate the po-faced wordplay and self-consciously gnarled-up aesthetic (missing reels, bad syncing, etc) as much as the fleshy centrepieces and gross-out grace notes.
