{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Andie (Molly Ringwald) is an outcast at her Chicago high school, hanging out either with her older boss (Annie Potts), who owns the record store where she works, or her quirky classmate Duckie (Jon Cryer), who has a crush on her. When one of the rich and popular kids at school, Blane (Andrew McCarthy), asks Andie out, it seems too good to be true. As Andie starts falling for Blane, she begins to realizes that dating someone from a different social sphere is not easy.", "rating": "75", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "Howard Deutch", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "Feb 1, 1986", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$521.0K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The fond memories of Pretty in Pink were genuinely earned.", "Sports such a bland narrative it seems the equivalent of unseasoned potatoes. Yes, Ringwald is watchable and her sequences with Harry Dean Stanton do move towards the requisite poignancy we expect.", "There are certainly funny moments and one completely out-of-place Ferris Bueller-esque breakage of the fourth wall, but otherwise Pretty in Pink is quite serious about its business.", "Hughes' utterly formulaic screenplay is largely saved by the bright '80s aesthetics as well as most of the cast. The litmus test is Cryer as Duckie -- you either find his antics amusing and adorable or maddening and moronic. (I fall into the latter camp.)", "Ringwald has an inner strength about her that makes Andie so resilient even when she is crying her eyes out.", "Neither author Hughes nor director Howard Deutch can stop the needle getting stuck in a too-familiar groove.", "Pretty in Pink lacks the originality of Sixteen Candles and The Breakfast Club, but Hughes infuses just enough unique elements like... Ringwald's signature pout to churn out one of the best teen movies ever made.", "... in the end \"Pretty in Pink\" is as fraudulent as the junk it's supposed to transcend.", "Dated high school tale is still fun for teens.", "As irresistibly sweet as cotton candy.", "First-Timer Howard Deutch is a nice surprise too. His precise, unexploitative direction is sympathetic to the awkward pauses in teen talk, to the mopery of first love, to the suicidal bravado of words spoken in heat.", "These kids have a bumpy ride, but this is one film that identifies with their passions instead of indulging them, giving us a perfect back-seat view of kids out cruising, not for kicks but for a hard-earned sense of pride.", "It's way too hackneyed for John Hughes. He's already shown us that he knows better.", "When Molly Ringwald and Annie Potts are onscreen together, the movie is aglow. See Pretty In Pink or, years from now, you may suffer side effects from missing it.", "Its deceptively soft title is a mask for a fairly powerful and pointed commentary on social standards, class differences and facades.", "Deutch has no discernible style; the scenes march ahead with only one development per scene, much like the worst in American television.", "Pretty in Pink is an engaging movie about youthful concerns that never go out of fashion.", "Unfortunately she gets straitjacketed in her current movie by a script that settles for black-and-white pronouncements instead of the delicate shades of gray that Ringwald employs.", "It belts along pleasingly enough, but this frenetic, hard-edged comedy drama is too hackneyed to be entirely successful.", "Hughes' penetrating insight into the minds of 1980s kids makes this one of the best films to bear his name."], "rating": ["6/10", "2.5/5", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "", "3/5", "3/4", "", "", "2/4", "", "", "1.5/4", "", "", "3/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Sean Collier", "Nicholas Bell", "James Kendrick", "Matt Brunson", "Allison Rose", "Nigel Andrews", "Jennifer Lind-Westbrook", "Paul Attanasio", "Marjorie Kase", "Kathleen Carroll", "Richard Corliss", "Patrick Goldstein", "Rick Lyman", "Jay Boyar", "Joe Baltake", "Gene Siskel", "Candice Russell", "", "Sue Heal", "Jon Fortgang"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Box Office Prophets", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Q Network Film Desk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Frenzy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">FlickDirect", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Financial Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Culturess", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4"], "date": ["February 8, 2021", "July 30, 2020", "July 28, 2020", "June 21, 2020", "June 16, 2020", "May 13, 2020", "July 4, 2019", "January 4, 2018", "May 31, 2016", "February 27, 2016", "June 9, 2014", "June 9, 2014", "June 9, 2014", "June 9, 2014", "June 9, 2014", "June 9, 2014", "June 9, 2014", "June 9, 2014", "June 9, 2014", "June 9, 2014"]}}
