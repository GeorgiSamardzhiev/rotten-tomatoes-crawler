{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In a society ravaged by centuries of war between humans and vampires, a legendary warrior priest (Paul Bettany), a veteran of the last conflict, lives in an enclosed city ruled by the church. When a murderous pack of vampires kidnaps his niece (Lily Collins), the priest breaks his sacred vows and sets out to rescue her before the bloodsuckers put the bite on her. Joining him on his quest are his niece's boyfriend (Cam Gigandet) and a former priestess (Maggie Q) with supernatural fighting skills.", "rating": "15", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Horror/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Western", "runtime": "1h 27m", "director": "Scott Stewart", "studio": "MichaelDeLuca,StarsRoadEntertainment", "theater_date": "May 13, 2011", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$29.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The film looks good and the action sequences have zip, but the characters are underdeveloped and the dialogue is dire.", "Paul Bettany is an intriguing choice as Priest, but his performance is so devoid of life that it might as well have been Brandon Routh.", "The movie Priest was a surprisingly racist, semi-coherent piece of mindless Hollywood idiocy, complete with genocidal fantasies, derivative Blade-Runner-future stylings, and please-please-please-grant-us-a-sequel tripe ending.", "There isn't anything here that is nurtured enough to resonate either emotionally or mythologically once the film is over.", "It's everything you've enjoyed in every genre film you've ever seen rolled into one package, although it seems to lose something when added into the sum of its parts.", "It's just a shame this world is populated with such one-dimensional, humourless characters.", "Even with hives of cool-looking vampires, cowboys on motorcycles, and ninja priests, there are some stories that are just too dumb to live.", "Another broad yet eclectic little genre-blender to (maybe) toss into your rental queue.", "Priest is one of those films you will forget about approximately five minutes after it's over. There is absolutely nothing memorable here.", "The good news is that Priest is not nearly as painful to sit through as Legion. But that's about it for the good news.", "'Priest' is about five beads shy of a rosary.", "Priest is a lousy action movie with boring characters, a convoluted plot, and, most unforgivable, very little compelling action.", "\"Priest\" is one of those films you will forget about approximately five minutes after it's over. There is absolutely nothing memorable or noteworthy about it", "anyone who has seen the trailer has seen a good 80% of anything worth watching here", "90 minutes of inconsequential action and clich recycling...painful to watch a semi-interesting setup get squandered and become stuffed into a familiar-as-hell framework where nothing ever seems at stake.", "An ugly exercise in genre filmmaking and religion bashing, Priest marks a new low in the action/horror hybrid, and once again proves why Paul Bettany is the worst action star working today.", "Bettany is a great actor who does melancholy very well, he also has a sense of mischief. It would be nice to see it shine a bit before it, too, fades to grey.", "Its visual style veers between bleached desert tones and slimy undercover dankness, but the 3D version is undistinguished.", "Some scenes on the train have a certain chill, but overall this is likely to short-change genre lovers.", "At the very least, the film's herky-jerky mood swings will keep viewers on their toes long after they become bored with the main plot."], "rating": ["", "2.5/4", "", "B-", "7/10", "2/5", "", "", "3/10", "1/5", "1.5/4", "1/5", "1.5/4", "2.5/5", "1/4", "1.5/5", "2/5", "2/5", "1.5/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Jason Best", "Richard Propes", "Noah Berlatsky", "Abbie Bernstein", "Johnny Gayzmonic", "Anna Smith", "Annalee Newitz", "Scott Weinberg", "Jeff Beck", "Steve Newton", "Roger Moore", "Ben Kendrick", "Jeff Beck", "James White", "Eric Melin", "Matthew Pejkovic", "Sandra Hall", "Philippa Hawker", "David Stratton", "Leigh Paatsch"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Talk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Splice Today", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Assignment X", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fanboys of the Universe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">io9.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheHorrorShow", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">We Got This Covered", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Georgia Straight", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tribune News Service", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen Rant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Examiner.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">SFX Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Scene-Stealers.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Matt&#39;s Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sydney Morning Herald", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Age (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">At the Movies (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)"], "date": ["December 5, 2020", "September 20, 2020", "September 16, 2019", "February 15, 2019", "November 4, 2018", "August 24, 2018", "May 26, 2018", "August 26, 2015", "March 13, 2013", "February 15, 2013", "January 12, 2013", "October 2, 2012", "September 20, 2012", "September 16, 2011", "September 9, 2011", "August 31, 2011", "August 25, 2011", "August 25, 2011", "August 25, 2011", "August 25, 2011"]}}
