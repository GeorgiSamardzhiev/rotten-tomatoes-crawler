The hunt for those who blackmailed his lover leads him to ruthless businessman Dominic Greene (Mathieu Amalric), a key player in the organization which coerced Vesper.

But it may disappoint those hoping for Marc Forster's distinctive imprint and a return to Casino Royale's top form.", "Bond is being further shaped into the character we've always known, and will most definitely be back to fight another day.", "Unfairly maligned in relation to its more colourful and emotive cousins of the Daniel Craig era, Quantum of Solace is actually the more cerebral and challenging piece of work.", "A plot of an unnecessarily complex development that fails miserably in something that its predecessor did very well: offer characters that seduce us. [Full Review in Spanish]", "This isn't a mindless blow-'em-up thriller, this is an intelligently crafted, superbly edited, lean, mean piece of work.", "While it's understandable that long-term Bond devotees may be left pining for the days when the puns were a bit more plentiful, and the punches a bit less lethal, I for one hope they don't go too far back in the other direction.", "The angsty, truant Bond and his sulky ways get too irritating, the pout notwithstanding.", "Perhaps confusing the audience is what Forster meant when he said he was making an art house picture.", "At the end of Solace there are a couple of unhappy but typical realizations: 1) that the film only runs 106 minutes when it seemed more like 166, and 2) that it's still hard to say whether Daniel Craig moves well as an action hero.", "Somehow Marc Forster's direction sucks all the vitality out of the film. There's no thrill in the chase. With the exception of an absolutely first-rate fight sequence on scaffolding in a church under renovation, Bond is having no fun at all.", "Kurylenko is certainly gorgeous, but can't match Craig as a thespian, and the necessary chemistry between them is merely mundane.", "If they want to keep making movies like this with Daniel Craig as a British secret agent, I think they should at least change his name to something besides Bond.", "It surpasses its predecessor in almost every way and delivers the best Bond film in over a decade.", "Go see Quantum of Solace. Not that you weren't going to anyway.", "It may lack the grandeur and substance of Casino Royale, but Quantum of Solace is nevertheless a unique and thrilling Bond film.", "It's a heavy-hearted film for a weary time.
