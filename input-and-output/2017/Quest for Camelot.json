{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this animated tale, Kayley (Jessalyn Gilsig) dreams of being one of the Knights of the Round Table; she gets her chance when the fabled sword of Excalibur is lost. Without its power to protect him, King Arthur falls victim to Ruber (Gary Oldman), an evil knight bent on destroying Camelot. Arthur's only hope is that Kayley will find the sword. She gets some invaluable assistance from Merlin's trusty falcon, a dragon with a split personality, and a sweet blindman named Garrett (Cary Elwes).", "rating": "45", "genre": "Animation/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 25m", "director": "Frederik Du Chau", "studio": "WarnerBros.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 1, 2008", "box_office": "$22.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Both the derring-do of this duo and the comic antics of their animal sidekicks (particularly a talkative two-headed dragon) will keep children entertained.", "Adapted from the novel The King's Damosel by British writer Vera Chapman, it's hot on character but rather devoid of action.", "Energetic, pacey and funny with tons of great fights.
