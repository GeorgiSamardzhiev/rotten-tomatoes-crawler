{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 2028, OmniCorp is at the center of robot technology. While its drones have long been used by the military overseas, their use is forbidden in American law enforcement. However, OmniCorp gets a golden opportunity to crack that market when Detroit cop Alex Murphy (Joel Kinnaman) is critically injured in the line of duty. By transforming Murphy into a cyborg, OmniCorp executives hope to rake in billions for their shareholders, but they forget one thing: There's still a man inside the machine.", "rating": "48", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 57m", "director": "Jos\u00e9 Padilha", "studio": "StrikeEntertainment", "theater_date": "Feb 12, 2014", "dvd_date": "Aug 12, 2016", "box_office": "$58.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It simply doesn't have the vulgar verve that Verhoeven brought to the original, but between the explosions and bullets it does tackle some big, timely questions about drone warfare and corporate responsibility.", "Remaking a nearly flawless movie is a feat few filmmakers, if any, have ever accomplished.", "Ends up being a far too timid remake.", "The comparisons are inevitable but the remake is no masterpiece.", "This new version of RoboCop is an entirely different animal, and that's just fine. Gone is the biting social satire...The social conscience is still there, but it's more subtle and more along the lines of commentary than all out satire.", "RoboCop wants to be about big ideas like identity, the nature of self, man vss technology, security versus freedom, corporate greed that puts profits over people, and all manner of lofty themes. Only the film never actually explores any of them.", "Unfortunately, like a lot of the ideas, they never really capitalized on it and the idea was ultimately just forced into a simple plot device to move things along.", "Maybe every generation gets the RoboCop it deserves. I'm just not sure what we did to deserve this one.", "A sleek, mechanical film missing the brain, the heart and, most of all, the balls that powered the first one.", "Well-paced, cleverly drawn out though lacking in places, RoboCop will please those who aren't into the heavy stuff.", "Aside from the decision to relegate the insightful and challenging drone content to Jackson's sporadic monologues, the worst decision was to ixnay the satirical comedy of the original film.", "A reboot with a real kick.", "RoboCop is a respectful remake. Nevertheless, it fails to captivate the violence and social satyre of Paul Verhoeven's cult classic. [Full review in Spanish]", "The problem is the film never seems like it has a point or purpose... Kinnaman doesn't help either. He's a rather bland lead whose performance is robotic even before he dons the armored suit.", "RoboCop is a decent action science-fiction film that does make us think and feel, but not as much as it could have given its parameters and heritage.", "I can't really figure it out. From what I saw on the screen, nobody else could either.", "For Padilha's run-of-the-mill RoboCop, the metal-head crime-stopper is barely worth his arresting appeal.", "RoboCop's beating heart has been subsumed by the single-minded programming of MGM's franchise-building machinery.", "Is this new RoboCop trying to be the original? No, it's not. It takes the core concept of the original and does its own thing with it.", "RoboCop is both inventive and original enough to stand on its own animatronic feet, and I was in shock how much I enjoyed this reinvention."], "rating": ["3/5", "4/10", "2.0/4", "2.5/5", "", "C-", "", "", "1.2/5", "3/5", "C-", "4/5", "6.8/10", "C", "B", "", "2/4", "C+", "7.5/10", "8/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Damond Fudge", "Brent McKnight", "VyceVictus", "Chris McCoy", "David Harris", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Ryan Syrek", "Christopher Preston", "Nicol\u00e1s Ruiz", "Micheal Compton", "Abbie Bernstein", "Amanda Greever", "Frank Ochieng", "Zaki Hasan", "Jennifer Heaton", "Aaron Peterson"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Confessions From A Geek Mind", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KCCI (Des Moines, IA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Birth.Movies.Death.", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flick Feast", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Reader (Omaha, NE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">C\u00f3digo espagueti", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Assignment X", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Daily Times (Tennessee)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">SF Crowsnest", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Zaki&#39;s Corner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternative Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Hollywood Outsider"], "date": ["February 1, 2021", "December 4, 2020", "September 21, 2020", "July 16, 2020", "July 14, 2020", "July 8, 2020", "February 7, 2020", "January 8, 2020", "November 21, 2019", "November 20, 2019", "August 6, 2019", "June 8, 2019", "March 21, 2019", "February 1, 2019", "January 17, 2019", "January 9, 2019", "November 11, 2018", "November 4, 2018", "November 1, 2018", "October 12, 2018"]}}
