{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Small-town beauty queen and devout Baptist Marla Mabrey (Lily Collins), under contract to the infamous Howard Hughes (Warren Beatty), arrives in Los Angeles. At the airport, she meets her driver, Frank Forbes, only two weeks on the job and also from a religiously conservative background. Their instant attraction not only puts their religious convictions to the test but also defies Hughes' number one rule: no employee is allowed to have an intimate relationship with a contract actress.", "rating": "55", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 1m", "director": "Warren Beatty", "studio": "RatpacEntertainment,RegencyEnterprises,WorldviewEntertainment,Shangri-LaEntertainment,DemarestFilms", "theater_date": "Nov 23, 2016", "dvd_date": "Feb 14, 2017", "box_office": "$3.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A handsome movie that lives up to its name. The strict rules of romantic comedy, drama and biography don't apply here. It's a wistful confection, sometimes frothy, sometimes idiosyncratic, that feels like it might have sprung from the era it portrays.", "The film may be less \"masterful\" than Oscar-hungry pundits might expect from someone as legendary as Beatty, but it's better than masterful - it's personal.", "The film is poorly made, choppy and rambling.", "Rules Don't Apply has bigger problems than underusing its acting talent. The truth is, it's not about anything.", "Mixing notes of nostalgia with a parody of not just Hughes' outlandish behavior but the cultural mores of the period, it's a welcome return to the screen for Beatty both in front of and behind the camera.", "The real problem is the script, because it gives the impression that it never decides what story it really wants to be. [Full Review in Spanish]", "This film experiences large amounts of drag. A who's who of Hollywood in supporting roles...and fine, vintage production design, however, avoid it being a total plane wreck.", "It's nice that Warren Beatty was able to bring his passion project to the big screen. I only wish that it had been something better.", "Though Rules Don't Apply is undeniably Beatty's show, the true breakout is lead Alden Ehrenreich.", "Rules Don't Apply is a movie that's uneven in its construction but is able to coast by due to three solid performances from its cast.", "All in all, Rules Don't Apply is ... uneven. The film suffers from trying to do too much. Had it been either a romance ... character study, the movie could have been stellar.", "Has all the potential to be an exceptional romantic drama especially from the performances by the leads if it wasn't hampered with frantic pacing and incredibly choppy editing.", "In a season filled with heart-wrenching, disturbing, and depressing films (many of them excellent, mind you), Rules Don't Apply is a fun and welcome escape.", "No one could rein in Hughes, and no one reigns in \"Rules Don't Apply.\" It's an intriguing but saggy excursion through Old Hollywood via the eyes of an underdeveloped character.", "The kids are all right, but with a hammier-than-thou Beatty around no-one else gets much of a look-in.", "[Rules Don't Apply] is an entertaining and surprisingly low-key portrait of excess.", "Warren Beatty's comeback movie is a sometimes bizarre, sometimes winning film about multi-hyphenate billionaire Howard Hughes (Beatty) in 1959 and 1964...", "Ehrenreich and Collins are both charming but framkly they're amuse-bouches for Beatty's bone-in prime rib.", "Warren Beatty orchestrates an odd declaration of love of cinema.
