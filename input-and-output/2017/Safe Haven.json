{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Katie Feldman (Julianne Hough) moves to a small town on the North Carolina coast, determined to make a new life for herself. She takes a job as a waitress and keeps a low profile, but she is soon won over by the warmth and caring of the close-knit community, especially that of widower Alex (Josh Duhamel). With the help of Alex and his children, Katie learns to love and trust again -- but when a mysterious stranger arrives and starts asking questions, Katie's dark past threatens to reclaim her.", "rating": "13", "genre": "Drama/Special Interest/Romance", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Lasse Hallstr\u00f6m", "studio": "NicholasSparksProductions,TempleHill", "theater_date": "Feb 14, 2013", "dvd_date": "May 6, 2013", "box_office": "$71.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The film has action sequences, though they are horridly done and severely disrupt the tone of a film with an already disrupted tone.", "Dull, sappy, and manipulative to the point of being offensive.", "A \"safe\" bet for a wonderful moviegoing experience, especially this Valentine's weekend, take a chance and wrap yourself in the mystery and romance of Safe Haven.", "The sentimental plot twist is particularly arch. It's essentially a means to endow further dignity on an already idealised thirtysomething father and his impossibly cute kids.", "Despite Hough and Duhamel's best efforts to inject some chemistry into proceedings, their relationship is gratingly insipid stuff.", "The right balance of love, drama and adversity, Safe Haven mixes in a little mystery to keep the narrative interesting - though audiences could probably have done without the supernatural element.", "How long can writer Nicholas Sparks trade off his iconic blub-fest The Notebook?", "If you're a fan of Sparks, and like-minded feel-good romantic dramas, Safe Haven will deliver what you know and love; everyone else should be well warned by now.", "A movie whose punch line is so delightfully absurd that even after you pretty much know what's coming you spit out your Pepsi anyway.", "All the usual romance and idyllic locations-and-vengeful-violent-ex-husband, up until the weirdest, most out-of-nowhere plot twist ever.", "few will leave the cinema feeling they've seen something original or affecting", "While a predictable chick flick, Safe Haven is never dull. It's not particularly good, either.", "...the feel-good finale is unable to pack the emotional punch that Hallstrom is obviously striving for...", "A wholly inert lump of by-the-numbers syrup that's as boring as it is pointless.", "This latest Sparks adaptation should please audiences seeking wish-fulfillment romantic fantasy; the new love depicted here is so pure and true it even receives supernatural endorsement.", "Sparks' field may be fertile, but it's also rich in manure.", "Expect to gag early and often, and consider breaking up with anyone who forces you to sit through this.", "A bland love story that features a twist that feels more like a dupe.", "It's typical comfort food filmmaking and that's exactly what Safe Haven is: a mouthful of cotton candy. Empty, overly sweet, and likely to kill you from diabetes.", "I don't know when has the sexy south has ever looked dry."], "rating": ["1.5/4", "D", "", "2/5", "1/5", "", "2/5", "3/5", "", "2/5", "2/5", "2/5", "1.5/4", "", "2/4", "C", "1/4", "C-", "4/10", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "PJ Nabarro", "Ben Nicholson", "Sarah Gopaul", "Larushka Ivan-Zadeh", "Francesca Rudkin", "Wesley Morris", "Stephen Silver", "James Luxford", "Travis Hopson", "David Nusair", "Eric D.
