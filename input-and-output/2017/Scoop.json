{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Even in death, British reporter Joe Strombel (Ian McShane) is dedicated to completing his final piece on London's notorious Tarot Card Killer, and American journalism student Sondra Pransky (Scarlett Johansson) discovers during a magician's (Woody Allen) performance that she can communicate with Joe.

Of course, Match Point wasn't trying to be funny either.
