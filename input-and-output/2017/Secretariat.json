She was right. This weekend, fill your heart with Secretariat.", "The story has an unbeatable momentum, harnessing an entire team of underdog heroes...", "Lane is solid in the lead, while Malkovich, Margo Martindale and James Cromwell have their moments in supporting roles.", "If you want to see a movie about a woman who loves her horse, or who is literally (as opposed to figuratively) risking everything for either a conviction or for any kind of altruistic goal, this isn't it.", "It's hopeful, it's cheerful, it's funny, and there's nothing in it to keep you from seeing it with either your 88-year-old grandmother or your 8-year-old daughter. Even better, both are likely to enjoy it.", "If you want to see a horseracing movie with your family about the triumph of spirit through sport and the unique bond between a horse and its rider, just stay home and rent The Black Stallion.", "The race scenes are impressively kinetic as Wallace uses slow-motion shots, low camera angles and archived footage to imbue the races with excitement, but it's not enough to lift this Hallmark snooze-fest.", "a safe, enjoyable movie that can be watched by yourself, on a date or at your mother's house after Sunday dinner", "It teeters between pleasantly generic film biography and rank manipulation.", "You could go see this just to enjoy the production design.", "Diane Lane delivers one of the finest performances of her career.", "Secretariat is cliched, unrealistic and predictable, but it will make you feel good", "This horse-sports-opera boasts all the ingredients for a successful run.", "Celebrates greatness on four legs with a decent--if not record-breaking--amount of light entertainment.
