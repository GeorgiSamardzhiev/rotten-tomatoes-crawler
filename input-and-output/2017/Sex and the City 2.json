For anyone else, \"Sex and the City 2\" really doesn't bring much to the table.", "The sequel, Sex and the City 2, wipes any urges towards mirth.

[Full review in Spanish]", "Though the sequel doesn't pack as much juice as the original movie, Sex And The City 2 doesn't leave your martini glass empty.", "I did actually try to watch it and gave up midway through in nauseated horror.", "The most important thing to realize is that the film is poorly written and constructed and is just too long (at almost 2 1/2 hours).", "Sex and the City 2 makes Phyllis Schlafly look like Andrea Dworkin.", "This is the kind of movie that its participants refer to in small, dismissive groans at reunion parties.", "A cliched mess, this comedy lacks the carefree humor of its superior predecessor."], "rating": ["4/10", "1.5/4", "3/4", "1.5/5", "", "", "2.5/4", "C-", "1/5", "", "1/5", "", "", "", "B", "", "", "", "0.5/4", "1.0/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Sarah Knight Adamson", "Nikki Baughan", "Leslie Combemale", "Brian D.
