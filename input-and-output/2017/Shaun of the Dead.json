{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Shaun (Simon Pegg) is a 30-something loser with a dull, easy existence. When he's not working at the electronics store, he lives with his slovenly best friend, Ed (Nick Frost), in a small flat on the outskirts of London. The only unpredictable element in his life is his girlfriend, Liz (Kate Ashfield), who wishes desperately for Shaun to grow up and be a man. When the town is inexplicably overrun with zombies, Shaun must rise to the occasion and protect both Liz and his mother (Penelope Wilton).", "rating": "92", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Horror/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Edgar Wright", "studio": "WT\u00b2,BigTalk", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 23, 2013", "box_office": "$13.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The best zombie comedy yet made.", "This is a very funny movie, if you can stand the gore and the thought of your best friend being kept a zombie to play video games with.", "It's up there among the best horror comedies of all time.
