{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Looking for a way out of their mundane government jobs, Austin Millbarge (Dan Aykroyd) and Emmett Fitz-Hume (Chevy Chase) take the entrance exam for a CIA espionage program. Immediately chosen to take part in a top-secret mission in the Middle East by the officious Gen. Sline (Steve Forrest), the new recruits are set upon by Soviet forces in Afghanistan. Soon it becomes clear that the hapless pair are being used as decoys to expose the Russians for a Cold War nuclear showdown.", "rating": "32", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "John Landis", "studio": "WarnerBros.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 15, 2008", "box_office": "$56.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Dated '80s comedy has strong language, few laughs.", "That Chase is godawful is no surprise -- he's been running on empty for years with variations on that tired \"I'm Chevy Chase and you're not\" riff.", "Landis' direction is indulgent, to say the least, with big landscapes, big crashes, big hardware, and big gags filling the screen. What he forgets is character development, that all-important factor that must exist for comedy to work well.", "The movie has since become a cult classic; one that those of a certain age and gender have committed to near memory and can spout lines and scenes on command like a new Army recruit.", "nothing more than a nostalgia trip for people my age who remember seeing it in theatres and, because we were twelve, thinking it was hilarious.", "...may never reach comic heights but, nonetheless, maintains a good-natured charm.", "Landis never bothers to account for the friendship that springs up spontaneously between these two antipathetic types, but then he never bothers to account for anything in this loose progression of recycled Abbott and Costello riffs.", "The script is so patchy that most of the genuine laughs are squeezed into the first half; the rest is a rather tacky and confused extended joke about the nuclear arms race.", "", "", "Often funny film boasts no less then 10 film directors on screen in small roles. Stick around for the Paul McCartney penned title song.", "Director John Landis likes to build elaborate cinematic toys, but this one is a comic clinker.", "Too bad audiences didn't.", "[An] irritating comedy in which Aykroyd and Chase play officials who are sent on a secret mission as decoys whilst the real spies do their work. Their inadequacy is matched by a jokey script of dubious morals and taste.", "There are seeds of something funny in the film's beginning and in its premise, but they are soon dissipated by so little sustained wit, and so much scenery.", "", "", "Once again proof that life is rough after Saturday Night Live.", "Typical lame 80s star vehicle", "Meddles uneasily between comedy and action-adventure, but Chevy Chase and Dan Ayrkoyd keep you watching right way through"], "rating": ["2/5", "", "1/4", "3/5", "1/4", "6/10", "", "", "1/5", "2/5", "3/5", "2/5", "1/5", "", "1.5/5", "3/5", "3/5", "1/5", "2/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Andrea Beach", "Paul Attanasio", "", "Jason Newman", "Walter Chaw", "John J.
