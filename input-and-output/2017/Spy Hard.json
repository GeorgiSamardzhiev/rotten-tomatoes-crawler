{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The evil Gen. Rancor (Andy Griffith) has his sights set on world domination, and only one man can stop him: Dick Steele (Leslie Nielsen), also known as Agent WD-40. Rancor needs to obtain a computer circuit for the missile that he is planning to fire, so Steele teams up with Veronique Ukrinsky (Nicollette Sheridan), a KGB agent whose father designed the chip. Together they try to locate the evil mastermind's headquarters, where Veronique's father and several other hostages are being held.", "rating": "8", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 20m", "director": "Rick Friedberg", "studio": "HollywoodPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 4, 2015", "box_office": "$27.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["[A] haphazardly executed send-up.", "The result is 80 brief minutes of movie skits assembled in an order that sort of resembles a plot.", "The movie will be of interest only to Nielsen's most devoted fans and to those who wonder why Nicollette Sheridan never made more movies, or more swimsuit calendars.", "The jokes come in sporadic volleys rather than the steady machine-gun pace of The Naked Gun and Airplane!, and, with a few exceptions, they are less truly aimed.", "The blockbuster action thriller genre is ripe for sending up, but this lazy effort has to go down as a miss despite the presence of spoofmeister Leslie Nielsen.", "Sporadically funny, but never more than a sting of crude gags.", "Yet another Leslie Nielson movie parody, targeted this time at James Bond pictures and their many spinoffs.", "As funny as Nielsen can be, like all comic actors he still needs the quick-thinking jokes and zingy one-liners to be genuinely funny.", "Spy Hard just comes off as a long commercial. And yes, that means most of the best moments you've seen in the movie's trailer.", "More of a cinematic joke book than a real movie, Spy Hard hits you with gags faster than Henny Youngman on speed. Even when individual bits misfire, the unrelenting barrage of silliness can break down your resistance.", "Spy Hard is a loose send-up of the Bond series and other overly expensive action flicks, but after Hot Shots! Part Deux and National Lampoon's Loaded Weapon 1 who needs another action parody?", "Never mind that the smutty, high-tech 007 capers already wink at the conventions of the bikini-clad, gizmo-strewn genre. If the martini is shaken, not stirred, why beat it to death with a swizzle stick?", "Nielsen's schtick is getting pretty threadbare by now -- his movies used to wring laughs from assaults on his silver-haired dignity, but after years of screen buffoonery, he has no dignity left to assault.", "The picture that will test the durability of Leslie Nielsen's lowbrow franchise, Spy Hard sticks closely to the Naked Gun formula. Not only is the formula itself wearing thin, but the gags themselves feel recycled.", "", "Like Hot Shots! there's the same mistaken belief that simply tagging other films will be intrinsically funny...", "", "", "This one's a real disappointment -- it only registered a few snickers from me at best.", ""], "rating": ["", "2/4", "2/4", "2/4", "2/5", "2/5", "2/4", "1.5/4", "2/4", "", "C-", "", "1.5/4", "", "1/5", "", "2/5", "3/5", "C-", "1/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Ralph Novak", "Stephen Hunter", "Gary Thompson", "Desmond Ryan", "John Ferguson", "Darren Bignell", "David Sterritt", "John Petrakis", "Doug Thomas", "Jay Boyar", "Owen Gleiberman", "Rita Kempley", "", "Variety Staff", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "Derek Adams", "Emanuel Levy", "Randy Shulman", "Laura Clifford", "Greg Maki"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">FulvueDrive-in.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro Weekly (Washington, DC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reeling Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Star-Democrat (Easton, MD)"], "date": ["June 14, 2013", "June 14, 2013", "June 14, 2013", "June 14, 2013", "June 4, 2013", "June 4, 2013", "June 4, 2013", "June 4, 2013", "June 4, 2013", "June 4, 2013", "September 7, 2011", "July 6, 2010", "August 12, 2009", "March 26, 2009", "May 7, 2007", "June 24, 2006", "November 6, 2005", "June 30, 2005", "April 9, 2005", "January 31, 2005"]}}
