The assault came from Krall (Idris Elba), a lizard-like dictator who derives his energy by sucking the life out of his victims. Krall needs an ancient and valuable artifact that's aboard the badly damaged starship. Left stranded in a rugged wilderness, Kirk (Chris Pine), Spock (Zachary Quinto) and the rest of the crew must now battle a deadly alien race while trying to find a way off their hostile planet.", "rating": "86", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 2m", "director": "Justin Lin", "studio": "PerfectStormEntertainment,SkydanceProductions,SneakyShark,BadRobot,K/OPaperProducts", "theater_date": "Jul 22, 2016", "dvd_date": "Oct 4, 2016", "box_office": "$158.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The tension is fleeting, especially when the majority of action sequences are so heavily augmented by CG that any genuine stunts disappear in the visual chaos.", "Star Trek Beyond also serves as a fitting and respectful end for these group of characters. Just like what Skyfall did for James Bond on their 50th anniversary, this is the real start of the adventures of the Starship Enterprise.", "It...has a very classic \"Trek\" feel...It has excitement and humor, introduces us to several new alien species and has a terrific mean and scary villain. Everything a good Star Trek story needs.", "Maybe the rebooted franchise has more left in the tank than we thought.", "The film may not go beyond what we've already seen, but as a sci-fi piece of entertainment, it knows when to use the Star Trek formula to deliver scenes that are sometimes surprising. [Full review in Spanish]", "An admirably modest, more character-driven Trek movie, Star Trek Beyond foregrounds its characters and emotions over grandstanding action sequences - most of the time, anyway.", "I found this movie to be very entertaining.", "I found it really campy and silly and fun.", "The newest entry in the franchise, Star Trek Beyond, may lack some of the stately grandeur of OG Trek, but it's got optimism in spades.", "Star Trek Beyond carries Roddenberry's conviction that we can solve our problems by sticking together and applying equal parts compassion and logic, and its optimism is catchy.", "This is an action-packed film with massive destruction, and interesting relationships, plus some good comedy and positive messages.", "Despite the action-heavy delivery, the beating heart of the series remained intact, thanks largely to the cast and their chemistry and charisma.", "As for the main plot and action, I think that it is visually one of the most interesting and impressive of the series so far.", "This is the most truly \"Star Trek\"-esque installment of the new series, albeit one that retains enough CGI \"kerpow and kaboom\" to Rodden your Berries.", "Most importantly it was a film about characters, which has always been the most important part of Star Trek.", "A welcome refresh that again grounds the series in the spirit of idealism and optimism that were at the forefront of creator Gene Roddenberry's thinking, and which have no expiration date.", "2009's eponymous uncorking of this rejuvenated series remains far more satisfying than the two glasses that have followed, but Beyond hints the best might yet be still to come.", "While the hardcore Trekkers might still take issue, they're likely to enjoy it more than the previous installment. And for those who are simply fans of sci-fi action, well they're in for a treat.", "It's the 13th film in the franchise, and it's a fantastic addition.", "\"Beyond\" doesn't quite live up to the lofty standards of the previous two films, but it still manages to be a solid bit of summer escapism that will definitely please the fan base."], "rating": ["3/10", "4/5", "", "B", "7/10", "3.5/5", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "8.5/10", "A-", "A-", "A", "3/5", "5/5", "", "B-"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Damond Fudge", "Brent McKnight", "Yasser Medina", "Shaun Munro", "Avaryl Halley", "Andrew Galdi", "Tim Brennan", "Chris McCoy", "Linda and Al Lerner", "Kate Rodger", "Karl Delossantos", "Ryan Syrek", "Rachel Wagner", "Zaki Hasan", "Christopher Preston", "Allen Adams", "Amanda Greever", "Micheal Compton"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Confessions From A Geek Mind", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KCCI (Des Moines, IA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flickering Myth", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">About Boulder", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies and Shakers", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newshub (NZ)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Smash Cut Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Reader (Omaha, NE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Zaki&#39;s Corner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Maine Edge", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Daily Times (Tennessee)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News"], "date": ["December 5, 2020", "July 17, 2020", "July 14, 2020", "July 2, 2020", "June 26, 2020", "May 31, 2020", "May 6, 2020", "May 6, 2020", "February 13, 2020", "January 14, 2020", "October 23, 2019", "August 30, 2019", "August 7, 2019", "July 9, 2019", "April 12, 2019", "April 12, 2019", "March 29, 2019", "February 16, 2019", "February 5, 2019", "January 15, 2019"]}}
