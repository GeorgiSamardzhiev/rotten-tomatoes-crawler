It may not be super good, but it is good enough.", "Hysterically funny and also strangely poignant and heartfelt.", "... \"Superbad\" isn't perfect. But it's super close.", "Yes, Superbad is a boy's story, so a certain perspective should be expected, and it's not the cheerful filth that bothers me, nor even the conventional morality; it's the paternalism.", "... the love child of American Pie and Dazed and Confused.", "Superbad is a movie about partying and getting wasted and getting the girl, but as the night wears on, much wisdom is gained too, about self, friendship and the end of teenage innocence in all its wondrous, terrifying splendor.", "Beneath the swearing and the tampon jokes lies a sweet-hearted tale of three chums celebrating the end of their carefree high-school days.", "It's a simple tale about two horny kids not only on a quest for vodka, beer and sticky fumbling, but they're looking to find themselves in the process. I'll be damned if there's many people left in the cinema afterwards who won't relate to that.", "Honest goodwill, fond observational detail and Greg Mottola's exuberant direction make the picture nigh on irresistible, but there are some missteps.", "The affable trajectory covers enough guffaws to balance out the flattest visuals this side of The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes", "Like all Apatow productions, it's far too long but it has a winning combination of cleverly crude humor and genuine sweetness.", "What makes the film so appealing is the disconnect between what comes from the mouths of these hormone-addled pups and what's going on in their heads, where they're still clinging desperately to the innocence they're leaving behind.", "With Superbad, Rogen continues to show off his writing skills, delivering one of the most viciously funny movies since Super Troopers.", "[Cera] has some of the best comic timing of anyone working in film today, a precocious sense of the awkward pauses and misread cues in which social panic resides.", "The comic-duo of Jonah Hill and Michael Cera reminded me of an immature, foul-mouthed Laurel & Hardy.", "even if Superbad's not much more than a teen comedy, it's the best teen comedy to come out in at least a decade. There's no shame in that.", "Thanks to Rogen and Apatow we can once again look forward to seeing R-rated comedies.", "a fresh air"], "rating": ["8/10", "3.0/4", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "A", "", "8/10", "", "4.5/5", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Micheal Compton", "Matthew Lucas", "Devin Gordon", "Dorothy Woodend", "Sean Axmaker", "Scott Foundas", "Chris Knight", "Ali Gray", "Ryan Gilbey", "Fernando F.
