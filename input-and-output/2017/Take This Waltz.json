When I first saw it I wasn't sure how to feel, I just knew that I did.", "Take the Waltz is wonderfully played out, with a great performance from [Michelle] Williams, bringing a refreshing change on the typical out-of-love relationship.", "Polley captures this love triangle with a sharp eye for detail.", "A frustrating, yet undeniably beguiling observation of love and infatuation told through a staunchly female perspective", "[Director Sarah] Polley, who also wrote and directed the great 2006 film Away from Her, can make magic and then show how reality inevitably intrudes on it.", "This is experiencing the acceptance of disconnection, which can manifest every time we meet someone new and/or feel displaced with someone we thought we'd love forever. Polley is an important director to fearlessly capture this here.", "Polley doesn't seem to know what to do with [Seth Rogen], domesticating the...persona that you know would have had a ribald field day with those chickens he's always cooking.", "Polley is a detail-oriented director who can get a little lost dazzling us with the little things.", "It's such a strange little movie but beautifully acted and undeniably fascinating.", "Sexually charged, frank, and relatable, Take This Waltz is a bittersweet observation of adult romance.", "[A] sunny dramedy that lulls its viewers with pseudo quirks, but which actually hides an altogether terrifying dead heart that clubs viewers over the head with its nauseating examination of an insufferable, unhappy woman.", "Take This Waltz is a Remarkable, Offbeat Love Story", "While hardly a complete failure, 'Waltz' nevertheless finds Polley dancing to the beat of a simmering romantic triangle with two left feet.", "This is finely-judged filmmaking from a writing and directing talent to watch.", "A mess of the sort that only a brilliant person can slop up on there.", "The gorgeous photography gives summertime Toronto a steamy, sexy glow and the music (including the Leonard Cohen song that provides the title) adds to the film's air of yearning.", "Though nicely shot and well acted, especially by Michelle Williams, this is a minor, conventional work and a step down for Polley after her splashy directing debut, Away from Her.", "Intriguing, but wispy and built on unlikable characters doing shallow and unpleasant things.", "This slice-of-life character study doesn't tell the whole story. Rather, this is a glimpse into a short part of the life of a woman who seems a lot like an enigma."], "rating": ["", "", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3/4", "", "", "", "4.5/5", "8/10", "", "", "C", "", "7/10", "", "C+", "2/4", "B"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jim Ross", "Kristy Strouse", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Jamie Dunn", "Patrick Gamble", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Jim Laczkowski", "Pat Padua", "Michelle Orange", "Damien Straker", "Austin Trunick", "Glenn Dunks", "Chase Whale", "Al Alexander", "Catherine Bray", "Tim Brayton", "Jason Best", "Emanuel Levy", "Roger Moore", "Robert Roten"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TAKE ONE Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">In Their Own League", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Musings of Guitargalchina", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Skinny", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Examiner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Voices &amp; Visions", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">DCist", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Capital New York", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Impulse Gamer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Under the Radar", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Trespass", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Patriot Ledger", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Talk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tribune News Service", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Laramie Movie Scope"], "date": ["February 13, 2020", "February 6, 2020", "December 9, 2019", "November 22, 2019", "February 2, 2019", "December 29, 2018", "October 31, 2018", "August 30, 2018", "September 11, 2017", "August 20, 2014", "August 17, 2014", "September 8, 2013", "August 29, 2013", "June 2, 2013", "March 4, 2013", "January 9, 2013", "January 7, 2013", "January 6, 2013", "January 6, 2013", "December 4, 2012"]}}
