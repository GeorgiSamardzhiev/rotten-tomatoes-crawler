{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Journalist Tamara Drewe (Gemma Arterton) returns to the small town she grew up in and causes a stir. Once an unattractive teenager with a big nose, she's had cosmetic surgery and transformed herself into a beautiful girl. She is the object of attention for three different men: Andy (Luke Evans) a local handyman and her former boyfriend; Ben (Dominic Cooper), a drummer in a rock band; and Nicholas (Roger Allam), the man who runs the local writers colony -- and also happens to be married.", "rating": "65", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 50m", "director": "Stephen Frears", "studio": "RubyFilms,BBCFilms", "theater_date": "Oct 8, 2010", "dvd_date": "Jul 1, 2014", "box_office": "$560.1K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Very funny, yet tragic, with fantastic performances - such a treat.", "Roger Allam breaks away from the British stage long enough to leave a lasting impression here.", "Frears offers us a film with a certain charm and a somewhat sarcastic humor that, however, greatly limits its access to the satire of British society that was the original comic. [Full Review in Spanish]", "It's fun but overlong, not a waste of regular time, but probably of festival time.", "Tamara Drewe's self-proclamations of having blended \"intelligent\" British humour with black comedy slowly fritters away as the film plods towards its abrupt and wholly unsatisfactory ending.", "It sounds like a fun romp, and it should be a fun romp, but it isn't. Instead, it's tiring and plain silly, without a single plausible character.", "A gentle satire without being mean-spirited, which is a difficult tone to maintain; and as far as comedy goes, it's actually quite good in its understated fashion.", "The project has a slapdash, good-enough-for-government work feel to it.", "A judicious comic actor, Arterton plays the eponymous Tamara, who throws a small English village into a tizzy when she returns from London to put the family cottage on the market.", "", "", "The overripe Arterton is put on glorious display, but... there's little joy and not much romp in this cluttered sex farce.", "Frears' loose-limbed film, while warm and fitfully witty, feels consistently and steadfastly like less than the sum of its parts.", "It's only as the narrative adopts an increasingly episodic feel that one's interest begins to wane...", "It's a fine diversion filled with silly people following their silly desires.", "Frears' screen version slightly coarsens Simmonds' wit and softens her sharpness, but even if his film manages to be more cartoony than the original cartoons, it remains hugely enjoyable.", "It doesn't hold together that well, but there are enough moments of wry inspiration to keep the movie more or less afloat.", "full review at Movies for the Masses", "Starts with great wit and then dissipates into a hazy episodic mess", "[Stephen] Frears brings a light touch and a knowing compassion to this pastoral romantic farce..."], "rating": ["", "3.0/4", "", "", "2/5", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "4/5", "2/4", "", "2/4", "B", "", "2/4", "3/5", "2.5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Charlotte Harrison", "Richard Propes", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Tara Thorne", "Daniel Green", "Deborah Ross", "Sarah Manvel", "Sean Burns", "Amy Taubin", "", "", "Roger Moore", "Brent Simon", "David Nusair", "Eric D.
