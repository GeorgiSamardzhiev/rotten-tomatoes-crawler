{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Popular cartoon characters Rocky and Bullwinkle make their big-screen debut in this adventure tale that combines animation with live action. Years after their television show was canceled, Rocky and Bullwinkle are still living off the residuals.

But they seem as dull as dishwater, and completely out of place, in a live action world. Hence, their Adventures never connect with viewers.", "Rocky and Bullwinkle's CGI effects recall its antecedent Who Framed Roger Rabbit, and like that film its dialogue is packed with cultural references that will have adults laughing harder than the kids.", "While the movie continually teeters on the brink of abject corniness, it never quite topples off. And it doesn't hurt to have Robert De Niro, Rene Russo and Jason Alexander camping it up as cartoon villains come to life.", "", "Kids will enjoy it, even if the jokes escape them.", "All things considered, I got more fun out of the much maligned earlier attempt of bringing characters from the show to film, Boris and Natasha.", "Expected punny dialogue and sight gags ensue, but also packed in are pointed, self-deprecating barbs about Hollywood, moviemaking, and the conventions of cartoons themselves.", "These complaints are mere trifles compared to the fun I had at seeing my favorite moose and squirrel again.", "", "If you liked the 1960s cartoon series upon which this film is based, you'll like this film.", "", "", "There's just not enough depth of thought to sustain it onscreen for 90 minutes.", "", "", "All of this adds up to a story we don't care about with nothing particularly involving and about two laughs both in the first ten minutes.", "For the most part, the film succeeds, with predictable complaints stemming from the stretch marks that plague all features based on TV/animated shows.", "The nostalgic glow wears off pretty quickly ... and the movie has nothing to fall back on except bad puns and a brace of awkward cameo turns.", ""], "rating": ["2/4", "", "3/5", "", "C-", "3/5", "3/5", "3/4", "3/4", "1/5", "3/5", "4/10", "2/4", "1/5", "2.5/4", "3.5/5", "1/5", "2/4", "", "0/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Nusair", "Kathi Maio", "Kaleem Aftab", "David Germain", "Owen Gleiberman", "Nell Minow", "Ken Hanke", "Michael Dequina", "Jeffrey M.
