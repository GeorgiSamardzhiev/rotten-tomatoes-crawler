{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A new baby's arrival impacts a family, told from the point of view of a delightfully unreliable narrator -- a wildly imaginative 7-year-old named Tim. The most unusual Boss Baby (Alec Baldwin) arrives at Tim's home in a taxi, wearing a suit and carrying a briefcase. The instant sibling rivalry must soon be put aside when Tim discovers that Boss Baby is actually a spy on a secret mission, and only he can help thwart a dastardly plot that involves an epic battle between puppies and babies.", "rating": "53", "genre": "Animation/Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Tom McGrath", "studio": "DreamWorksAnimation", "theater_date": "Mar 31, 2017", "dvd_date": "Jul 4, 2017", "box_office": "$174.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It got me to chuckle a few times, director McGrath keeps things moving at a lively pace, and as far as family-friendly entertainment, it does the trick.", "The film's strength is Baldwin, who kills it in this movie and his comedic timing clearly shines through.", "It's a fun one for the family, with jokes for adults, too.", "It will keep younger viewers occupied with its colourful animation and silly fun for 90 odd minutes while giving their parents the occasional chuckle on its way to its predictable conclusion.", "This isn't a great movie, but it's a decent one. It's thin and clich\u00e9d, but it's sweet and fun.", "I can see The Boss Baby working as an animated short, similar to the opening of Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but there just isn't enough meat on the bones for a feature film.", "The Boss Baby is the loaded diaper of animated comedies", "Like my parenting methods, this is several great ideas that collapse into a bit of a mess when put into practice. Still, it's a useful watch for older siblings who may well identify with 7 year old Tim, feeling pushed out when his baby brother arrives.", "If you enjoy Baldwin's schtick, then Boss Baby should work for you regardless of your age. If not, well at least your children will have a good time.", "One has to really scrabble through the disparate parts to find most of the value, while the kids (as always) will really love the usual tricks.", "Forgettable toddler fodder film from a once creative animated studio that didn't only appeal to younger viewers.", "I have a little brother in real life, so this film should have grabbed my heartstrings and given them a good wring. But it didn't.", "It's certainly good for a giggle. There's absolutely nothing wrong with a little juvenile humor every now and then.", "Has the best \"where babies come from\" gag in a while, too.", "It wastes its very clever concept by reducing it into just a running gag instead of being a subtle commentary on current events or even contemporary corporate society, but that is probably too much to expect out of children's entertainment.", "Gorgeously animated in typically pin-sharp DreamWorks style, Tom McGrath keeps the laughs coming, with jokes that should appeal across the age range. Also contains puppies.", "The Boss Baby began with a lot of promise, like most babies. As usual, though, time passed and the baby got annoying.", "Of course many a good idea in Hollywood falters before the final reel. But this latest DreamWorks animation is more comforting than a warm bottle of baby milk.", "In the plots of children's films, finding an original idea is already a reason for applause...
