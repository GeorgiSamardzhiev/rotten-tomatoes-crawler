{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After newly widowed Julie Kohler's (Jeanne Moreau) mother stops her from commiting suicide, she hatches a different plan to deal with her grief. In a small black book, she lists five men. One by one she visits the men with murderous intentions, assuming different identities to get close to them. Only one man remains elusive, having been captured by the cops before Julie could reach him -- but despite the obstacles, Julie intends to see her task through to the end.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": "$42.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Though second-tier Truffaut, The Bride Wore Black remains an under-appreciated thriller that passes on Moreau's stellar performance and Coutard's roaming camera work.", "Moreau is mesmerizing as the avenging angel, and the manner in which she interacts with each priggish man offers a fascinating study in a particular brand of male-female dynamics.", "Truffaut suggests a nation straining to burst its carapace of moralism. The film's subject and its object converge in the same self-liberating social revolution that would shake the country the following year.", "With its summery, Mediterranean surface, Jeanne Moreau as the ultimate femme fatale heroine and a knife-twisting tale of murderous revenge and unexpected romance, \"The Bride Wore Black\" is well worth rediscovering.", "For all of Truffaut's digressive asides, deadpan gags, and lyrical cinephiliac touches, his slow-starting movie is overly schematic, emotionally shallow, and not so much fun.", "Unfortunately, Truffaut fell into a pit of awkwardness on the project; editingwise, he's hardly in the league of Hitchcock, his sequences rushing ahead, his ironies too obvious.", "A frigid and oddly static procession of Hitchcockian shout-outs that plays like an affected sequel to the two filmmakers' celebrated interview book.", "The Bride Wore Black finds a dark yet entertaining balance between B-movie conventions and (Truffaut's) European film sensibilities.", "It's an entertaining film even if it doesn't completely work.", "It's an enjoyable and entertaining film, albeit probably Truffaut's darkest and least sentimental work.", "Miss Moreau remains one of the screen's great actresses, and there is a supporting cast of unusual quality.", "", "", "It's accessible, intriguing and enjoyable.", "Truffaut is such a poetic filmmaker that the film turns around and becomes, not at all Hitchcockian, but a gentle comedy and one of the few plausible and strange love stories in a long time.", "A chilling and tragic portrait of fractured psychology and shattered lives.", "Basically an exercice de style, and a good one at that."], "rating": ["3/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "2/5", "2/4", "", "B-", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "4/5", "3/5", "", "", "3.5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "Matt Brunson", "Richard Brody", "Andrew O&#39;Hehir", "J.
