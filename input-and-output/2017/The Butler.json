{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After leaving the South as a young man and finding employment at an elite hotel in Washington, D.C., Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker) gets the opportunity of a lifetime when he is hired as a butler at the White House. Over the course of three decades, Cecil has a front-row seat to history and the inner workings of the Oval Office. However, his commitment to his \"First Family\" leads to tension at home, alienating his wife (Oprah Winfrey) and causing conflict with his anti-establishment son.", "rating": "72", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 12m", "director": "Lee Daniels", "studio": "LauraZiskinProductions", "theater_date": "Aug 16, 2013", "dvd_date": "Dec 16, 2016", "box_office": "$116.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["I appreciate The Butler for the editing (by Joe Clotz), the juxtaposition, and its black-centric lens.", "Behind a truly mesmerizing performance from Forest Whitaker, this is a film that is a thought-provoking and beautifully acted film.", "Not the most subtle of movies overall, but does offer some valid insights into the evolution of modern race relations in America.", "Because we've seen the elements of this genre before, the film severely telegraphs its emotional beats...Its only saving grace is the talent of the actors involved. Otherwise the film would fall flat on its face.", "A formidably cast epic that eclipses over seventy years of a man's life in a landsape of evolving racism, Daniels lets his material speak for itself, while history calls the shots.", "Though The Butler's tidy sentiments can be cloying, it's hard to remain unmoved-and unimpressed by the stubbornly authentic performances by Whitaker and Oprah, which will likely be remembered at Oscar time.", "There are missed opportunities and weak moments in the script to be sure, but not enough to discount it, and the stellar acting by Forest Whitaker is what will make this movie memorable longterm.", "It's an odd, uneven film, but there is a lot to like here.", "It's a shame that the excellent central storyline gets so obstructed and mucked up by all the noise, spectacle, and pageantry.", "Well done, and definitely worth seeing, but it falls short of the next-level greatness that it tries to achieve.", "Daniels' lack of self-awareness actually works in his favour here, letting the director's emotions run and resulting in a work that has fire in its belly beneath the shiny surface.", "It's a pedestrian script, with tons of exposition, tons of signalling, and jarring vernacular oddities... The Butler does not serve its own subject matter well.", "It's a course correction for the over-the-top Daniels, but history and The Butler may have been better served by the passion of his extreme tendencies.", "This is a tough line to walk, being both upfront with your message and managing subtle critiques, but luckily for viewers Daniels manages to find the right balance and deliver a winning movie.", "What's impressive and effective is a look at a recent history through the eyes of a humble man just happy to provide for his family.", "The overwhelming feeling is that Allen's story was not good enough for the makers of this shiny, overproduced biopic, so they have Forrest Gumpified everything beyond belief.", "With Oscar winner Forest Whitaker fully embracing the project and an impressive ensemble cast that brings to life America's dark racist past, Lee Daniels' The Butler is significant.", "The film paints a disturbing and expansive portrait of the civil rights movement-from Jim Crow's \"separate but equal\" charade and demonstrations, to forced desegregation and the eventual victory of an African American in the White House.", "The Butler has some wonderful moments that are powerful and moving, but its scope will ultimately (and unfortunately) polarize its audience.", "Daniels does a good job of portraying the period in a warm, moving and righteous manner."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "6.6", "", "3/5", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "3/5", "B", "7.5/10", "", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nijla Mu&#39;min", "Richard Propes", "Leigh Paatsch", "Damond Fudge", "Nicholas Bell", "Brian D.
