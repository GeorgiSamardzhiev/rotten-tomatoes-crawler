But the big surprise is that the decidedly odd, bromantic friendship at the movie's heart should prove so touching.", "Whatever the real truth is, this ride is full of laughs.", "The Disaster Artist truly captures how the struggle for success shaped 'The Room,' the infamous disaster film we've come to love.", "It's a film about the making of the film and the cult of personality that turned that otherwise disastrous film into an unexpected money maker.", "...unfortunately, The Disaster Artist is also something of a vanity project for Franco, and a bit too much of an in-joke.", "It's not enough to glean any real insight, but it's just enough to entertain.", "The Disaster Artist is a fascinating character study of a delusional obsessive...it's not so much about the making of this cult film as it is about following your passions, no matter what, and accepting where that path leads you.", "An oddball love letter to movies, a fascinating crowd-pleaser, and a surprisingly sweet story of passion and friendship.", "[T]he decision to film Disaster as a comedy relegates the characters' moral objections to fodder for the funnies.", "The audacity of Wiseau carries the film for a bit, but we never get his full background or how he got a cool 6 mill for such an inert, softcore bore.", "t's an underdog story that ultimately has the last laugh, given we're watching James Franco recreate Tommy's life for a film that has become the dark horse this awards season.", "If you've never seen The Room, don't try to figure out the phenomenon; simply enjoy witnessing the [creation] of it. And if you are, in fact, a Room devotee, prepare to laugh harder than you have ever laughed in your life.", "What it all amounts to is a tremendously funny feel good film that doesn't quite stand on its own so much as it plays as a great (the BEST, really) companion-piece to The Room that a cult film fan could ask for.", "The Disaster Artist is undeniably fun, but just skin deep.", "Franco is all business portraying it's writer, director, producer and possible vampire and his strange behavior during the making of the movie. Oscar nomination for Franco? Better be. Oscar nomination for the movie? Possibly.", "By directing and acting in a movie about a bad actor/director, Franco the movie star made himself vulnerable -- and created the best film of his career.", "This is one of the funniest movies ever made. James Franco should be nominated for an Oscar for his performance. The film is non-stop laughter, with a few serious moments. I loved it.", "The Disaster Artist is unique, off kilter and strangely inspiring in the end. To his credit, it's a movie only a fellow wierdo like James Franco could make. Go see it.", "With this film, Tommy Wiseau has become famous again. He's selling Wiseau underwear and going on tour. He may be a Disaster Artist but with [James] Franco's help, he's having the last laugh."], "rating": ["4/5", "4/5", "8/10", "4.5/5", "3.5/4", "", "3.5/5", "", "B+", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "", "3/5", "3/5", "", "", "4.5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Jason Best", "Mike Massie", "Leigh Monson", "Richard Propes", "Joanne Laurier", "Matt Cipolla", "Damond Fudge", "Brent McKnight", "CJ Sheu", "Tom Meek", "Dan Tabor", "Steven Prokopy", "Dan Scully", "Jorge Ignacio Castillo", "Shawn Edwards", "Chris McCoy", "Sarah Knight Adamson", "Grethe Kemp", "Linda and Al Lerner"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">What&#39;s On TV", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Substream Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Monthly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KCCI (Des Moines, IA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Critics at Large", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cambridge Day", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Phawker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Third Coast Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema76", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Canadian Crew", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fox 4 Kansas City", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AWFJ Women on Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Channel24 (South Africa)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies and Shakers"], "date": ["February 3, 2021", "December 20, 2020", "December 5, 2020", "October 2, 2020", "September 6, 2020", "August 27, 2020", "July 23, 2020", "July 17, 2020", "July 1, 2020", "June 30, 2020", "June 22, 2020", "May 29, 2020", "May 20, 2020", "March 24, 2020", "January 27, 2020", "January 22, 2020", "January 16, 2020", "January 13, 2020", "January 7, 2020", "October 10, 2019"]}}
