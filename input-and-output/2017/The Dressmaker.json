The top-notch cast is led by Kate Winslet...", "The Dressmaker contains enough plot twists and mood changes for a whole season of TV drama.", "It could become this cult-y camp classic. It's there.", "I had so much fun in this movie. It was so silly, bonkers, twisted, fun.", "Despite its getting lost in the final act, the movie manages to be enticing and darkly humorous to the core. Not a bad entry from Down Under.", "Watching this mostly gentile outing morph rather magically into a subversive revenge comedy left me reeling at first, then laughing very loudly indeed.", "'The Dressmaker' needs some alterations.", "What stops The Dressmaker from being a stand out film is the storytelling itself: important facts that would have made for intriguing clues are left to the last minute, costing it that finesse which could have made it great.", "It continually surprised me and all the performances are so campy and fun that it worked.", "The Dressmaker is a peculiar little offering from Australia that matches elements of drama with farce.", "You can't accuse The Dressmaker of putting style over substance because it has both in spades.", "The Dressmaker wagers that its audience might only get out to see one film in theaters this year, so it should cram all the genres they love into its two-hour runtime.", "While I wish the story could have been a bit more balanced, \"The Dressmaker\" boasts great performances by all involved and cashes in on its silly, and occasionally dark, humor.", "The best thing about The Dressmaker is, of course, Kate Winslet. The plot is over-complicated and includes a wedding, a funeral, an ambitious death count, drugs and alcohol, dueling dressmakers, and a grand finale theatrical extravaganza.", "Gives ample room for the talents of the wonderful Judy Davis.", "I loved the idea -- and indeed its stunning visualisation... but that's not enough to sustain a film that is criminally overlong and wastes several opportunities to come to a close. Winslet, however, is fab.", "Without Kate Winslet's on-screen presence, this small, quirky Australian film is unlikely to gain any traction.", "When a movie invites you to question its very reason for being, there's something wrong in the design."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "", "3.5/5", "2/4", "3/5", "B+", "", "3.5/5", "", "3/5", "6.5/10", "B", "3/5", "2/5", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Bax", "Andrew F.
