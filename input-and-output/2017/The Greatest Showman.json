{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Growing up in the early 1800s, P.T. Barnum displays a natural talent for publicity and promotion, selling lottery tickets by age 12. After trying his hands at various jobs, P.T. turns to show business to indulge his limitless imagination, rising from nothing to create the Barnum & Bailey circus. Featuring catchy musical numbers, exotic performers and daring acrobatic feats, Barnum's mesmerizing spectacle soon takes the world by storm to become the greatest show on Earth.", "rating": "57", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Michael Gracey", "studio": "CherninEntertainment,TwentiethCenturyFox,TSGEntertainment", "theater_date": "Dec 20, 2017", "dvd_date": "Dec 22, 2017", "box_office": "$174.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's a rollercoaster of story and music that occasionally moves too fast but delivers enough thrills along the way to be worth the price of admission.", "A serious look at P.T. Barnum's life requires acknowledgment of the ways in which his success manifested. The Greatest Showman is therefore just as much of a fraud as he was.", "While one can fault this sugar-coated take on the Barnum character, it's hard to find fault with Jackman's portrayal of him.", "Hugh Jackman dazzles as circus tycoon P.T. Barnum in this criminally underrated biopic featuring a timeless Pasek & Paul songbook of \"A Million Dreams\" and \"Never Enough.\"", "It won't be classified as the best movie in the world (or musical for that matter) but it is easy to see why the appeal for the film has been infectious and unanimous.", "A festive musical treat with an enchanting performance from Jackman and a feel-good soundtrack you'll be hunting down as soon as you leave the cinema.", "What is said to be a 'celebration of humanity' lacks just that, using flair and manipulation instead.", "The Greatest Showman is a spectacular modern musical extravaganza in the classic Hollywood style.", "Thinking back on this film is giving me a headache. It is a frustrating mess, with much to mock. However, I do admit to being swept along with some of the musical numbers and circus scenes. Ultimately I have to accept that a large part of me enjoyed it.", "This movie does a solid job of presenting its story and providing a fantastic place for these new songs.", "This movie does still suffer from a lot of the same problems, musically, that La La Land did, where I can't understand a word that the chorus is saying.", "It had that magic of a musical... I don't know if I'd recommend it. It felt like it was peacocking me the whole time.", "This isn't a subtle, finely tuned piece of art, this is cheery lunacy that revels in its attempt to call back on the positive musicals of the past.", "My question is, why not focus on the real facts by digging deeper? What a shame, not only to Barnum's character but also to Lind's.", "The Greatest Showman is so much fun. You got Hugh Jackman's contagious charisma, Zac Efron holding his own and Zendaya flying through the air with ease.", "This film may not be the greatest show, but in this film, [Hugh] Jackman is the greatest showman.", "It is true that the entire technical department is essential for 'The Great Showman' to become what it is, but everything would have been in vain without Jackman's fundamental presence.
