She's known for making heavy dramas and period pieces, but I love seeing her in a lighter, more comedic movie...", "Not much more than a trans-Atlantic take on the same gloopy matters addressed by Love Actually, but it an effective date movie nonetheless.", "While some people might accuse Meyers of sleepwalking in her latest film, The Holiday, it still worked for me thanks to a likable cast and some rather smart dialogue.", "A great example of an affable rom-com. [Full Review in Spanish]", "You begin to suspect that Meyers isn't actually a movie director at all, but a features coordinator at World of Interiors.", "Nancy Meyers pulls off a classic comedy tribute...the cast pull it off, selling their characters' singlehood, nailing their occasional sight gags and earning our laughs and tears, which often occur in the same scene.", "The Holiday is what you want out of a romantic comedy, without expecting the moon.", "Nancy Meyers is a whiz at turning out fun, frothy commercial fare.", "Grindingly predictable and sickeningly convenient, it's as false as a plastic tree.", "The Holiday is as corny as it gets, but in a cinemascape full of macho grunting and aggressive irony, Meyers is perhaps right to believe that corniness is what women - and their boyfriends - will be wanting...", "Isn't it reassuring to know in these troubled times that it's possible for gorgeous rich people to find love?", "Each scene in The Holiday is more annoying than the last.", "One of the best date movies I have seen this year.", "Who cares if the housing-swap conceit makes little to no sense?", "What makes The Holiday interesting - and worth reexamining more than a decade after its release - is that unlike most holiday-themed movies, it exhorts the viewer to take time for themselves, not just others. It's the ultimate self-care flick.", "If you're looking for a good movie, I don't recommend this one, but if you want something fun that you can still understand after vaping all afternoon, \"The Holiday\" is perfect.", "Even with the beautiful view, this is one holiday I wish I hadn't taken.", "A reminder to all producers: alluding to iconic romantic comedies in a bid for legitimacy can be a dangerous game, even when you have appealing stars.", "Patronizing antimatter"], "rating": ["2/5", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "3/4", "", "2/5", "", "", "", "B+", "", "", "", "", "2/4", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["PJ Nabarro", "Paul McGuire Grimes", "Leigh Paatsch", "Micheal Compton", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Anthony Quinn", "Glenn Sumi", "Michael Smith", "Leah Rozen", "Elliott Noble", "Sukhdev Sandhu", "Nicholas Barber", "Lindy West", "Neil Miller", "Bridget Read", "Anne Cohen", "Lindsay Pugh", "Sarah Keenlyside", "Brooke Holgerson", "Fernando F.
