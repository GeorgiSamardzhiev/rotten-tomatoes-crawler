The humor, the dialogues that bear the stamp of sobriety and a very intriguing plot keeps it away from artifice. [Full review in Spanish]", "... a well-tuned character piece starring screen legend Jean Rochefort and French pop icon Johnny Hallyday as strangers with nothing in common whose chance meeting sparks a powerful friendship.", "The Man On The Train uses the genre of the crime film to explore the existential crisis of masculinity, and the conclusion it reaches is a similarly bleak affirmation of the codes of heroism.", "Laconte's direction is calculative all the way, but his telling fails to register very much.", "", "A bizarre yet touching tale of gangster and recluse finding in each other something they lack, the film definitely warrants a look.", "You get the feeling you are watching the adaptation of a classic novel, when in fact the script is an original work of impressive poetry and unpredictable dialogue...", "", "An exceptionally crafted western dream.", "Thought-provoking, tender and funny, far better than your average 'one last score' film.", "Although Leconte leads his characters to a baffling conclusion, he creates a satisfying portrayal of two old would-be cowboys heading for what could be the last roundup", "It's a poetic and keenly observed story.", "", "Lacking the sweep of The Widow of St. Pierre and the audacity of The Girl on the Bridge, here Leconte seems to be working on a character sketch...", "Bleak, blue lighting and washed out colours emphasise the wintriness of the tale; but there isn't nearly enough dramatic conflict to sustain this to feature length.", "It's nice to see a film about the regrets of old age that doesn't resort to Grumpy Old Men-style humor or cheap action sequences.", "A collision of cultures--a movie in love with movies, literature, poetry and music, but not to the point of worship or distraction.", "Combine the elegiac Sam Peckinpah of The Wild Bunch and the fatalistic Jean-Pierre Melville of Le Samourai or Le Flic and the result might well be The Man on the Train, director Patrice Leconte's 20th film.", "This is a film that delivers in layers. The top, and most easily accessed, is that of an enjoyable human drama.
