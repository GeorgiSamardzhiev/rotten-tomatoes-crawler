{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) has been in the role of Santa for the past eight years, and his loyal elves consider him the best one ever. But the world of the \"Merry Old Soul\" turns upside down when he's dealt a double whammy of news: Not only has his son, Charlie (Eric Lloyd), landed on this year's naughty list, but Scott discovers that he must marry by Christmas Eve -- just a month away! -- or he will stop being Santa Claus forever.", "rating": "56", "genre": "Comedy/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Michael Lembeck", "studio": "BuenaVista(WaltDisney)", "theater_date": "Nov 1, 2002", "dvd_date": "Dec 5, 2016", "box_office": "$139.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["On Dasher, Dancer, Prancer and Vixen!

If you want a cranky Christmas, there's always Bad Santa. It's also not as funny as the original, but it's still entertaining.", "Sweet? Yes. Sentimental? You bet. But like all the best Christmas pictures, this doesn't let the schmaltz swamp the wit or the charm - and has a sledload of both.", "Despite the obviously mercenary nature of this sequel, there's a thimbleful of clever ideas at work here, most notably in the way Allen's RoboSanta begins to turn his toy factory into a tiny dictatorship.", "A rancid Christmas.
