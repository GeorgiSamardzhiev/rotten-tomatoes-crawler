{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In Italy, small-town newlyweds Wanda (Brunella Bovo) and Ivan Cavalli (Leopoldo Trieste) embark on their honeymoon in the big city of Rome. Ivan dutifully wants to keep appointments with family and church, but Wanda is only interested in meeting her favorite photo-strip star known as \"The White Sheik\" (Alberto Sordi). While Wanda impetuously sneaks away to locate the object of her affections, disconsolate Ivan tries his hardest to keep up appearances with the couple's relatives.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Art House & International/Classics/Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 23m", "director": "Federico Fellini", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 29, 2003", "box_office": "$50.8K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Possibly [Federico Fellini's] sweetest, mildest, lightest, and most charming screwball comedy.", "The White Sheik is definitely worth seeing.
