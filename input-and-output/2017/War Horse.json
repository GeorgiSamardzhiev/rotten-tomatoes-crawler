[Full review in Spanish]", "For the most part this film is very manipulative with how it's trying to tug at your feelings. Most are going to call this one of the best films of the season or year but while this picture is executed superbly it's not really earned its heart one bit.", "For all his impact, Spielberg doesn't know when to apply the brakes and undermines his own efforts with ham-fisted and often cloying flourishes.", "War Horse left me strangely and definitively unmoved on every level...", "Almost as if Spielberg is performing surgery with a sledgehammer, constantly bashing the audience over the head with imagery and dialogue tailor-made to inform us how to feel at any given moment.", "There are times when War Horse seems like an odd mash-up of sensibilities, but overall, for horse lovers who can handle war movies, or for war movie lovers who can handle horse stories, it's a welcome Christmas present.", "War Horse is a moving tribute not just to the unsung heroes of the First World War -- horses -- but also the men who bravely fought alongside them.", "One of Spielberg's most inspiring, enjoyable efforts of the last twenty years.", "This is always emotionally obvious, as well as consistently predictable. Something important has been lost in translation that cannot be compensated for by realism or pictorial beauty.", "War Horse is a highly emotive, undeniably sentimental film, but for those who have been raised on Spielberg's canon, this sentimentality is something to be relished and enjoyed.", "\"War Horse\" is top-heavy with ambition, little of which really pays off.", "All the sumptuous pomp and sweep add up to little more than an inflated remake of Lassie Come Home, a step backwards from his mostly splendid mature films that feels closer to the labored and hollow Spielberg pastiche of Super 8.", "Extremely unsatisfying ending. And not better than The Black Stallion.", "As engaging as \"War Horse\" is, and it is engaging, Spielberg oftentimes resorts to big, John Williams' music-enhanced, wide-screen moments to manipulate the emotion that the story should have been able to elicit on its own.", "War Horse has an unapologetically nostalgic feel which will appeal to an older audience.", "War Horse is about war, and it is about the ways that animals can teach us to be more human. It's too long, but it is inspiring.", "Etched in the simple, bold strokes of a passed-down fable. Resistance is futile.", "Steven Spielberg's \"War Horse\" is an imperfect film, but certainly is a beautiful one."], "rating": ["4/10", "3.0/4", "7/10", "C+", "2.2/5", "2.5/5", "2/4", "B+", "3/4", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "3.5/5", "", "", "7/10"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Yasser Medina", "Julian Lytle", "David Harris", "Kate Rodger", "Matthew Lucas", "Abbie Bernstein", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "Daniel Green", "Deborah Ross", "Joseph Walsh", "Steve Erickson", "Fernando F.
