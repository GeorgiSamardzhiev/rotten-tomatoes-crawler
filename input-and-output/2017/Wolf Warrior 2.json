And I love that part of this story.

But its sheer moral ineptitude combined with its throwback B-movie tone makes it one of the most unintentionally hilarious films of the year.", "Wolf Warrior 2 allows the action to thrill even when the overstuffed plot is trying to subvert the more exciting aspects of the film.", "Its corny display of nationalist pride aside, Wu's superior sequel to the laughably scripted Wolf Warrior should at least satisfy genre audiences with its slam-bang action.", "It scratches that '80s action film itch better than the great majority of '80s action films do.", "A Chinese variation on the white savior myth, but also a slam-bang action spectacular.", "This is a fun, if crazily over-the-top, experience. And if you have been raised on Hollywood fare, it's unsettling to see the good-versus-evil match-up from the Chinese perspective.", "Wu Jing's record-breaking Chinese-produced action-adventure gives audiences plenty of bang for their bucks.", "Wolf Warrior 2 lectures you, pummels you, and then expects you to cheer.", "While it's an upgrade over the first outing, Wolf Warrior II never breaks out of its B-movie niche.", "Wolf Warrior 2 is even bigger and bolder than its predecessor, which doesn't always work in its favor. But genre fans will definitely relish the near constant barrage of elaborate set pieces that are choreographed and filmed for maximum impact.", "While \"Wolf Warrior 2\" is blandly generic more often than not, there's something bracing about its patriotic fervor, which asserts that the Chinese will act in the best interests of the world's downtrodden, while the rest of the world just exploits them.", "Issues are minor in comparison to what it gets right, and what it gets right is the action... the occasionally brutal, frequently ridiculous, always entertaining action."], "rating": ["", "3.5/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3.5/5", "6.0/10", "3/5", "", "1/4", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Ed Travis", "Harris Dang", "Sean Mulvihill", "Edmund Lee", "Tim Brayton", "Scott Mendelson", "John Lui", "Joe Leydon", "Simon Abrams", "Daniel Eagan", "Frank Scheck", "Noel Murray", "Rob Hunter"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinapse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">easternKicks.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">FanboyNation.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South China Morning Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternate Ending", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Forbes", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Straits Times (Singapore)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">RogerEbert.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Journal International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film School Rejects"], "date": ["November 2, 2018", "October 31, 2018", "October 31, 2018", "September 5, 2017", "August 19, 2017", "August 17, 2017", "August 16, 2017", "August 12, 2017", "August 7, 2017", "July 27, 2017", "July 27, 2017", "July 27, 2017", "July 27, 2017"]}}
