Gene Wilder's performance is one for the ages. [Full review in Spanish]", "Miracles still happen: Mel Brooks has made a funny movie.", "Young Frankenstein is sharply littered with slapstick humour, double entendre meanings and witty dialogue, thanks to the efforts of Wilder and Brooks.", "It would seem that nothing new or noteworthy could still be gleaned from the Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley creation, but Mel Brooks with Young Frankenstein has done just that.", "What it demonstrates is that for spoof to work, the spoofers must have deep affection for the material out of which they are wringing the wee.", "This loopy send-up of classic chiller clich\u00e9s from Universal's monster heyday is one of director Mel Brooks's best comedies, and it's also one of the genre's most thorough and successful fright film parodies.", "Brooks has never been as inspired as in this movie, at the service of the viewer, for whom the seventh art was created. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Puttin' on the ritz.", "Cloris Leachman and Madeline Kahn are also a riot in their roles.", "The ability of corny and literal gags to land on internationally diverse ears was infectious and heart-warming. It is also one of the most stunning black and white digital restorations I have seen.", "The dream team of writer/director Mel Brooks and writer/star Gene Wilder know the text, the tropes and the best ways to turn them into comedy.", "It's Mel Brooks at his most daft and puerile: sophisticated and silly, a black-and-white art film with schlong jokes.", "Well worth a watch.", "The Brooks of 'Young Frankenstein' isn't really skewering the conventions of the horror movie - he's paying tribute to them, and using them as scaffolding for his particular brand of goofy, Borscht Belt burlesque.", "It is good-natured, lowbrow, backlot, hit-or-miss humor, but with no cumulative effect beyond its succession of hard-worked jokes.", "... Brooks reveal(s) himself a true obsd and an honorable heir to the eerily delicate comic-horror tradition of James Whale.", "It's a wonderful, iconic comedy. Mel Brooks' masterpiece!", "One of Mel Brooks' most brilliant and immortal cinematic works to date...", "Wilder's hysteria seems perfectly natural. You never question what's driving him to it; his fits are lucid and total.
