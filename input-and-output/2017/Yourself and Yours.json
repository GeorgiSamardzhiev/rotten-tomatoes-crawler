{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A jealous Youngsoo confronts girlfriend Minjung about another man, and she suggests they stop seeing each other for a while.

For me, it is Hong's most relatable observation of love.", "That there are numerous ways to view her and the story makes it one of Hong's most powerful and engrossing films.", "One of Hong's most lovingly nuanced works, a film filled with longing and regret that finds great beauty in the in-between moments.", "It has a catchy droll humor, if nothing else.", "Pure romance, a woman going to bizarre and baffling lengths to get the man she wants, as much The Lady Eve or A Woman is a Woman as That Obscure Object of Desire.", "I found myself engaged and entertained watching these individuals explore and embrace important realizations that will serve them well and that offer vital reminders for all of us.", "Longtime fans of the filmmaker may enjoy the change of pace.", "Fresh and enchanting, by turns delicate, romantic, mysterious, witty and crushing.", "The film delivers an entirely off-kilter sensation (as, some would say, does love).", "An exhausting, and mostly frustrating display of emotional scab-picking.", "Hong's formal confidence yields a movie that's very simply constructed and utterly engrossing.", "The dialogue is as sharp and multifaceted as ever, and the supporting work provides quite a bit of levity.", "\"Yourself and Yours\" may lack the depth and artistry of \"Right Now, Wrong Then\", but is definitely more entertaining.", "... Hong Sang-soo makes the best movie of the year. Just like every year. [Full review in Spanish]", "Witty, strange and hard.", "... Yourself and Yours is closer to a Rohmerian moral tale, with a single narrative track containing a situation that leads to personal self-discovery.", "By re-asserting Min-jung's agency throughout, Hong toys with those who accuse him of complacency. Here behavioural response and re-evaluation is felt, rather than studied."], "rating": ["", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "3.5/4", "B-", "", "", "B-", "", "4", "2/4", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "", "R"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Scott Nye", "Andrew Heskins", "Janet Lee", "Soham Gadre", "Jenny Nulf", "Matthew Lucas", "Dennis Schwartz", "Sean Gilman", "Diane Carson", "Mike D&#39;Angelo", "Mark Olsen", "Hope Madden", "Simon Abrams", "Glenn Kenny", "Tomas Trussow", "Panos Kotzathanasis", "Daniel de Partearroyo", "A.S.
