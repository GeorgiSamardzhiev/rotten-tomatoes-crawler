Based on Hanff's epistolary memoir and its later two-person stage adaptation, the film version incorporates new characters, including Doel's wife, Nora (Judi Dench).", "rating": "87", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "David Jones", "studio": "Brooksfilms,ColumbiaPicturesCorporation", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 20, 2012", "box_office": "$572.7K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["\"84 Charing Cross Road\" is a valuable film for all of the right reasons of theatrical balance and narrative truth.
