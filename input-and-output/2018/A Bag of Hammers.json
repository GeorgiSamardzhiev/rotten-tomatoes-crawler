In a good way.", "The real scam was the filmmakers tricking Rebecca Hall (and a cameoing Amanda Seyfried) into participating in this blunt instrument of an indie.", "Most of it seems baffled and unclear. Some nice ideas floating around in here, but A Bag of Hammers is one of the few movies I can remember that appears to be composed mainly of outtakes.", "A few striking performances-Ritter, Preston, and Canterbury are especially great-smooth out what might have been a much bumpier ride.", "Suffers from both an odd, ineffective structure and a low-key tone that jars uncomfortably with the subject matter and makes the film's stakes seem unnecessary low.", "Well-meaning but innocuous.", "Happy, uncynical, and heartfelt, so gosh-darned likable that any flaws in its methods are easily overlooked.", "First-time feature helmer Brian Crano maneuvers some tricky tonal shifts with impressive ease in A Bag of Hammers, a droll, quirky comedy with a pleasant amount of heart."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "", "", "5/10", "3/5", "1.5/5", "6.3/10", "2/4", "1.5/5", "3/5", "6.5/10", "B-", "", "1/5", "", "", "2/4", "C", "B", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Ed Travis", "Neely Swanson", "James Plath", "Jules Brenner", "Robert Abele", "Maryann Koopman Kelly", "Lou Lumenick", "Andy Webster", "Elizabeth Weitzman", "Alison Willmore", "Scott Tobias", "Marshall Fine", "Nick Schager", "Rex Reed", "Michelle Orange", "Andrew Schenker", "Harvey S.
