Carlos buys a truck to begin working as a self-employed man and earn more money, but when it is stolen, his hopes for a more affluent life are dashed.

It is the summer, anti-blockbuster movie I am recommending to everyone.", "The stakes are high in A Better Life and Bichir matches the film's tormented tone with a portrayal of a man overcome by both fear and faith.", "...Weitz finds a third character in the form of the L.A. landscape. Appearing entirely Eden-like when we're in the gardens with Carlos, but rundown and seedy when he's in his own element, the city assumes all the dimensions of the American dream itself.", "The film's beautiful simplicity is carried massively on the work of Demin Bichir, instantly and surely one of the best performances seen in 2011.", "Well-acted, but quite over-hyped -- a melodramatic Mexican-American version of \"Bicycle Thieves.\"", "A Better Life is a half-step removed from the Hallmark Hall of Fame.", "A Better Life's sense of place and eye for detail are strong, but the too-smooth style and rushed dramatics are at odds with the hardscrabble existence on display.", "[A] gentle, honest, heartfelt film, but [it] does not have much to offer beyond an earnest respect for a segment of American society that is too often derided...", "The silver lining is an excellent lead performance from Bichir.", "A well deserved Oscar nomination for Demian Bichir in a film with echoes of The Bicycle Thief.", "Each sequence plays out in mind-numbingly cliched fashion: father-son lectures, chin-up resilience-especially the final shot-and a stern message about the heartless anti-immigration movement are depicted in an infuriatingly shallow manner.", "Director Chris Weitz has done a credible job of bringing Roger Simon's story and Eric Eason's screenplay to cinematic life.", "it's far too predictable and mundane to carry my interest through the rest of the film", "Although the structure of the film is conventional, the ending of the film is not. Unlike most films, it does have a real hero, Carlos.", "A sympathetic tale about an illegal Mexican.", "Essentially a variation on Vittorio De Sica's The Bicycle Thief, but it has a vitality and resonance all its own.", "Modest as A Better Life may be in scope, it commits wholeheartedly to achieving the goal of socially conscious cinema: to make visible the previously unseen.", "A movingly simple and simply moving father-son drama set in downtown LA, refreshingly free of pretentious narrative pyrotechnics.
