The filmmaking is so on point that you'll find yourself also being completely silent in your seat...", "\"A Quiet Place\" feels like a very personal triumph for Krasinski... It will - and should - mark his arrival as one of Hollywood's most exciting new genre talents.", "The use of foreshadowing is masterfully orchestrated, prying extra tension from an already white-knuckle series of chills.", "A truly ingenious idea realized by a gifted writer-director-star in John Krasinski.", "Krasinski and his team of writers keep this as naturalistic as possible as to what could happen to this family and the survival skills they need to carry out.", "A Quiet Place seems destined to become a modern day horror classic.", "If \"Get Out\" proved why we should still \"get out\" to the theater during our streaming era, \"A Quiet Place\" proves the thrill of sitting quiet in an audience holding our collective breath.", "The film might come off more like a gimmick movie than much else for sequences of its runtime, but it remains a welcome change of pace in our era of deafening studio filmmaking.", "A thrilling film that celebrates disability. It is an exciting, terrifying, film that had me at the edge of my seat the entire time. I highly suggest you see it and support a powerful movie that puts a deaf girl at its center.", "It makes the most of its concept by squeezing your most primal fears in a creative and intelligent way. [Full review in Spanish]", "A Quiet Place begins and ends on masterful notes, the cool concept mostly delivers, the tension never lets up, the actors all work at high levels, it's gorgeous to look at, and every element wraps into a tight horror ball.", "The film is more than just a monster attack movie. It's a story about family, about trying to survive and protect them during an outrageously dangerous situation, and about how ... the right words can go unspoken.", "A Quiet Place is a masterpiece.", "The concept for the movie is so basic you would think it was uninspired and couldn't possibly be any good but you would be wrong.", "A familiar premise is redeemed by a nifty gimmick in this suspenseful horror thriller.", "Tight editing builds the suspense in this excellent horror film.", "A polished slice of fear inducing genre fare.
