Among the group are Gigi (Luigi Diberti) and Carletto (Nino Bignamini), two country boys who are overwhelmed by urban living. While some of the transplants find work at a hectic restaurant, others are employed at a grim slaughterhouse. When some of the migrant workers are unable to make ends meet, they resort to theft, making their situations even worse.", "rating": "", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Lina Wertm\u00fcller", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 5, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There are slithers into sentimentality even here, a frequent sense that poverty is not only a grinding plight but also a moral alibi, but generally this is a finely balanced film.", "[A] tiresome Lina Wertmller comedy."], "rating": ["", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Michael Wood", "Dave Kehr"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The New York Review of Books", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader"], "date": ["April 4, 2018", "May 11, 2017"]}}
