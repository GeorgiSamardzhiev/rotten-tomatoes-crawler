{"metadata": {"synopsis": "U.S. Navy SEAL Chris Kyle (Bradley Cooper) takes his sole mission -- protect his comrades -- to heart and becomes one of the most lethal snipers in American history. His pinpoint accuracy not only saves countless lives but also makes him a prime target of insurgents. Despite grave danger and his struggle to be a good husband and father to his family back in the States, Kyle serves four tours of duty in Iraq. However, when he finally returns home, he finds that he cannot leave the war behind.", "rating": "72", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "2h 12m", "director": "Clint Eastwood", "studio": "MadChance,MalpasoCompany,22nd&amp;Indiana", "theater_date": "Jan 16, 2015", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$350.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The promotion and defense of Clint Eastwood's American Sniper is the latest means by which the political and media establishment in the US is pursuing its militaristic agenda.", "Overall the movie feels like a well intentioned but shallow salute to the men and women who go to war.", "While all the performances are believable, Cooper's lines of dialogue are delivered with such indistinct enunciations that it's regularly difficult to make out his comments.", "I enjoyed it well enough and it had me interested and at the edge of my seat from the start...", "American Sniper is a flawed yet fantastic film.", "The greatest victims of any war are children and the director captures it with one of the most brutal sequences ever seen on a screen, in which a drill leaves an indelible memory. [Full Review in Spanish]", "There's nothing the least bit expressive or off-putting in Eastwood's lighting or framing. He understands classical film grammar and knows how to deploy it to maximum emotional effect.", "Clint Eastwood's sturdy, yet simplistic American Sniper doesn't really probe the depths of a Navy SEAL who reportedly killed 160 enemies in Iraq.", "This is a story that requires more than basic competence.", "The script and direction are unabashedly skewed towards feeding a lowest-common-denominator notion of war heroes and takes a righteous stand in favour of war, rather than exploring or portraying an authentic picture of the psychological impact...", "It is fitting, then, that such a quintessentially American director, who through his film personas has become something of a symbol of American masculinity, should be the one to so thoroughly deconstruct it on screen.", "A dreary, teary-eyed salute to the American flag.", "It's brutal but I'm glad I saw it.", "Cooper nails the Texas drawl and makes a compelling patriot, elevating the film beyond ordinary.", "Eastwood and Cooper's depiction of post-traumatic stress disorder is superb.", "For many, I suspect, American Sniper may be weirdly liberating-gratifying a perhaps hitherto unsuspected desire to see their pessimism, hopeless and unchanging, projected on the screen.", "Cooper embodies the battle-weary soldier well enough - the actor has buffed himself up considerably and he definitely has charisma to spare and he carries the film with ease.", "American Sniper honors the memory of Chris Kyle, an exemplary life of service and sacrifice.", "When \"American Sniper\" is on the battlefield, it is at its best. Eastwood has a keen sense of pacing for those moments, bringing an intensity that is as great as any film in the genre.", "American Sniper es un estremecedor retrato sobre la responsabilidad y el patriotismo de un hombre con su pa\u00eds impulsado por la fant\u00e1stica personificaci\u00f3n de Bradley Cooper"], "rating": ["", "3/5", "5/10", "7/10", "3.5/4", "", "", "2.5/5", "", "", "3.5/4", "2/5", "A", "7/10", "8/10", "", "", "", "B", "8"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "Tony Asankomah", "Richard Propes", "Alberto Abu\u00edn", "Chris McCoy", "David Harris", "Patrick Bromley", "Udita Jhunjhunwala", "Matthew Lucas", "Tom Bond", "Rachel Wagner", "Julie Crawford", "Bernard Boo", "J.
