A comic battle of wills breaks out between the pair as they prepare for the blessed event and try not to kill one another in the process.", "rating": "63", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 39m", "director": "Michael McCullers", "studio": "Michaels/Goldwyn", "theater_date": "Apr 25, 2008", "dvd_date": "Jun 15, 2012", "box_office": "$60.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Not a complete waste of time, Poehler has some inspired moments, but it is a big waste of a talented cast.", "Fey is easily one of the most intelligent and funny actresses working in comedy today.", "Baby Mama's principal issue is in not being written by Fey.", "While this comedy does have a few mild laughs, it mostly misfires, thanks to a script that is nowhere near the talent level of its cast.", "While the proceedings may be predictable and pockmarked with clich\u00e9s, the compulsive watchability of the film's stars makes it a minor success.", "When Baby Mama is funny, it's funny.", "With a cast this great, is it so selfish to ask for something memorable?", "Baby Mama is far more funny than it has any right to be and boasts a dynamite pairing that shows plenty of promise for the future: here's hoping Fey and Poehler pick something a little less formulaic for their next project.", "Fey and Poehler have great chemistry and they truly compliment each other well", "", "", "This is one of those terrible terrible creations that just leaves me feeling a little uneasy about the way the film industry works.", "Fey and Pohler are an appealing pair, with Fey's wry, deadpan delivery a perfect complement to Poehler's fearlessly juvenile brand of humor.", "The reason this movie works so well though, is similar to why a good romantic comedy works.
