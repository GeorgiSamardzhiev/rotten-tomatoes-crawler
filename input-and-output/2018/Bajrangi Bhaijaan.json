It's also unashamedly manipulative. But it works.", "As far as stories go, this is simple enough. And in its very simplicity, Bajrangi Bhaijaan tugs at the heartstrings.", "Kabir Khan's attempts to foster bonhomie and empathy between the great subcontinental rivals are as touching as they are earnest.", "Overall, Bajrangi Bhaijaan is an average film vying to be a great one. For Salman fans, this is not exactly a disappointment.", "With high expectations surrounding the film's release, it manages to deliver on most counts.", "It remains the kind of package perhaps only Bollywood could now pull together: a movie that feels calculated in its grand design, and yet which plays as wholly sincere and heartfelt on a scene-by-scene basis.", "This film is a total package.", "Got an emotional jugular? Bajrangi Bhaijaan is coming for you, hammer and tongs.", "With Bajrangi, you meet a whole new Salman -- this is not the shirt-ripping, ab-flaunting, dialogue-maro-ing Khan but a simple, innocent and honest man, who fails, gets tricked and beaten up -- but [is] never shaken from his purpose.", "What Bajrangi Bhaijaan seeks to communicate is laudable in the current climate of distrust. Wish it hadn't made such heavy weather of the well-meaning exercise.", "Bajrangi Bhaijaan is totally dependent on Salman Khan's superstardom and he pulls it off provided you overlook his in-your-face 'bhai' act in some scenes."], "rating": ["3/5", "", "4/5", "3.5/5", "", "3.5/5", "3.5/5", "", "", "3/5", "3/5", "", "2.5/5", "4/5", "2.5/5", "2.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Anna M.M.
