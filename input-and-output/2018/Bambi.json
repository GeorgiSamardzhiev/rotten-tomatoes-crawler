{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In a classic Disney animation, a fawn named Bambi joins his new friends, a young rabbit named Thumper and a skunk kit named Flower in happily exploring the woods. Bambi is captivated with a young doe named Faline, and he learns from his doting mother and his father -- the Great Prince of the Forest -- that besides the delights of the forest, there is danger in open meadows where hunters can see them. Though fear and tragedy touch Bambi's life, another spring brings renewal.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Animation/Classics/Kids & Family/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 10m", "director": "David Hand", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 23, 2017", "box_office": "$38.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Full of poignancy, excitement, and considerable satisfaction.", "Bambi (1942) is one of the most appealing, gracefully-told, lushly-beautiful, and popular Disney animated film classics. It was based on Austrian writer Felix Salten's 1923 storybook Bambi, A Life in the Woods.", "Bambi is an artistic creation of indescribable beauty. [Full Review in Spanish]", "It's a beautiful art piece with great music and enough of a plot and characters to be tolerable, even enjoyable.", "While its scarce plot may prevent it from being one of Disney's most memorable animated classics, Bambi remains an endearing and beloved film thanks to the delightful characters, the beautiful animation, and the marvelous music.", "The bogus art which has been creeping into the Disney pictures is really hammered at you in this one.", "Feels so much more like an animation experiment than it does a movie.", "It's not just Bambi's mother - I'll pause while you wipe that tear - but the film's revelation that idylls don't really exist.", "The story, while classic in nature, is a bit thin, but Bambi is a breathtaking, jaw-dropping showcase of the ingenuity and genius of Disney animators.", "Arguably Disney's greatest masterpiece, this sophisticated animation is one that continues to delight audiences of all ages", "It would be easy to be cynical about Bambi, the Walt Disney-produced film that launched a thousand anthropomorphic animal movies. But its pre-ironic simplicity has, in many ways, only improved with age. [Blu-ray]", "Even Daryl Hall would have to admit this is one of the finest animated features committed to film, produced and packaged during Walt Disney's ballsiest years of control.", "the animated film as pastoral poem, as beautiful a depiction of the natural world as one could imagine", "Animation that couldn't seem more real, even if it were made today with motion-capture dots plastered all over a baby deer.", "Vies only with Pinocchio as the most technically accomplished work of animation to come from the studio's Golden Age... the last gasp of a maturity and gravity that would immediately disappear from Disney's features.", "One of the most timeless and universal coming-of-age films ever, Bambi ranks with the very greatest of Disney's classic masterpieces.", "This animated feature based on Felix Salten's book about the coming of age of a fawn and his various forest friends (including the beloved Thumper) does convey some of the primal emotional power of Disney's features during this period.", "For the first time, Disney has done his backgrounds in oils instead of watercolors. The result is striking.", "The glow and texture of the Disney brush reach new heights, especially in the treatment of a summer thunderstorm and a raging snowstorm.", "A beautifully realised milestone in children's animation that balances outright sentiment with gentle wit, and negotiates its darker moments with skill."], "rating": ["9/10", "A+", "", "B", "3.5/5", "", "", "4/4", "9/10", "", "4/4", "A", "4/4", "9/10", "1", "A+", "", "", "", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Tim Dirks", "Elena de la Torre", "Rachel Wagner", "Jeff Beck", "Manny Farber", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Josh Larsen", "R.L.
