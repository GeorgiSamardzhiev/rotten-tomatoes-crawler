{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The mysterious Catherine Tramell (Sharon Stone), a beautiful crime novelist, becomes a suspect when she is linked to the brutal death of a rock star. Investigated by homicide detective Nick Curran (Michael Douglas), Catherine seduces him into an intense relationship.

A decade and a half later, the glimpse of his saggy naked bottom after one of the duo's sex scenes remains shocking.", "Even as Verhoeven is pushing buttons and stretching the boundaries of conventionality, he still incorporates artsy filmmaking techniques.", "...a slick, stylish, and generally unsatisfying thriller from a distressingly erratic filmmaker.", "With her high octane gyno-power at full throttle, [Sharon Stone] ... commands our attention now as much as she did on the film's initial release, defiantly holding our gaze if we dare even for a moment let our eyes drift towards anything else.", "Verhoeven tries mightily to come across as a twisted Hitchcock, but, like his leads, he's too sick and confused to succeed.", "Here is a film so utterly devoid of art and intellect that nothing remains other than a husk of ridiculous ploys.", "Joe Eszterhas shamelessly reworks ideas and themes he had earlier exploited in films such as Jagged Edge and Music Box, but the sheer overheated nature of Verhoeven's direction makes this extremely watchable.", "Flashy, raunchy and schlocky, Basic Instinct is classic nineties noir for which Verhoeven's overblown direction and Stone's exposure secured a place in movie history.", "The result may be flimsy, but it goes out and grabs you from the start.", "Trailer trash Hitchcock spliced with overboiled film noir.", "Verhoeven does not explore the dark side, but merely exploits it, and that makes all the difference in the world.", "[The film has] a smug faith in the ability of its own speed, smartness and luxe to wow the yokels.", "Slick, clever and entertainingly overheated while you're watching it, Basic Instinct starts to evaporate the second you leave the theater.", "The harsh, politically incorrect truth about Basic Instinct is that it's a tantalizing, suspensefully correct thriller.", "[Verhoeven] has always had a skill for storytelling, however questionable and tasteless the materials; but here he is hopelessly defeated by Ezsterhas' talky, slow-moving, and derivative script.", "Basic Instinct is a reminder of the difference between exhilaration and exhaustion, between tension and hysteria, between eroticism and exhibitionism. The line may be fine, but it is real enough to separate the great thrillers from the also-rans.", "Call me a prude, but it's not sexy watching an erotic thriller in which every time a couple does it, one of them gets it with an ice pick.
