Determined to make a name for himself, Stallworth bravely sets out on a dangerous mission: infiltrate and expose the Ku Klux Klan. The detective soon recruits a more seasoned colleague, Flip Zimmerman, into the undercover investigation of a lifetime. Together, they team up to take down the extremist hate group as the organization aims to sanitize its rhetoric to appeal to the mainstream.", "rating": "96", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 14m", "director": "Spike Lee", "studio": "MonkeypawProductions,40Acres&amp;AMuleFilmworks,QCEntertainment,BlumhouseProductions", "theater_date": "Aug 10, 2018", "dvd_date": "Oct 23, 2018", "box_office": "$48.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Well timed for anniversary of white nationalist march in Charlottesville where activist Heather Heyer was killed, Lee doesn't shy away from linking the past and the present this unsubtly and directly, like no other major American filmmaker.", "Devoted to the politics of race and blood, Lee is obliged to present a version of events largely existing outside actual history. Instead, we are offered history as the record of the beauty or emanation of the race.", "BlacKkKlansman may be set 40 years in the past but it's made for the America of today.", "The performances win out, negating questionable inclusions and historical inaccuracies, making this biographical account a thoroughly entertaining, triumphant venture.", "If it doesn't leave you shaking or have a pit in your stomach by the end, you're not paying attention.", "...as playful as it is deeply political...", "It's got the giddy spirit of a caper flick, one that's sometimes a little more farcical in tone than feels apt for the subject.", "Haunting, humorous, and thought provoking in equal measure.", "Spike Lee is an absolutely great filmmaker.", "The chemistry between Washington and Driver is essential to maintaining the rythm of the film persistent and entertaining in a constant shift between crime and comedy. [Full review in Spanish]", "Ten years ago, during our optimistic delusions of a post-racial America, we might have naively called such a movie over-the-top. But arriving the same week as an actual white-nationalist rally on the National Mall, it's horrifically spot-on.", "BlacKkKlansman is Spike Lee's most significant film since Do The Right Thing and Malcolm X.", "It's frighteningly timely and timeless, yes, but Lee knows how to approach it like a comedy that stands on its middle fingers. Power to the people indeed.", "Lee's joint is undoubtedly a raging inferno of all too relevant social commentary. It's a powerhouse spine-tingler which proactively manages to kick racism in the balls at brute force.", "The film's central concerns - hateful rhetoric dressed up as \"pride,\" prejudiced cops abusing their power - feel viscerally relevant.", "The great revelation of Spike Lee's BlacKkKlansman is how imagery can be used as powerful motivators, cultivating the way people feel and act.", "BlacKkKlansman is a film with a great cast, but the way director Spike Lee decided to force his message makes the movie feel heavy-handed and oddly redundant in parts.", "It makes conscience on how little humanity has evolved since the 70's. [Full review in Spanish]", "This film is a captivating, provocative, hilarious thing, with a refined aesthetic, and a police plot that illustrates, as a satire, sociopolitical parables about racial injustices.
