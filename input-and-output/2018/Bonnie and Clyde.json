{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Small-time crook Clyde Barrow (Warren Beatty) tries to steal a car and winds up with its owner's daughter, dissatisfied small-town girl Bonnie Parker (Faye Dunaway). Their crimes quickly spiral from petty theft to bank robbery, but tensions between the couple and the other members of their gang--hapless driver C.W. (Michael J. Pollard), Clyde's suave older brother Buck (Gene Hackman) and Buck's flibbertigibbet wife, Blanche (Estelle Parsons) --could destroy them all.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Arthur Penn", "studio": "WarnerBrothers", "theater_date": "Aug 13, 1967", "dvd_date": "Aug 15, 2008", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Beatty and Dunaway make one of the most memorable and sexy onscreen duos through obvious chemistry and a decidedly one-sided passion.", "It smashed American film taboos about sex and violence while demonstrating a young Warren Beatty's unique power as actor/producer...", "If it's possible for a film's ending to feel at once ambiguous and definitive, Bonnie and Clyde leaves the viewer feeling torn apart without necessarily knowing why. Its mix of lyricism, brutality, and ambivalence...", "A few years ago, Truffaut, Godard and the Nouvelle Vague stole the gangster film from America and gave it new blood. Now Penn has taken it back home where it belongs, and in so doing has found a match for his temperament.", "Naturalism -- in characters and background -- is the mark of this film in its technical perfections. Saturated in time and place, we are left with the universality of the theme and its particular contemporary relevance.", "The direction is flashy and mainly superficial, and where a little analysis and involvement wouldn't have come amiss there's only the sheer confusion of one of the most extrovert syles in Hollywood.", "Gun crazy in love.", "Faye Dunaway glides, drifts like a vertical sashay. She goes into the movie at one end, comes out the other, leaving a graceful, faint, unengaged wake behind her.", "There's a feeling, thanks to the director's consciously oblique angle of vision, both of turning over fading newspaper files for over-romantic press stories, and of watching something alive and immediate.", "With the myth, one approaches some truth about America, and even if one never quite gets there, the effort is bracing.", "I have some doubt that Bonnie and Clyde were quite the hallucinated children that Penn makes them, but in retrospective fiction they legitimately become so.", "The relationship between Clyde (Warren Beatty) and his brother (Gene Hackman) is one of the best pieces of detail work I can recall in a movie; in fact Gene Hackman's performance is an extraordinarily fine one throughout.", "'Bonnie and Clyde' moves between comedy and drama, making an energetic portrait of an America sunk in the depression, made in another vital period, in which the cinema changed to forced marches. [Full review in Spanish]", "A hybrid, an ambivalence, an alternation of achievements and collapses, an attempt to have both ways something not clearly enough seen in either.", "Destined to be among the year's most discussed, honored and profitable.", "[VIDEO ESSAY] a seamless balancing act. Equal parts true-crime expos\u00e9, dysfunctional love story, and Depression-era think piece, the picture underscores American police departments' longstanding proclivity for short cuts to justice, i.e. murder.", "After nearly a half century, the film's influence is still overwhelming and obvious.", "Bonnie and Clyde don't really know that killing kills. The film does -- unlike the run of movies about violence now, which mostly know that killing sells.", "Bonnie and Clyde is the most excitingly American American movie since The Manchurian Candidate.
