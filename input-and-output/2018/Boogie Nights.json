{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the San Fernando Valley in 1977, teenage busboy Eddie Adams (Mark Wahlberg) gets discovered by porn director Jack Horner (Burt Reynolds), who transforms him into adult-film sensation Dirk Diggler.

Reilly), Dirk fulfills all his ambitions, but a toxic combination of drugs and egotism threatens to take him back down.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 32m", "director": "Paul Thomas Anderson", "studio": "NewLineCinema,LawrenceGordonProductions", "theater_date": "Oct 10, 1997", "dvd_date": "May 19, 2016", "box_office": "$26.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A fantastic take on a Golden Era that nobody wants to remember and it's pretty relevant.

Reilly, William H. Macy, Heather Graham, and, of course, Burt Reynolds.", "The pop 1970s were typified in part by cheesy fashions, ephemeral music and a regular diet of daring, cutting-edge movies that arguably made that decade Hollywood's richest.
