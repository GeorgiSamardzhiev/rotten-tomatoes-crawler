{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In a small and religious coastal town, a simple, devoutly religious Scottish woman, Bess McNeill (Emily Watson), finds a partner in an oil rig worker from Norway, Jan Nyman (Stellan Skarsgard). However, the relationship grows strained when Nyman breaks his neck in a horrific work accident on the rig and becomes paralyzed. Unable to perform sexually and suffering mentally from the accident as well, Jan convinces Bess to have sex with other men, which she comes to believe is God's work.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 39m", "director": "Lars von Trier", "studio": "ZentropaEntertainments,LuckyRed", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$4.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Emily Watson gives this musty spiritualism a flesh and-blood sympathetic center.
