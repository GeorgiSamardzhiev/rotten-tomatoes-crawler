These are people at very different places in life.", "A lightweight but sincere glimpse at starting life when many are ending it.", "Don't hold your breath, or your heart: it's not exactly Brief Encounter. But Ardant has the moves. It's the younger cast members who must struggle to keep up.", "Ardant gives a performance you just want to bask in, glowing with desire and desirability while avoiding cougarish mother-figure clichs.", "We've seen variations on the character before. But Fanny Ardant's performance as the straitlaced wife ... is insightful and note-perfect.", "This is twinkly wish-fulfilment on stilts, presumably aimed at The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel fanclub, but it manages some funny jabs at ageism, and it's lovely to see Ardant being funny, vibrant and desirable.", "It's all a tad slight and glossy, but the performances redeem it ...", "Fitfully amusing and poignant in its insights into ageing, this cross-generational fling saga lacks the character and depth to say anything genuinely significant.", "Lead performance from Fanny Ardant is superbly measured, bringing an interesting internalization to an occasionally, but not crushingly, routine look at the power of flirtation.", "Ardant might wrestle with alienation, but Bright Days Ahead never risks alienating its self-satisfied target audience.", "\"Bright Days Ahead\" offers an interesting twist on the May-December romance.", "A French dramedy about the love affair that brings pleasure to a married 64 year old woman and a 41 year-old computer teacher.", "The well-observed script touches on a number of everyday issues about the aging process - whether you're pushing 40 or passing 60 - that add a tender and enlightening layer to this engaging, leisurely paced film.", "Moves along predictable lines but does feature a glowing, Deneuveian performance from veteran screen star Fanny Ardant.", "Struggling to get out from under the film's too-cheery surface is a much more serious movie about grown-ups confronting the depredations of old age."], "rating": ["3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "7/10", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "B", "2/4", "3/5", "3/5", "", "B-", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Edward Frost", "Geoffrey Macnab", "Jon Lyus", "David Parkinson", "Allan Hunter", "Leslie Felperin", "Ron Wilkinson", "Nigel Andrews", "Robbie Collin", "Trevor Johnston", "Siobhan Synnot", "Philip Kemp", "David Parkinson", "Brian Orndorf", "Ben Sachs", "Bill Goodykoontz", "Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat", "Gary Goldstein", "Marc Mohan", "Stephen Holden"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">HeyUGuys", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Express (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">It&#39;s Just Movies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Financial Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Scotsman", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Blu-ray.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arizona Republic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spirituality &amp; Practice", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Oregonian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times"], "date": ["March 26, 2019", "June 20, 2014", "June 20, 2014", "June 20, 2014", "June 19, 2014", "June 19, 2014", "June 19, 2014", "June 19, 2014", "June 19, 2014", "June 17, 2014", "June 16, 2014", "June 16, 2014", "June 16, 2014", "May 23, 2014", "May 8, 2014", "May 8, 2014", "May 8, 2014", "May 1, 2014", "April 30, 2014", "April 24, 2014"]}}
