{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Senator Walter Chalmers (Robert Vaughn) is aiming to take down mob boss Pete Ross (Vic Tayback) with the help of testimony from the criminal's hothead brother Johnny (Pat Renella), who is in protective custody in San Francisco under the watch of police lieutenant Frank Bullitt (Steve McQueen). When a pair of mob hitmen enter the scene, Bullitt follows their trail through a maze of complications and double-crosses.

Also mention goes to the uncreditied star of the film; San Francisco.", "Even though the story almost makes no sense and the Oscar-winning editing has several illogical cuts, Bullitt is an exquisitely satisfying motion picture, particularly if there is still an adolescent boy lodged somewhere in your psyche.", "If there is any one of his many movie roles that best exemplifies the McQueen persona, it would have to be this one."], "rating": ["", "8/10", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "", "4/4", "", "A-", "", "5/5", "5/5", "3/5", "4/5", "", "8/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Harvey G.
