{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Obsessively punctual FedEx executive Chuck Noland (Tom Hanks) is en route to an assignment in Malaysia when his plane crashes over the Pacific Ocean during a storm. The sole survivor of the flight, Chuck washes ashore on a deserted island. When his efforts to sail away and contact help fail, Chuck learns how to survive on the island, where he remains for years, accompanied by only his handmade volleyball friend, Wilson. Will Chuck ever return to civilization and reunite with his loved ones?", "rating": "89", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "2h 23m", "director": "Robert Zemeckis", "studio": "PlaytoneProductions,ImageMovers,DreamWorksSKG,TwentiethCenturyFox", "theater_date": "Dec 22, 2000", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$233.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Tom Hanks is the perfect actor for the role.", "\"Cast Away\" is an exceptionally well-crafted exploration of the survival of the human spirit. It's a movie unafraid to consider the full complexity of life.", "one-man show", "Tom Hanks' powerful, brutal and mature story.", "As melancholy as it is affirming, \"Cast Away\" tells a darkly comic, occasionally punishing parable about what happens when humans lose sight of humility in life's grand scheme - an interesting thematic twin to Tom Hanks' own \"Joe vs. the Volcano.\"", "Remains one of the more vividly transporting films I've come into contact with. It's heartbreaking, darkly comedic, bravely observational, and ultimately, pure emotional poetry.", "A gripping survival drama and one of my favorites of 2000.", "The beginning and ending of the film are a bit underdeveloped, but that's just quibbling.", "Zemeckis' tranquil control never wavers.", "I wish that all of the film's 144 minutes were spent alone with Hanks.", "This is Mr. Zemeckis' most confident directing to date. If he only had as much faith in his audience.", "Thoroughly entertaining and skillfully rendered.", "Though Hanks comes across as blandly as ever, at least his solid performance shows he's up to carrying half a movie on his own, and Zemeckis' direction is at first as busily efficient as the protagonist.", "It's really kind of ironic. The old Chuck's life is ruled by the clock. Once he's learned better, we don't get enough time with him because the author's decided it was time to go. Oh, well.", "While his philosophical ventures seem stuck in the shallow end of the pool, Zemeckis takes an important step forward as a filmmaker.", "This isn't a first time a long-awaited movie has turned out to be a crushing disappointment and it won't be the last, but the loss is made even more wrenching when one considers how little it would have taken to make Cast Away a great movie.", "It's a risky venture, and a fascinating, straightforward glimpse into the soul of a man.", "When I prayed to the film divinities that I wanted less Tom Hanks at the movies, I didn't just mean that I wanted him to be thinner.", "If all of Cast Away were as gripping as its long midsection, it would be overwhelming; still, even with its flaws, it marks another milestone performance for Tom Hanks as well as for Robert Zemeckis.", "Cast Away says what you (yes, you) would end up doing if you were on a deserted island."], "rating": ["4/5", "", "C+", "3/5", "4/4", "A", "", "4/5", "3/5", "7/10", "3/4", "", "", "2.5/5", "B", "B-", "3/4", "C", "4.5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Danielle Solzman", "Michael Kleinschrodt", "John A.
