{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Jack Moniker (Robin Williams) is a retired firefighter who teams up with reggae singer Ernest Reed (Jimmy Cliff) to open a tropical island resort. In addition to local eccentrics such as British layabout Anthony Cloyden Hayes (Peter O'Toole), Jack and Ernest are joined by tourists eager to stay at their resort, including the goofy, party-seeking duo of Barry (Eugene Levy) and Barry (Rick Moranis). Unfortunately, whiny customers and greedy land developers threaten to spoil the fun.", "rating": "11", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Harold Ramis", "studio": "WarnerBrothers/SevenArts", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 1, 2009", "box_office": "$11.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A slapdash, mostly unfunny disaster...", "This is a case where the actors are only as good as the script, which isn`t saying much. It`s not long into Club Paradise when you may feel the urge to get out.", "A frenetically unfunny and charmless movie.", "What's fresh about Ramis and Doyle-Murray's brand of comedy is that they're not one-liner wordsmiths, they're social satirists. They find humor in the subversion of a stable social community.", "The whole, crowded thing begins to resemble a low-brow Nashville.", "The unchanneled energy of Robin Williams can't redeem this messy yarn.", "Even Williams's quick-fire routines fail to raise many laughs.", "The movie is a succession of shticks -- which, when they succeed, are very funny. Unfortunately, not all of them succeed.", "Director Harold Ramis, who co-wrote the film with Brian Doyle-Murray, never stoops for an easy laugh. He seems capable, however, of making a movie with more momentum than this.", "There certainly is a lot of talent involved in Club Paradise... But most often, the level of humor is rather like that of those entertainments put on by summer campers for their own amusement.", "Club Paradise has a few good running gags, but it isn't everything that the brochures crack it up to be.", "There are enough funny skits in Club Paradise to make for a good hour of SCTV, where most of the cast is from, but too few to keep this Club Med satire afloat for 104 minutes.", "", "Despite its promise of a sunny, lightweight good time, it's a strangely angry and cynical film.", "Feels like it was inspired by a People Magazine article, and stretched out into feature length through the dubious overuse of sketch-type comedy droppings.", "A word of warning: these leftovers are rotten.", "", "Don't expect too much more from this film than a few chuckles and a soundtrack which mixes some delectable reggae and rock music.", "", ""], "rating": ["1.5/4", "", "", "3/4", "2/4", "", "2/5", "2/4", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "2/4", "2/5", "1.5/5", "2/5", "1/5", "2/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["David Nusair", "Candice Russell", "Sheila Benson", "Carrie Rickey", "Sid Smith", "David Sterritt", "John Ferguson", "", "People Staff", "Jay Boyar", "Joe Baltake", "Variety Staff", "Lori Hoffman", "Jeffrey M.
