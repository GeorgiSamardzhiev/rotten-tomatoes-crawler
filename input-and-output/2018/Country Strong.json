{"metadata": {"synopsis": "While recuperating at a rehab facility, country-music superstar Kelly Canter (Gwyneth Paltrow) takes a romantic interest in Beau Hutton (Garrett Hedlund), a talented musician who works there.

But that promise was glossed over by a film that tries too hard to be nice and not offend its target audience.", "The story is too clunky and overstuffed, and its flaws are even more glaring when spotlighted against stellar country music dramas.", "A rawer, realer, and far more believable and compelling portrait of a self-destructive country artist's attempt at recovery than CRAZY HEART.", "A little like modern country music - odd moments of sincerity, heart and authenticity peek through the plastic, the hype and the manufactured hokum.", "This canned corn falls far short of the inspiring story of triumph and tragedy it wants viewers to buy.", "Though the plot is almost formulaic, \"Country Strong\" has two things going for it: talented actors and great music", "Not exactly brimming with the essence of country music", "Some may cynically scoff at Country Strong's rollercoaster of feelings, yet it's almost completely appropriate considering the high drama present in the lyrics of country music.", "...Country Strong's downfall stems from its almost egregiously deliberate pace...", "It's got enough melodrama and full-volume diva-meltdown histrionics to blow a movie like Burlesque out of the water.", "If McGraw had been armed with a microphone, perhaps the movie could have gained something in symmetry; if Kelly had a grounding in social history, perhaps she could better be believed.", "The movie has its moments, but the characters are fuzzy around the edges...", "Paltrow is a poster girl for the virtues of yoga and a macrobiotic diet - which makes her far too healthy-looking to play the troubled, booze-sodden singer at the heart of [this] sudsy romantic melodrama.", "No saving grace here.", "Some killer tunes plus a genuinely believable turn from Glee star Paltrow make Country Strong a show worth catching.", "The good news is that Paltrow can sing; the bad news is the mawkish and one-paced drama she's playing in.", "The backstage shenanigans and tear-stained soap opera are all too predictable in Country Strong but the performances lend it conviction and the soundtrack has enough heart and soul to endear it to true country music fans.", "This is a cheesy soap opera that dearly wants to be a country and western All About Eve.
