Most importantly, Dangal scores with its first-rate performances.", "Dangal is a perfect entry point for outsiders afraid to approach Bollywood cinema.", "This film is a thundering body slam of honest emotions and sheer hard work.", "This feel-good sports drama based on true stories entertains and, more importantly, could empower young women to pursue male-dominated industries.", "The sequences are wonderfully shot and choreographed, so much so that it is difficult to believe the actors aren't full-time wrestlers. And at the centre of it all is Aamir Khan. He plays Mahavir with practiced authority and impeccable timing.", "I walked out of this film wiping away tears and feeling invincible. I felt I could wrestle down anything that hit me. How do you put a rating on that?", "Dangal is the last major film to be rolled out in 2016 and Khan has saved the best for the last for his fans.", "As a study of single-minded dedication, Nitesh Tiwari's biopic Dangal could not have had a a more apt lead... Aamir Khan is perfectly cast as Mahavir Singh Phogat.", "Within that tight-lipped mask, [Khan] finds a hundred ways to communicate emotion. That's more than you can say for Dangal, a one-trick domestic sports drama that drags on for two hours and 40 minutes.", "Let it never be said that if you've seen one inspirational sports movie, you've seen them all.", "Very solid, very sound entertainment, with thumpingly good Pritam songs that make Eye of the Tiger seem like pipsqueakery.", "This could be Aamir Khan's best performance till date. Yes, even better than Lagaan.", "The film's drama feels authentic, and not just because it's based on a true story."], "rating": ["", "", "4/5", "2.5/5", "4.5/5", "", "5/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "", "3/5", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Panos Kotzathanasis", "Anna M.M.
