Jarmusch just happens to express himself in a deadpan manner that just happens to have no appeal for me whatsoever. Of course, I only say this because he is an \"artist.\"", "[It's a] bizarre, funny, almost mystical take on the Western", "[The] metaphysical context benefits enormously from the haunting musical themes that Neil Young wrote, underlining the film's psychedelic/apocalyptic edge, and from the stunning black-and-white camera work of Robby Muller.", "Dead Man ranks as an unusual creative effort from writer/director Jarmusch (Mystery Train). But it's certainly not for everyone. I recommend it only for avid fans of Jarmusch and Depp.", "When Dead Man is imagining the Wild West as an infernal landscape of death, it is furiously alive. When it tries to reflect on those images, it begins to nod out.", "I liked the film at its original length, and I think the shortened version is Jarmusch's best movie.", "In this movie, Jarmusch displays an uncanny knack of having absolutely nothing happening on the screen for long periods of time, fading to black, and then coming back with still more nothing.", "Blake and Nobody meander through a wilderness as shrubby and nondescript as a '50s B horror movie, all to the accompaniment of an echoey Neil Young guitar score that sounds like something Wayne Campbell made up in his basement.", "Dead Man is surprisingly bland. And it becomes more dull -- and more grotesque -- as it moves along.", "Dead Man is a strange, slow, unrewarding movie that provides us with more time to think about its meaning than with meaning.", "Beautifully shot in high contrast black-and-white, Dead Man fails not because of any one particular flaw, but instead stumbles, caught in a quagmire of metaphysical constructs and Western lore.", "What was obvious in 1995-and the last quarter century has made increasingly clear-is that Dead Man, aside from merely being a quiet masterpiece, is one of the best American films of the late '90s.", "a singular piece of generic transgression, making the unmaking of the West-something that filmmakers had been doing to various degrees for decades-feel shockingly, aggressively, and poetically new."], "rating": ["", "", "9/10", "2.5/4", "", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "4/10", "C-", "2/4", "1.5/4", "2.5/5", "1", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Scout Tafoya", "David Harris", "Nathanael Hood", "James Berardinelli", "Desson Thomson", "Rita Kempley", "Todd McCarthy", "Barbara Shulgasser", "Gilbert Adair", "Edward Guthmann", "Betty Jo Tucker", "Stephen Holden", "Jack Mathews", "Robert Roten", "Owen Gleiberman", "Chris Hicks", "Roger Ebert", "Marc Savlov", "Sean Murphy", "James Kendrick"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spool", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Retro Set", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ReelViews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Francisco Examiner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Francisco Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ReelTalk Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Laramie Movie Scope", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Deseret News (Salt Lake City)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Sun-Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Austin Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">PopMatters", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Q Network Film Desk"], "date": ["January 18, 2020", "August 14, 2019", "December 29, 2018", "November 9, 2018", "November 9, 2018", "November 9, 2018", "November 9, 2018", "November 9, 2018", "November 9, 2018", "November 9, 2018", "November 9, 2018", "November 9, 2018", "November 9, 2018", "November 9, 2018", "November 9, 2018", "November 9, 2018", "November 9, 2018", "November 9, 2018", "August 1, 2018", "May 13, 2018"]}}
