On the flip side, it's bolder, bigger, and definitely pushes the boundaries.", "A vastly more derivative film.", "In the first film, Deadpool scoffed and said, \"That sounds like a f***ing franchise.\" Now, by becoming a franchise itself, Deadpool just sold out.", "I couldn't overlook the smugness that seemed to come from a certain corner of Reddit, and I couldn't give myself over to the anarchy because the anarchy felt all too calculated.", "Rather than skewering the superhero genre, it largely plays by the rules, and the result is a gripping action flick.", "Deadpool 2 works perfectly fine in giving fans what they expect coming off the success of the original.", "It always has a surprise or joke under the sleeve to make you feel like the world's happiest geek. [Full review in Spanish]", "Deadpool 2 is just as irreverent and funny and violent and over-the-top as its predecessor.", "It maintains an adequate, agile rhythm, in which comedy and action are balanced to present, sometimes, ephemeral scenes that seek to portray a more personal chronicle of Deadpool, but that, equally, end up being satirized. [Full review in Spanish]", "For those who see every superhero film but fatigue has not set in, the Deadpool movies are exactly what you need to keep things fresh and different, unafraid to make fun of the very universe it occupies.", "Suffice it to say if you liked Deadpool, Deadpool 2 will likely be the funniest film you see all summer.", "'Deadpool 2' repeats the same meta-joke as the first 'Deadpool,' but, thankfully, the joke is still funny.", "But ultimately I found it frustrating: not quite the film it could and should have been, and too willing to punch down where punching up would serve it better.", "Deadpool 2 is so full of superhero movie in-jokes, one suspects it will be almost incomprehensible in a few years. But for now, this is the franchise we need to deflate all the franchises we probably don't.", "There are gleefully over-the-top fight sequences (often hyperviolent to suit the R rating), too many pop culture references to count, colourful and lovable characters and quips that come at you every second.", "Deadpool 2 is similar but superior to its predecessor.
