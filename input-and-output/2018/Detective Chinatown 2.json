Detective Chinatown 2 is a boisterous sequel to the 2015 Bangkok-set hit.", "What better way to celebrate Chinese new year than with this film? Erm ... actually, there are a number of activities that might be better.", "Here's hoping the third outing, which will take the main characters to Tokyo, returns to the amiable, artful high jinks of the first.", "The script blasts through reams of plot with lightning dialogue, and even if you have a fast eye for subtitles you may come to the end of the movie with no clear idea what happened.", "Michael Pitt also makes a special guest cameo appearance, except his line delivery is so forced and awkward it feels as if he doesn't even want to be there, and truthfully, I can't blame him", "Sicheng dials the original's lewd humor down a notch, but still mines stereotypes for easy laughs with Wang delivering his trademark high pitch comedic star turn.", "It isn't remotely subtle."], "rating": ["B", "", "2/5", "", "3/5", "2.5/4", "3/5", "2/5", "2/4", "2/4", "2/5", "", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Adam Graham", "Alex Lines", "James Marsh", "Maggie Lee", "Simran Hans", "Nick Allen", "Allan Hunter", "Peter Bradshaw", "Michael Phillips", "Mick LaSalle", "Robert Kojder", "John Berra", "Geoffrey Macnab"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Detroit News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Inquiry", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South China Morning Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Observer (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">RogerEbert.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Express (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">San Francisco Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flickering Myth", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)"], "date": ["May 4, 2018", "March 15, 2018", "March 15, 2018", "March 8, 2018", "February 19, 2018", "February 16, 2018", "February 16, 2018", "February 16, 2018", "February 15, 2018", "February 15, 2018", "February 15, 2018", "February 14, 2018", "February 14, 2018"]}}
