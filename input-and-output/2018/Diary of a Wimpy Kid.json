{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Middle school is not an enjoyable experience for preteen Greg Heffley (Zachary Gordon) but a horrid ordeal of social land-mines that he must bear. To do so, he devises schemes to win him the recognition and status he feels he deserves -- all of which fail miserably. Greg chronicles his misadventures, thoughts and opinions in a diary to prepare for the day that he will no longer have to put up with nonsense.", "rating": "54", "genre": "Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 32m", "director": "Thor Freudenthal", "studio": "ColorForce", "theater_date": "Mar 19, 2010", "dvd_date": "Nov 25, 2015", "box_office": "$64.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The movie is funny, endearing, and true enough to the life-is-pain spirit of the books.", "Diary of a Wimpy Kid is a wonderful family film that will generate meaningful discussions between parents and kids.", "An imaginative family film featuring a tremendously mischievous and likable lead character.", "...a bottom-of-the-barrel children's movie...", "If you're a parent who's been forced to sit through a barren desert of painfully unfunny family comedies, Diary will feel like an oasis.", "", "Zachary Gordon, as the wimpy kid of the title, seems to be aiming for a Ferris Buehler-esque omniscience and superiority and, while he doesn't quite pull it off all the way, I was down for his struggle.", "A very forgettable and easily missed comedy...", "The characters (through no fault of the young performers) have all the personality of hand puppets.", "Conveys, in a good-humoured, sharply observed way, the small, painful cruelties and unpredictable rules of early adolescence, and it celebrates awkwardness without feeling the need to convert it into cheap triumph.", "The film retains much of the original humour, some of it well executed. It's reasonably faithful to the spirit of the books, probably because Kinney is the executive producer, but it's by no means equal to his originals.", "Perceptive, funny, unusually edgy voyage into the comic travails of schoolyard politics and childhood friendship.", "Performances from the young cast are arguably a little too slick and knowing for the naive characters they are playing, but that is often par for the course in American films these days.", "In an early self-referential monologue, Greg says, \"Who wants to see a movie about a kid who's stuck in middle school with a bunch of morons?\" Who indeed?", "All right all you 8 - 12 year olds, get in line for some fun at Greg Heffley's expense.", "While the blackness of many situations resonates and despite some amusing moments, the film's tone is so ardent and realistic, it often works against it. Nonetheless, this coming of age film for the under 12 set has merit and charm", "[A] sappy and superficial adaptation...", "The film's wry wit and understanding of childhood anxieties will remind older viewers of the television series The Wonder Years which is no small compliment.", "Though the film sags a little in places, it imparts its be-true-to-yourself life lessons with sweetness and charm...", "As my son says, 'The books were a lot better.'"], "rating": ["", "3/4", "3.5/5", "1/4", "", "1/5", "3/5", "", "2/5", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "2.5/5", "", "", "", "2/5", "3/5", "3/5", "6/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Felicia Feaster", "Sarah Knight Adamson", "John Hanlon", "David Nusair", "John Gholson", "Derek Adams", "Dave White", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Peter Galvin", "Philippa Hawker", "Paul Byrnes", "Jim Schembri", "Leigh Paatsch", "Mark Demetrius", "Andrew L.
