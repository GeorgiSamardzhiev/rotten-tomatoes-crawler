{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Con artist Lawrence Jamieson (Michael Caine) is a longtime resident of a luxurious coastal resort, where he enjoys the fruits of his deceptions -- that is, until a competitor, Freddy Benson (Steve Martin), shows up. When the new guy's lowbrow tactics impinge on his own work, Jamieson resolves to get rid of him. Confident of his own duplicitous talents, Jamieson challenges Benson to a winner-takes-all competition: whoever swindles their latest mark first can stay, while the other must leave town.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 50m", "director": "Frank Oz", "studio": "OrionPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 20, 2015", "box_office": "$40.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["All these years later Dirty Rotten Scoundrels is still a practically perfect comedy, brimming from scene to scene with outrageous behavior amidst the gorgeous scenery of the French Riviera.", "Bright performances define this film as much as the big belly laughs.", "...a deliberately-paced yet consistently entertaining comedy that benefits substantially from Caine and Martin's superb work...", "The writers, Stanley Shapiro and Paul Henning, have brightened up their 1964 script in collaboration with Dale Launer with some caustic new gags and a more effective ending; and Frank Oz's direction keeps the comedy zapping along at a fine pace.", "Wit and culture and measured restraint take on unabashed brazenness and bullheaded improvisation in a crazy cartoon of the flimflam Olympics...", "Martin and Caine scam women.
