It's truly beautiful.", "With a style that never separates from coming-of-age comedy, Burnham captures the concerns of postmillennial adolescence and what it means to be a teenager. [Full review in Spanish]", "A coming of age. A slice of life. The rites of passage. Though any of these tags could be applied here, none of them completely fit. For this exquisitely poignant portrait of a solitary teenage girl is quite unlike anything we have seen before.", "This is a kind, loving film that will warm your heart to no end.", "Not since Welcome to the Dollhouse (1995) has a comedy captured so vividly the agony and the ecstasy-well, OK, it's all agony-of being a... teenage girl. [Full review in Spanish]", "Like a lot of teenagers, EIGHTH GRADE is funny, awkward, and ambitious - it is a film that represents an accomplished graduation for both Bo Burnham and Elsie Fisher.", "Such honesty in presenting a teenage girl makes writer/director Bo Burnham's movie a superior coming-of-age story.", "Eighth Grade reminds us that teenage girls and Kayla's story are valid, and we should all listen a little more closely.", "The film shows the disturbing disconnect between online confidence and in-person self-consciousness.", "It's hard to be middle school age where you are betwixt and between. [Bo Burnham] Burnham successfully displays the challenge it presents for kids and for parents. And he does it with a lot of humor and empathy.", "Burnham's biggest gift here as a storyteller is his compassion and refusal to pretend the differences between today's kids and the rest of us is anything other than trivial."], "rating": ["", "7/10", "", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "6/10", "", "5/5", "7/10", "4.5/5", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "3.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Sarah Brinks", "Mike Massie", "Dan Buffa", "Paul McGuire Grimes", "Dennis Harvey", "Matthew St. Clair", "Jason Fraley", "David &#39;Mad Dog&#39; Bradley", "Katie Duggan", "Matt Cipolla", "Yasser Medina", "Leigh Paatsch", "Dan Scully", "J.
