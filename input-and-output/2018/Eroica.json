{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This Polish film, divided into two segments, examines what it means to be a hero. Set during World War II, the first segment follows a man forced to become a soldier during the Warsaw Uprising. As the man continues to drink and resist fighting, his choice seems less the cowardly option than the sane one. In the second segment, a soldier tries to escape from a POW camp. While it is unclear whether or not he succeeded, the attempt unnerves the guards and inspires the other prisoners.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 27m", "director": "Andrzej Munk", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's the work of a deep thinker sardonically reflecting on the insanity of war and the human condition."], "rating": ["A"], "fresh": ["fresh"], "critic": ["Dennis Schwartz"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews"], "date": ["January 19, 2006"]}}
