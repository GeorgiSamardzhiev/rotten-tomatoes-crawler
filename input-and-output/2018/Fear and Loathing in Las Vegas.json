{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Raoul Duke (Johnny Depp) and his attorney Dr. Gonzo (Benicio Del Toro) drive a red convertible across the Mojave desert to Las Vegas with a suitcase full of drugs to cover a motorcycle race. As their consumption of drugs increases at an alarming rate, the stoned duo trash their hotel room and fear legal repercussions. Duke begins to drive back to L.A., but after an odd run-in with a cop (Gary Busey), he returns to Sin City and continues his wild drug binge.", "rating": "49", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 59m", "director": "Terry Gilliam", "studio": "RhinoFilms", "theater_date": "May 22, 1998", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$10.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["All you will learn is that the irksome excesses of early 1970s living were left behind for a very good reason. They just weren't that much fun at all.", "The flaccid film is a goon-show version of Thompson's commentary on the craziness of the American Dream.", "The one stand-out is Johnny Depp, who brings Hunter S Thompson to bald-headed, pigeon-toed life.", "Unless viewed through the prism of psychedelic habituates, it is unlikely audiences will find much to savour in Gilliam's picture.", "One of Terry Gilliam's worst films (almost unwatchable)", "A peculiar and oddly haunting achievement.", "It's certainly distinctive, looking at times like Richard Lester put through a postmodernist blender.", "Bizarre, unpredictable yet strangely alluring.", "The film is intensely pretentious, far too clever for its own good.", "It's larger-than life, wild, dizzy, colourful and vulgar, and goes round in circles - for a very long time.", "The fear is comical; the loathing almost nonexistent.", "(Gilliam's) vision is too reflexively comic to evoke the shadows of dread in Thompson's writing.", "Certainly uneven at times, but Terry Gilliam's surreal mood piece paints a vivid, splashy picture of gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson.", "A beautiful cinematic showcase for Thompson at the peak of his writing skills.", "It may start off as a lighthearted, excess-filled, party-road-trip movie, but Depp is reigned in a little towards the end as his character (a stand-in for Thompson) poetically bemoans the sad failure of the late-60s ideals and values.", "More headache than head trip.", "Pic serves up a sensory overload without any compensatory reflection on the outlandish and irresponsible behavior on view.", "This is the best acid-inspired movie since Roger Corman's The Trip - and it is a darn sight more accurate in its depiction [of] the highs and the lows, the terrible confusion alternating with lucidity, the excitement that gives way to paranoia.", "...he first hour of the film is as successful as anything I've ever seen or read at conveying how the world looks to the drugged.", "Years from now, it will be reappraised as a misunderstood masterpiece.
