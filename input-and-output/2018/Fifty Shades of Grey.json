{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When college senior Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson) steps in for her sick roommate to interview prominent businessman Christian Grey (Jamie Dornan) for their campus paper, little does she realize the path her life will take. Christian, as enigmatic as he is rich and powerful, finds himself strangely drawn to Ana, and she to him. Though sexually inexperienced, Ana plunges headlong into an affair -- and learns that Christian's true sexual proclivities push the boundaries of pain and pleasure.", "rating": "24", "genre": "Romance", "runtime": "2h 5m", "director": "Sam Taylor-Johnson", "studio": "MichaelDeLuca", "theater_date": "Feb 13, 2015", "dvd_date": "Jan 5, 2016", "box_office": "$166.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Feels like an elegantly made - the cinematography and score are top notch - night time soap opera.", "At least, the film goes out of the way to show the use of condoms.", "If this is love, no thanks.", "In terms of story and character, this film is in desperate need of a safe word.", "Overlong, too clinical in design, and based on lowest common denominator entertainment (or so I'm told), Fifty Shades of Grey still manages to be engaging, funny, and unexpectedly human.", "Given that this is her second film, [Sam] Taylor-Johnson directs the film with taste and care by focusing on the interactions between Ana and Christian rather than the sexual side of the story and the film looks stunning.", "Fifty Shades of Grey will draw you in out of curiosity and possibly hopes of a good movie, then leave you wondering why you agreed to such a thing in the first place, much like the main character.", "Funny that no one seemed to understand in the making of Grey that watching two vaguely defined characters engage in ceaseless rounds of conservatively filmed grimaces and stifled moans gets tiresome quickly.", "There is little more critical than to say a third of the film had people laughing at dialogue, and the other two thirds wiggling in their seats, not from discomfort or innervation, but from boredom.", "You've seen worse; you've imagined better.", "Nice as it looks, this movie tastes bad...", "Most of the actual sex has less erotic value than what can be found on late night HBO, and it certainly doesn't hold a candle to the graphic content of the novels or the erotic-charged hype surrounding the film.", "You would've put the book down after reading the character's name on the third page: Anastasia Steele? Puh-lease!", "[General audiences] might need to be handcuffed to their seats and wonder how something so wildly popular could be so stiflingly unerotic.", "Every fiber of my being is screaming at her to send this man packing.", "The dialogue is terrible and Dornan's Grey is so humourless that any vaguely funny lines fall utterly flat. On the plus side Johnson does her best with what she's been given, Ana is a Thomas Hardy fan, and Grey has a nice kitchen.", "If the book was aimed at women, the movie appears to be aimed at the boyfriends and husbands they will drag to the cinema, who are rewarded for their patience at sitting through the creepy pseudo-romance with ample shots of Johnson's bosoms.", "The entire palate of the film was cool and gray, which doesn't do much to incite passion. and I don't think we should blame the actors.", "Fifty Shades of Grey is that hot date you bring home to discover (s)he's a cold fish between the sheets.", "This is worth going to the cinema for, leave your expectations behind and relax and enjoy a visually beautiful film."], "rating": ["2/5", "2/10", "1.5/4", "D", "", "3/5", "3.9/10", "1/5", "1/5", "2/5", "", "D+", "5/10", "1/5", "", "1.5/5", "2/5", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "Dan Scully", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Brandon Davis", "Nicholas Bell", "Leslie Combemale", "David Brake", "Helen Razer", "Beth McDonough", "Julie Crawford", "Ed Frankl", "Amanda Greever", "Sarah Cartland", "Alistair Ryder", "Lisa Johnson Mandell", "Rub\u00e9n Rosario", "Rosalynn Try-Hane"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema76", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Musings of Guitargalchina", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ComicBook.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Daily Review/Crikey", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Babbling Blonde", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">North Shore News (Vancouver, B.C.)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Daily Times (Tennessee)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Caution Spoilers", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemole", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AtHomeInHollywood.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MiamiArtZine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Battle Royale With Cheese"], "date": ["February 2, 2021", "December 4, 2020", "September 7, 2020", "July 16, 2020", "April 10, 2020", "November 26, 2019", "November 12, 2019", "September 19, 2019", "August 2, 2019", "May 17, 2019", "May 16, 2019", "May 10, 2019", "April 17, 2019", "April 4, 2019", "February 5, 2019", "November 10, 2018", "October 25, 2018", "August 22, 2018", "August 22, 2018", "August 21, 2018"]}}
