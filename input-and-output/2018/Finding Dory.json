{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) is a wide-eyed, blue tang fish who suffers from memory loss every 10 seconds or so. The one thing she can remember is that she somehow became separated from her parents as a child. With help from her friends Nemo and Marlin, Dory embarks on an epic adventure to find them. Her journey brings her to the Marine Life Institute, a conservatory that houses diverse ocean species. Dory now knows that her family reunion will only happen if she can save mom and dad from captivity.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Animation", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Andrew Stanton", "studio": "PixarAnimationStudios,WaltDisneyPictures", "theater_date": "Jun 17, 2016", "dvd_date": "Oct 25, 2016", "box_office": "$486.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["For a film set in the ocean, it somehow even manages to throw in a car chase sequence.", "Filled to the brim with entertaining action sequences, slapstick humor, and the infinite heart and honesty that we have come to expect from Pixar's best films.", "It's adorable and hilarious... but I wish it had taken more of a stand on things.", "It was not a bad sequel, which is nice.", "And if you haven't fallen in love with the most forgetful fish in the ocean, you will now.", "The Pixar animation masters have created another visual feast, with images and effects not even contemplated in 2003. Had Finding Dory come from any other group of artists, perhaps I would have judged it a success. But Pixar I hold to a higher standard.", "While it lacks the tight narrative structure of Pixar's most ambitious efforts, it is a beautiful, charming and funny film.", "Swimmingly sensational!", "Funnier than the original... The movie takes an odd over-the-top turn in its final minutes that feels like it would have been better suited in an animated Disney TV series.", "Even though we didn't find it necessary to break out the hankies for this one there are lots of laughs, particularly in the first half of the film.", "The dip back into the flow of some of Pixar's best work building a world has its rewards.", "Nourishing in ways I could never have imagined, Finding Dory is a simple storytelling delight...", "Pleasant, endearing and possessed of enough charm to make you overlook its lack of originality, the film is about as much as you could hope for from such a calculated follow-up. Sadly and honestly, even now, I don't know if that's a compliment.", "Efforts like Finding Dory do little to quell the feeling that a certain measure of rubber-stamp efficiency has gripped the studio (the superb Inside Out excepted). In other words, welcome to Pixar's cash-grab years.", "What Finding Dory does is take the Pixar formula and deliver exactly what you want to see from a Pixar movie.", "Finding Dory is stunningly beautiful.", "Disability - or really, any kind of minor impairment - is rarely featured in mainstream cinema, and Finding Dory is at its strongest when exploring these uncharted waters.", "It's a typically excellent offering from the studio, filled with big laughs and bigger feelings.", "Finding Dory is a sweet tale that will have audiences cheering our blue friend on as she \"just keeps swimming.\"", "While it may not deliver the freshness of Finding Nemo, it is still overflowing with warmth, laughs, and genuine charm."], "rating": ["1", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "", "8/10", "", "B", "", "B+", "5/5", "B", "2.5/4", "", "A-", "4/5", "5/5", "", "3.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Avaryl Halley", "Andrew Galdi", "Christie Cronan", "Chris McCoy", "Sean Collier", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Kirsten Acuna", "Linda and Al Lerner", "Leslie Combemale", "Kate Rodger", "Ryan Syrek", "Matt Brunson", "Dan Murrell", "Rachel Wagner", "Tom Bond", "Allen Adams", "Amanda Greever", "Doug Jamieson"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Raising Whasians", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Box Office Prophets", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Insider", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies and Shakers", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newshub (NZ)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Reader (Omaha, NE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Frenzy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen Junkies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Maine Edge", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Daily Times (Tennessee)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Jam Report"], "date": ["December 4, 2020", "September 7, 2020", "May 4, 2020", "May 4, 2020", "February 4, 2020", "January 14, 2020", "December 16, 2019", "November 3, 2019", "October 27, 2019", "October 21, 2019", "October 21, 2019", "August 26, 2019", "July 9, 2019", "June 20, 2019", "April 19, 2019", "April 12, 2019", "March 29, 2019", "February 19, 2019", "February 2, 2019", "January 30, 2019"]}}
