{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Marlin (Albert Brooks), a clown fish, is overly cautious with his son, Nemo (Alexander Gould), who has a foreshortened fin. When Nemo swims too close to the surface to prove himself, he is caught by a diver, and horrified Marlin must set out to find him. A blue reef fish named Dory (Ellen DeGeneres) -- who has a really short memory -- joins Marlin and complicates the encounters with sharks, jellyfish, and a host of ocean dangers. Meanwhile, Nemo plots his escape from a dentist's fish tank.", "rating": "99", "genre": "Animation/Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Andrew Stanton", "studio": "PixarAnimationStudios", "theater_date": "May 30, 2003", "dvd_date": "Nov 22, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The visuals are as sharp as the scripting, succeeding with laughs, thrills, heartache, and unforgettable characterizations to craft an animated masterpiece.", "Compared to other Pixar films, this may not be as good as the Toy Story franchise, but it's awfully close.", "A family film that is truly for the whole family - from grandpop to grandson.
