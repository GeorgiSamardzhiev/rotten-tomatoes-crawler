{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Hoping to reach the moon by the end of the decade, NASA plans a series of extremely dangerous, unprecedented missions in the early 1960s. Engineer Neil Armstrong joins the space program, spending years in training and risking his life during test flights. On July 16, 1969, the nation and world watch in wonder as Armstrong and fellow astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Michael Collins embark on the historic Apollo 11 spaceflight.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 21m", "director": "Damien Chazelle", "studio": "TempleHillEntertainment", "theater_date": "Oct 12, 2018", "dvd_date": "Jan 8, 2019", "box_office": "$44.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["When we finally get to the moon, any of my problems with the film melted away.", "The exhaustive reconstructions of rockets and shuttles and NASA facilities are tremendous, exposing the claustrophobic interiors and the startlingly limited visibility.", "Loved the use of real audio, footage, and commercials from the time period.", "This is Chazelle's best film to date...", "Damien Chazelle does it again. With brush strokes of Kubrick, tension, suspense and intrigue are dealt enviably in this movie. [Full review in Spanish]", "Chazelle has done it again, delivering one of the finest space films ever made by focusing on the everyday humanism of our reluctant heroes rather than flag-waving cliches, thus cementing his place on the forefront of the next frontier of cinema.", "Combining breathtaking, claustrophobic cabin sequences that feel like you're being shot into space in a shoebox, with Ryan Gosling's restrained-but-pained performance as Neil Armstrong, a grieving father focused on the mission, it's a powerhouse.", "An undeniably solid and occasionally spectacular big screen depiction of an achievement that still has the power to grip the world 50 years after it happened.", "First Man, although concerned with a world-historic, world-changing event, has a limited goal and framework...", "Trends downwards from its thrilling opening sequence.", "A sobering study of grief and obsession delivered with a stunning eye of respect for Armstrong. Chazelle launches his excellence in filmmaking into the cosmos.", "First Man captures that longing for safety quite well, treating it as a myth that's essentially supernatural in its elusiveness.", "The delayed gratification makes the ending all the more thrilling.", "I have no idea what compels a person to get inside of a tiny metal compartment and get blasted off into the sky ... But oh, Chazelle and his team do an incredible job of giving us a hint of what that rush must feel like.", "A great film about loneliness, mourning and the human ability of achieving incredible things. [Full review in Spanish]", "One of the most compelling and inherently dramatic works of the year.", "A film that doesn't glorify Neil Armstrong as a national hero, but rather opts to illustrate the determination of a hermetic and introspective person who silently mourns the mourning caused by a family impairment. [Full review in Spanish]", "This Neil Armstrong biopic excels at the kinetic launches and spaceflight sequences, but drags along when it has both feet on the ground.", "[Chazelle] offers a fresh perspective on Neil Armstrong's life at work, detailing his journey as an astronaut on a mission mostly shot either from an intimate or first-person point-of-view.", "Damien Chazelle is an enthusiastic, visually expressive filmmaker with practically nothing of interest to say about the human experience."], "rating": ["", "8/10", "4/5", "", "9/10", "4/4", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "4/5", "8/10", "A-", "", "", "8/10", "", "5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Fletcher Powell", "Mike Massie", "Paul McGuire Grimes", "Dennis Harvey", "Victor Pineyro", "Jason Fraley", "Stephen A.
