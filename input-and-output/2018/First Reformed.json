The ending goes haywire in the most beautiful way and I really loved it.", "I've rarely seen it presented with as much brilliant, questioning depth as in Paul Schrader's First Reformed.", "First Reformed's three outstanding central performances (Hawke, Seyfried, Kyles) are complimented by three incisive and crucial supporting turns...", "The pacing could have been tighter, but the slow-burn vibe, the darkening tone, Hawke's mesmerizing deterioration, and the shocking finale are quite absorbing.", "Noticeable effort for each frame to tell its own story. There are very perceptible shades of \"Taxi Driver\" in \"First Reformed\". [Full review in Spanish]", "The film challenges present-day evangelicals to become environmentalists, two sides of the political spectrum that often clash but should really be on the same team.", "It all comes together to form an experience in which the visuals and ethics are equally grey while amorality reigns supreme.", "[It] may not succeed on all fronts, ... but it works its magic where it counts: It's a textbook case, literally, of Schrader's concept of transcendental style.", "To watch First Reformed is to stare unsparingly into the most basic, unanswerable philosophical questions we have. It is, as Toller says, both exhilarating and exhausting.", "\"First Reformed\" is not only a rich and detailed character study, but it also serves as a timely and scathing critique of politics, the church, and society's middle finger to the environment.", "It makes astute observations about the state of religion generally in our secular age, as well as the toxic temptations facing Christians particularly.", "This is an emotionally charged work of art that ought to spark debate on religion, big business, suicide and the environment to name just a few.", "Like the best of Schrader's work, First Reformed will burrow under your skin, changing shape as you look at it in different lights.", "Were this to be Schrader's final film, it'd be a fitting coda to his filmography, but the life on display implies he's just getting his second wind.", "It manages to turn on a light in the middle of so much darkness, such as the cinematic miracle that the film is. [Full Review in Spanish]", "When I paint my masterpiece.", "A career best performance from Hawke is propelled by a sterling examination of faith and desire. This is Schrader's best work is years.", "A raw, ragged, angry work, born out a deep sense of exasperation and hopelessness in the face of rampant indifference to a world in pain.", "The whole film is like watching a pot of water on the stove. The lid is on and the flame is getting hotter and hotter; we're left wondering when the top will come bursting off.", "At the end, it makes a turn for the supernatural with a final shot that benefits from equivocation that makes it alarming and arresting."], "rating": ["", "4/5", "", "6/10", "8/10", "3.5/4", "4.5/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "4.5/5", "", "5/5", "3.5/4", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Dustin Chang", "Ian Simmons", "David Bax", "Mike Massie", "Victor Pineyro", "Jason Fraley", "Matt Cipolla", "CJ Sheu", "Chris McCoy", "Jeff York", "Brett McCracken", "Linda and Al Lerner", "Oscar Goff", "Dominic Griffin", "V\u00edctor L\u00f3pez G.", "Michael J.
