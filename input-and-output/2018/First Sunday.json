{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Petty thieves Durell (Ice Cube) and LeeJohn (Tracy Morgan) face a big problem: The two must come up with $17,000 in one week, or Durell will no longer be able to see his son. The goofy scoundrels embark on a haphazard plan to rob the neighborhood church, but they find the mission trickier than expected. When they arrive, they discover that somebody equally disreputable has already had his hand in the coffers. Now, they must trace the money to a group of parishioners.", "rating": "12", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "David E.

Awful stuff!", "If it was not for Morgan's goofy character or Katt Williams, I would be giving this movie a zero.", "Devilish satire outing felons who come in gaudy three piece suits too, a sweltering church 'hotter than Satan's toenails' and Sunday sermon sidebars that all the rest makes go down easy.", "The missing-church-funds subplot will be easily figured out by any four year old, but it winds up being a McGuffin anyway.", "With his movie debut, Talbert plays to his established audience, the redemption message riding roughshod over everything, even such trifling concerns as character consistency and continuity.", "Tired, unfunny comedy with Ice Cube as a bungling crook.", "The least funny man ever to make a career in comedy movies, Ice Cube hauls his sullen mug back in front of the cameras for the execrable First Sunday.", "Cube's maudlin, overly precious relationship with his son hits a few sour notes, but Morgan's rubbery, half-crazy Leejohn always drags the film back into its manic, cartoony groove.", "On your own day of judgement, select a better film from the listings.", "Loretta Devine and Olivia Cole shine out as veteran members of the flock, but even their class combined is no saving grace.", "Seasoned stars such as Loretta Devine and Regina Hall do their best...but it's an uphill struggle with a script even the good lord would rent asunder.", "Grafting moral uplift on to a slapstick caper with mixed results, this nevertheless captures some of the giddy eccentricity of the Ealing comedies it haphazardly resembles.", "With its unlikely but sweet-natured story, 'First Sunday' is a cut above most of the \"January junk\" that floods the theaters this time of year.", "Getting religion in the end is no excuse for a parade of bad taste.", "Ice Cube is now Public Enemy Number Fun, although First Sunday is only fun if you're in dire need of a modernist urban take on the strain of comedy Abbott and Costello used to practice, which, let's be honest, wasn't that funny to begin with.", "Talbert's unable to pin down exactly what kind of movie he wants to make, a slapstick sermon or an urban tragicomedy?"], "rating": ["2.5/4", "2/5", "5/10", "4", "", "1/5", "", "2/5", "1/5", "1/5", "1/5", "3/5", "2/5", "2/5", "", "2/6", "2.5/4", "1/4", "1/4", "C"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Dave White", "Joshua Starnes", "Jamie Gillies", "Austin Kennedy", "Kevin McCarthy", "Prairie Miller", "Alonso Duralde", "Phelim O&#39;Neill", "", "Wendy Ide", "Ken McIntyre", "Simon Jordan", "Stella Papamichael", "Tim Evans", "Mark Holcomb", "Linda Cook", "Jeffrey Westhoff", "Marc Savlov", "Amy Nicholson"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ComingSoon.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Apollo Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sin Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">BDK Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">NewsBlaze", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MSNBC", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Sun (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">BBC.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sky Cinema", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Quad City Times (Davenport, IA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Northwest Herald (Crystal Lake, IL)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Austin Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">I.E.
