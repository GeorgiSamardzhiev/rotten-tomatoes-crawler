But when we finally do, those 15 minutes or so of footage are as phenomenal as anything you'll see this year...", "The documentary feels more like a gripping piece of television than a fully fleshed out feature-film narrative. ... Either way, the athletic feat is undeniably impressive and the footage is inherently breathtaking.", "Free Solo ... is a vertiginous puzzle both visually and conceptually.", "In the end, it feels like a privilege to be a part of his process and experience even a fraction of his journey... from the relative comfort and safety of our seat.", "About passion and obsession, dealing with fear and striving for grandeur, pushing the boundaries of what's possible.", "What type of risks make life worthwhile? And how many times can you say \"Oh my god oh my god oh my god\" to yourself while watching a movie?", "This awe-inspiring National Geographic documentary is as much a celebration of U.S. parks and wilderness as it is a record of one of the most audacious feats in the history of mountaineering.", "Free Solo is a breathtaking film that not only delves into Alex's motivations, but the feelings of the people around him.", "The film ends with an incredibly captured climbing sequence that is rooted in character.", "Hannold's ultimately selfish act of recklessness is given a hagiographic treatment that feels both irresponsible and emotionally dishonest.", "Free Solo's value relies basically on its technical difficulties, but without obstacles, fear or doubts, the narrative ends up in need of strength. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Free Solo is a thrillingly entertaining film, filled with unexpected set-backs and triumphs, as well as an appealing personal portrait of a rare and supremely gifted human being.", "Please go see Free Solo on the biggest screen possible, those of you who've climbed the Lions and the Chief, and yes, those of you who rarely leave the couch.", "There were times during the film that I feared I was watching something like Werner Herzog's pathbreaking Grizzly Man. But Free Solo has none of that film's nihilism, although Alex Honnold in many ways is a Herzogian hero.", "Expect stunning visuals, plenty of drama.", "You get to experience all of the dangers inching up the granite wall without ropes...This is a revealing biography of what makes this free soloist climber tick.", "Like Alex Honnold himself, Free Solo is straightforward, honest, humble and confident, with a grip of steel.", "There's a lot of depth to the film. It's more than just a man taking on the impossible. We get inside Honnold's headspace, which, in turn, causes us to rethink our approach to our own obstacles in life.", "Honnold's journey elicits audience-wide gasps, mixed in with an \"Oh, my God\" or two."], "rating": ["A-", "", "3/4", "", "", "A", "A-", "", "4/5", "3.5/5", "2/4", "", "4/5", "9/10", "5/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "4.5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jeffrey Zhang", "Dennis Harvey", "Jason Fraley", "CJ Sheu", "Steven Prokopy", "Brent McKnight", "Matt Pais", "Andrea Gronvall", "Grethe Kemp", "Karl Delossantos", "Matthew Lucas", "Fausto Ponce", "Cate Marquis", "Julie Crawford", "Rohan Naahar", "Rashid Irani", "Linda and Al Lerner", "CJ Johnson", "Preston Barta", "Diane Pershing"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Strange Harbors", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">48 Hills", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WTOP (Washington, D.C.)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Review Film Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Third Coast Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MattPais.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">City Press (South Africa)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Smash Cut Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">From the Front Row", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Proceso", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">We Are Movie Geeks", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">North Shore News (Vancouver, B.C.)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hindustan Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hindustan Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies and Shakers", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Mafia", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Denton Record-Chronicle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Malibu Times"], "date": ["January 29, 2021", "October 21, 2020", "July 24, 2020", "July 1, 2020", "July 1, 2020", "June 30, 2020", "June 19, 2020", "March 3, 2020", "January 3, 2020", "August 2, 2019", "June 3, 2019", "May 28, 2019", "April 19, 2019", "April 15, 2019", "April 12, 2019", "April 11, 2019", "April 5, 2019", "April 3, 2019", "March 30, 2019", "March 12, 2019"]}}
