{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This acclaimed biographical drama presents major events in the life of Mohandas Gandhi (Ben Kingsley), the beloved Indian leader who stood against British rule over his country. Dedicated to the concept of nonviolent resistance, Gandhi is initially dismissed by English officials, including the influential Lord Irwin (John Gielgud), but eventually he and his cause become internationally renowned, and his gatherings of passive protest move India towards independence.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "3h 8m", "director": "Richard Attenborough", "studio": "InternationalFilmInvestors,CarolinaBank,Indo-British,GoldcrestFilmsInternational", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 7, 2013", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["\"Gandhi\" underlines the importance of nonviolent demonstration, especially in 2020 when America has been infiltrated by communist influences turning America's masses into \"useful idiots\" by encouraging terrorism as the means to express desire for change.", "Kingsley's performance is central to the film's triumph - perhaps surpassing the rest of the technical and artistic values.", "The film is triumphantly not a deification, but it is necessarily a simplification, and suffers from some of those disadvantages... But the embattled spirit of respect for human dignity and the need for mutual tolerance flow clearly through the film.", "This is a film that provokes healthy doubt even as it pays stirring obeisance to sainthood.", "As a whole, Gandhi is never less than intelligent in dealing with the events and facts with which it chooses to deal, and there is never a boring moment.", "Although he may look like the real thing, Ben Kingsley begins to sound like a computer reading fortune cookies.", "Few people will leave the theater unaffected, or unchanged.", "Although Gandhi may lack the depth of a more academic approach, it is an old-fashioned, inspirational ode to a man who dared to challenge military power with self-restraint and political cunning.", "Gandhi is illustrative, but not creative. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Grievously doting and squeamishly evasive.", "The movie aims primarily to demonstrate how such a man could accomplish so much, but also how monumental his task was and how it ultimately claimed his life", "The inability to capture moments of simple, uncomplicated emotion show up the hollowness and over-staged theatricality of Richard Attenborough's Gandhi with exasperating frequency.", "They simply do not build movies like this any more, which is a pity.", "Tthe film Gandhi is more stuffy than stately, more prestigious than prodigious. It never quite captures the essence of Gandhi, or the influence he exerted on other leaders, including Martin Luther King. It's a broad but shallow river of information.", "Above all, Kingsley's astonishing performance, capturing both Gandhi's divine light and his irresistible simplicity, inspires this ambitious film.", "Attenborough shows once again his skill in managing the big set-piece.", "While Kingsley (who took one of eight Oscars) is the glue that holds this epic piece together, you must relish a cast that includes John Gielgud, Edward Fox, John Mills, Martin Sheen and Roshan Seth.", "It's a slow, reverential biopic, but it compensates for its sedate pace with a dry, gentle humour and a humanity that befits its extraordinary subject.", "Richard Attenborough's Gandhi is every bit as sumptuous as everyone had expected.", "Brilliant biography will engage preteens and up."], "rating": ["4.5", "7/10", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "4/5", "", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mark Jackson", "Mike Massie", "Andrew Robinson", "Molly Haskell", "Lawrence O&#39;Toole", "Susan Shapiro", "Rick Chatenever", "Michael Blowen", "Diego Gal\u00e1n", "Gary Arnold", "Rob Vaux", "Gita Mehta", "Kathleen Carroll", "David Sterritt", "Ralph Novak", "Philip French", "Andrew Collins", "", "Robert Hatch", "Liz Perle"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Epoch Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sight and Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Vogue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Maclean&#39;s Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sojourner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Santa Cruz Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Globe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema-stache", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Spectator", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Observer (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Nation", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media"], "date": ["November 10, 2020", "September 6, 2020", "March 16, 2020", "February 27, 2020", "February 6, 2020", "August 20, 2019", "February 5, 2019", "April 26, 2018", "March 1, 2018", "May 6, 2017", "February 28, 2017", "February 22, 2016", "February 17, 2015", "January 13, 2014", "January 13, 2014", "February 20, 2013", "February 20, 2013", "February 11, 2013", "February 11, 2013", "January 2, 2011"]}}
