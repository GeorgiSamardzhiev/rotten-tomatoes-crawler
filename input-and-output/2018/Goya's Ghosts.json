{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Brother Lorenzo (Javier Bardem), a member of the Spanish Inquisition, seeks to curry favor with the Inquisitor General by arresting the muse (Natalie Portman) of artist Francisco Goya (Stellan Skarsgard).

They don't just hit the social-political bull's-eye -- they obliterate it with a cannon and inadvertently scorch the dramatic landscape all around it.", "Captures the essence of the period -- an intriguing, backward era in Spain -- but without the emotional impact that such a film requires.", "Reminds us of the wisdom behind the title of Goya's most famous etching: 'The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters.'", "A disjointed oddity.", "Think of it as an Amadeus that doesn't work.", "Goya's Ghosts is less about the eponymous painter than it is a gripping two-part story of politics and faith during and after the Spanish Inquisition.", "Goya's Ghosts is a smart, darkly funny and deeply pessimistic film. It looks good and features wonderful performances.", "Forman ought to have put his film to The Question a little longer before letting it loose on the world.", "Goya's Ghosts has ambitious goals that it never fully attains. It proves intermittently fascinating but ultimately disappointing.", "What Forman doesn't give us is drama of sure coherence or credibility, but the trappings entrance.", "Goya's Ghosts uses the lives of artists and historical figures to show us the best and the worst of our human impulses.", "It's a richly seen and felt movie, but not one with a feel-good message."], "rating": ["2/5", "C+", "3/5", "3/5", "", "3/6", "3/5", "2.5/4", "C+", "2.5/4", "3/4", "2.5/5", "2/5", "4.5/5", "7", "C+", "", "2.5/4", "3/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Kaleem Aftab", "Dennis Schwartz", "Cliff Doerksen", "Cynthia Fuchs", "Fernando F.
