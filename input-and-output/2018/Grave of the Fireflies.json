Grave of the Fireflies falls into that exclusive category.", "This film isn't easy to watch but it's essential viewing among the great works of animation--or really of all film, for that matter.", "Once seen, this is seared in your heart, deep as your worst relationship break-up.", "Isao Takahata's masterpiece is one of the most profound anti-war statements ever brought to cinema", "...a well-made and heartfelt drama that's just not as engrossing as it should be.", "Such odd hopefulness, flitting around a child, mixed with the overwhelmingly sad, pervades Isao Takahata's film. And all around Seita and Setsuko, nature, in the face of human destruction and tragedy, persists in its beauty.", "The stylised images suit the simplicity and gravity of a grim story of love, sacrifice and survival in the face of adult indifference and cruelty.", "We're so used to seeing the human spirit triumph. Here, we're allowed to understand how it might fail.", "There are magical moments of natural beauty and childish delight, too - which only make the tragedy even more harrowing.", "The idea that \"War is Hell\" has almost become something of a climatic clich, but Takahata's film explores this well-worn slogan from new, exciting and harrowing angles.", "", "Isao Takahata's powerful anti-war movie is all the more harrowing for the care we invest in its beautifully drawn children.", "Japanimation WWII tragedy the saddest. Cartoon. Ever.", "The ephemeral fireflies, which fascinate the children and accompany them everywhere, become a potent and lyrical symbol of the fragility, brevity and beauty of life.", "Quivers with every kind of wracking emotion: rage, sorrow, despair, fatigue, and in the end, a tiny measure of hope that perhaps there's something better than this in the next world.", "The wonderful lasting mark of a true artist."], "rating": ["4.0/4", "", "", "3.5/4", "4/4", "", "5/5", "A+", "2.5/4", "", "", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "4/5", "5/5", "4/5", "", "1", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Glenn Kenny", "Chris Cabin", "James Berardinelli", "Charles Webb", "Larushka Ivan-Zadeh", "Christopher Runyon", "David Nusair", "Brian Gibson", "Philip French", "Charlotte O&#39;Sullivan", "Steve Rose", "David Jenkins", "", "Jamie Russell", "Charles Cassady", "Freda Freiberg", "Tim Brayton", "Felix Vasquez Jr."], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slant Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ReelViews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MTV", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Mezzanine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Alberta)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Observer (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Little White Lies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Senses of Cinema", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed"], "date": ["September 9, 2020", "August 29, 2019", "January 3, 2019", "December 30, 2018", "December 28, 2018", "July 3, 2018", "September 5, 2017", "February 20, 2014", "November 30, 2013", "July 11, 2013", "May 27, 2013", "May 24, 2013", "May 23, 2013", "May 23, 2013", "May 23, 2013", "May 14, 2013", "December 15, 2010", "July 30, 2010", "May 5, 2010", "April 29, 2009"]}}
