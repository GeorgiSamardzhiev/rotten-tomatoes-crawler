{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Stephanie Zinone (Michelle Pfeiffer) is the leader of Rydell High School's Pink Ladies, a gang of girls who are counterparts of the school's group of greasers called the T-Birds. Stephanie is tired of her relationship with top T-Bird Johnny Nogerelli (Adrian Zmed), so she breaks up with him and quickly catches the eye of English exchange student Michael Carrington (Maxwell Caulfield). Hoping to win her over, Michael tries to overcome his nerdy ways while holding off the jealous Johnny.", "rating": "36", "genre": "Comedy/Musical & Performing Arts/Romance", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Patricia Birch", "studio": "Paramount", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Its cast stuffed with old-school celebrities like Connie Stevens, Tab Hunter, Sid Ceasar and Eve Arden, its soundtrack cluttered with clunky new songs...", "What I want from this material is a stylized rock musical, and what I keep getting are stale Broadway routines.", "The original was a hard act to follow but this energetic sequel floats on a raft of ditties from the likes of Tab Hunter and Connie Stevens. That said, the questionable 'Reproduction' has to be heard to be believed.", "It is, in fact, something of a camp classic, enjoyable on its own terms and boasting a marvellously insouciant performance from Pfeiffer as the leader of the Pink Ladies.", "Unlike Grease's \"cool\" Rizzo (Stockard Channing), Stephanie doesn't have to be mean to anyone who doesn't fit into her Pink Lady standard. She's just cool, period.", "Grease 2 is a film with a female protagonist who is unabashedly herself to the judgment of her peers.", "Aimless and horribly dull, with its vigorous group dances failing to compensate for the insipid songs.", "The singing, dancing and staging isn't memorable in Grease 2. It's just imaginative and energetic enough to keep you interested. The same can be said for the whole film.", "This movie just recycles Grease, without the stars, without the energy, without the freshness and without the grease.", "It doesn't work, but you could spend the time spotting relatives of the stars.", "Definitely of the so-bad-it's-almost-good genre, this kinda stands the test of time in a camp way, mainly because of the charm of Pfeiffer and Carrington.", "I don't mean to deny the self-evident second-rateness of the project, just to suggest that it's preferable to the third-rateness that has become the norm in the genre.", "Grease is most emphatically not the word this summer.", "Grease 2 is the most serendipitous sequel in recent memory. It is an ingratiating, jubilant improvement on a crummy original.", "As a sequel to \"Grease\" it's terrible, and as a musical on its own merits, it's absolutely abysmal.", "Rizzo says \"no\" to this hacky sequel.", "Where this film has a decided edge on its predecessor is in the staging and cutting of the musical sequences.", "", "A gloriously unpretentious gem just waiting to be discovered. That the film hasn't yet received the full respect it deserves only adds to its charm.", ""], "rating": ["", "", "2/5", "", "", "", "2/5", "", "2/4", "2/5", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "2/5", "3.5/4", "0/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Dennis Harvey", "David Denby", "Sky Staff", "Jamie Graham", "Gwen Ihnat", "Courtney Enlow", "Tim Brayton", "Bruce McCabe", "Roger Ebert", "Sue Heal", "Emma Cochrane", "Dave Kehr", "", "Gary Arnold", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Heather Boerner", "Variety Staff", "Susan Granger", "Dustin Putman", "Michael Ferraro"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">48 Hills", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Magazine/Vulture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sky Cinema", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Digital Spy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AV Club", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Pajiba", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternate Ending", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Globe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Sun-Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Crazed", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">www.susangranger.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheFilmFile.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Threat"], "date": ["October 15, 2020", "September 10, 2020", "February 28, 2019", "February 27, 2019", "February 27, 2019", "February 27, 2019", "July 29, 2018", "April 27, 2018", "August 15, 2015", "August 15, 2015", "August 15, 2015", "August 15, 2015", "August 15, 2015", "August 15, 2015", "March 14, 2013", "December 18, 2010", "July 6, 2010", "September 15, 2007", "June 26, 2007", "May 20, 2006"]}}
