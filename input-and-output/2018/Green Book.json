{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Dr. Don Shirley is a world-class African-American pianist who's about to embark on a concert tour in the Deep South in 1962. In need of a driver and protection, Shirley recruits Tony Lip, a tough-talking bouncer from an Italian-American neighborhood in the Bronx. Despite their differences, the two men soon develop an unexpected bond while confronting racism and danger in an era of segregation.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 10m", "director": "Peter Farrelly", "studio": "CharlesB.WesslerEntertainment,InnisfreePictures", "theater_date": "Nov 21, 2018", "dvd_date": "Feb 19, 2019", "box_office": "$85.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Probably could have hit a little harder but its message of unity, of creating bridges rather than walls, is a welcome one in these politically divisive times.", "The two leads are quite impressive, managing to overcome the limitations of their largely stock roles.", "It's a movie about racism by whites for whites and in a year full of extraordinary films about race by black filmmakers, Green Book sticks out like a sore thumb partially because of that.", "it's light and breezy and matter-of-fact and truly, truly entertaining.", "Mahershala Ali and Viggo Mortensen are a match made in heaven. In its political correctness, it finds moments of truth. [Full review in Spanish]", "\"Green Book\" is one of those rare crowd pleasers with the chops to go the Oscar distance. It's a film most easily described as a reverse \"Driving Miss Daisy\" (1989) when really it's so much more than that.", "For the most part it's solid, even though it's about as subtle as a piano falling down a flight of stairs.", "Ali is stuck trying to breathe life into a cardboard cutout of a real person who . . . is left standing like an uncooked noodle who only curdles when the script lets him.", "...the relationship at its core helps to dilute its sentimentality before it overwhelms the film. Like Dr. Shirley, Green Book doesn't sell out entirely, just a little bit.", "A charming road trip movie which is truly affecting. Farrelly's has delivered a touchingly tender bromance story in the face of adversity.", "It's simple, has some good humour, and a very basic message about the power of friendship. [Full review in Spanish]", "What the film does is less idiotic, more insidious: it erases historical and institutional legacies of racism.", "A film that is charming with the couple of protagonists and with the distribution of genres that ends by leveling the biographical drama and comedy with a very successful rhythm. [Full review in Spanish]", "In the current climate the film feels less like the call to action we need than a comfy blanket and a cup cocoa letting us know 'it will all be all right'.", "It would have been far more profound if the film interrogated whether there is change and forgiveness for racists.", "Yet Farrelly and his cast deliver the cliches with such sincerity and good cheer that the film won me over anyway.", "While many might see this as a nice feel-good predictable film, they also forget that this was a story that needed to be told and was told because of the great outcome.", "It's inoffensive and emotionally generous and competently, if not imaginatively, shot. The colors are bright, the scenery pleasant. Both main characters get plenty of laugh lines.", "Green Book is well-meaning and competently made, but anodyne and ultimately ephemeral entertainment.", "An enthusiastic and well-intentioned but ultimately clich\u00e9d approach is abundantly evident in the final product."], "rating": ["4/5", "7/10", "", "3.5/4", "8/10", "4/4", "3/5", "2/5", "", "4/5", "", "", "7/10", "", "", "", "8/10", "3/5", "", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "Matthew St. Clair", "Richard Propes", "Victor Pineyro", "Jason Fraley", "Tom Beasley", "Matt Cipolla", "Scott Phillips", "Zehra Phelan", "Ricardo Gallegos", "CJ Sheu", "Yasser Medina", "Dan Tabor", "Rhod\u00e9 Marshall", "Ben Sachs", "Paul Salfen", "Neal Pollack", "Chris McCoy", "Matthew Rozsa"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Sentries", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seventh Art Studio", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WTOP (Washington, D.C.)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flickering Myth", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Monthly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Movie Isle", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flavourmag", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">P\u00f3lvora", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Critics at Large", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Phawker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">City Press (South Africa)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AMFM Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Book &amp; Film Globe", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Salon.com"], "date": ["February 3, 2021", "December 6, 2020", "October 2, 2020", "September 9, 2020", "September 2, 2020", "August 29, 2020", "August 16, 2020", "July 25, 2020", "July 24, 2020", "July 13, 2020", "July 7, 2020", "June 30, 2020", "June 27, 2020", "May 29, 2020", "April 15, 2020", "February 22, 2020", "February 14, 2020", "January 29, 2020", "January 21, 2020", "January 11, 2020"]}}
