Worse, the star tries to have it two ways, alternating between manic physical comedy and softspoken self-pity. The result if often awkward, and sometimes downright weird.", "To adults this poky movie may seem a bit sad. Lewis' once-manic energy is barely suggested in a few labored outbursts, and his lovable bewilderment is now more like bitterness.", "The movie's desperately amiable tone plays like a chastised boy's terrified plea for love; the oblivious cruelty that emerges nonetheless (as in Lewis's embarrassing parody of a Japanese chef) makes it all the sadder.", "I was absolutely stunned by the vast stupidity of this film.", "Hardly Working hardly works.", "", "Wow. Almost criminally bad.", "Cannonball in maven ... eeee ...yeah! My cat could eat a spool of celluloid and crap a better film than this.", "The result is utter confusion.", "Lewis has described this as his worst movie, but it also may be his most revealing one."], "rating": ["", "", "", "0/4", "1/4", "2/5", "1/5", "0/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Sterritt", "People Staff", "Richard Brody", "Roger Ebert", "", "Emanuel Levy", "Scott Weinberg", "Jonathan R.
