{"metadata": {"synopsis": "For Rod Kimball (Andy Samberg), performing stunts is a way of life, even though he is rather accident-prone. Poor Rod cannot even get any respect from his stepfather, Frank (Ian McShane), who beats him up in weekly sparring matches. When Frank falls ill, Rod devises his most outrageous stunt yet to raise money for Frank's operation -- and then Rod will kick Frank's butt.", "rating": "39", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Akiva Schaffer", "studio": "SNLStudios,ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "Aug 3, 2007", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$13.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The acting matches the movie's humor, which is to say that it's periodically mundane.", "Scenes with remarkable comic potential were sucked completely of their life.", "A charmless idiot, a clumsy rip-off of Jackass and one more tiresome exercise in arrested adolescence -- add them up and you have Hot Rod.", "Sandberg has a stubborn charm that should win over even the most jaded veteran of post-[Napoleon] Dynamite comedy.", "He'll break a few ribs -- you'll split your sides.", "The silly kills the funny. Every time things get rolling, some guy starts doing a ridiculous dance for no reason. Or Rod and his brother incessantly repeat the words \"cool beans.\"", "The Jackass-ification of mainstream American comedy continues, but where are the laughs?", "In the end, it's hard not to like a film whose characters celebrate their finest achievements by getting together and popping some bubblewrap,", "Rod's painful, amateur stunts wouldn't look out of place on YouTube. The rest of Samberg's humour is rather more patchy.", "People like me who are fans of sophomoric humor, it's a hoot.", "A perennial problem with comedy from regular collaborators is that the results feel too much like friends' in-jokes.", "Awesomely dumb slapstick is for teens and adults only.", "A remarkably unambitious yet moderately diverting time waster.", "The results are barely worth an illegal download.", "What works, wonderfully, are the falls, the punch-outs (his brawls with Stepdad are brutal throw-downs) and waiting for that next accident to happen.", "Oh, Napoleon Dynamite! What have you wrought? [Blu-ray]", "...comedy is a subjective thing, and what makes one person laugh may simply bore someone else. Hod Rod bored me.", "Instead of poking fun at its characters or using their interactions to drive the laughs, Hot Rod merely hopes that you're as willing as Samberg is to find it entertaining when comedians re-enact movie scenes from 20 years ago.", "Hot Rod emerges as a daffy, dorky summer surprise, a silly comedy of non sequiturs that feels like a cockeyed collaboration between Will Ferrell and Mel Brooks.", "...comes off as precisely the sort of silly and nonsensical piece of work that one might've expected..."], "rating": ["5/10", "1.5/4", "0/4", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "2/5", "4/5", "2/5", "3/5", "", "2/4", "3/5", "2/4", "4/10", "", "4/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "John Anderson", "Donald Clarke", "Tim Evans", "Lindy West", "Tim Robey", "Tom Cox", "Jamie Russell", "Kevin Carr", "Film4 Staff", "Heather Boerner", "Ron Yamauchi", "Brett Michel", "Roger Moore", "Peter Canavese", "John J.
