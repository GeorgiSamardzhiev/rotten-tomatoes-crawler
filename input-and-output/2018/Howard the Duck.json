{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this film based on the comic book character, Howard the Duck is suddenly beamed from Duckworld, a planet of intelligent ducks with arms and legs, to Earth, where he lands in Cleveland. There he saves rocker Beverly (Lea Thompson) from thugs and forms a friendship with her. She introduces him to Phil (Tim Robbins), who works at a lab with scientist Dr. Jenning (Jeffrey Jones). When the doctor attempts to return Howard to his world, Jenning instead transfers an evil spirit into his own body.", "rating": "13", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 51m", "director": "Willard Huyck", "studio": "UniversalPictures,LucasfilmLtd.", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$15.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["George Lucas, who is one of the kings of fairy tale fads, seems to have lost his ingenuousness or the ability to simulate it. [Full review in Spanish]", "There are a few good jokes along the way, but the final effect is that we've been here rather too many times before.", "Sound the horns, light the speakers, and cue the marching band, because Howard the Duck is here -- and bad movie historians could not ask for a more mallard-droit venture than this.", "Car crashes, explosions, chases. But nothing resembling a real plot or genuine characters.", "It's wildly overproduced and grievously underwritten: it's basically a duck Joke that cost as much as a small hospital.", "This creature with a mobile bill, scrawny body, and with a voice like Humphrey Bogart proves irritating beyond belief. Also, Howard has the glassy eyes of a doll and an artificiality that even his brusque, wise-quacking manner cannot quite conceal.", "This could have been a pretty entertaining, surreal exercise. But unfortunately, the heavy hand of Hollywood has turned this all into a low-level farce complete with overacting and terminally boring car and airplane chases.", "There must have been a terrible moment, many millions of collars into the production of Howard, when everyone realised it was not going to work either as comedy or thriller, as kid's stuff or sophisticated fore.", "Hey, what can I say? I hate this film.", "The plot might have provided a pleasant little fable if done with cartoon characters. But with live actors and a star duck that is not terribly convincing, the film just doesn't make it.", "The sophisticated tone of the project is set early on by its array of puns. Our hero reads Playduck magazine and has a wallet bursting with credit cards like Mallardcard and Bloomingducks. The problem is that these are the funniest things in the film.", "If there is any Justice, Howard the Duck brings us to the end of the line of special effects comedies.", "You have to wonder how such a movie could have been made the right way. You get the idea that the filmmakers were on the right track in the opening scenes, but soon lost their way.", "Mostly this is a noisy, abrasive, and supremely tasteless regression to the worst aspects of infantalism-as-big-business.", "[The script] is a long, rambling mishmash of not very comic events that quickly abandons Howard and his satirical potential to a blitz of spectacular, but tediously irrelevant special effects courtesy of Lucas's Industrial Light and Magic Co.", "If it's for children, it's in atrocious taste and steeped in so much special-effects violence that parents might think twice about taking [their kids]. If it's meant as a comic strip for teen-agers or young adults, the script insults the intelligence.", "Howard the Duck is a better movie for ducks than people. Send your favorite duck, but duck when Howard comes your way.", "The real problem is Howard himself, an utterly charmless, cigar-smoking boor, who is not helped by the script's sophomoric attempts at humour.", "When it's all over, Howard has earned his place along with Donald and Daffy among the greats of movie duckdom.", "There's good stuff around the edges of the film -- all that word play and all those visual gags demand that you pay attention lest you miss something even in the slow scenes But at the center no magic."], "rating": ["", "", "", "2/4", "", "", "2/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "1/4", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Octavi Marti", "David Stratton", "Michael Burkett", "Robert W.
