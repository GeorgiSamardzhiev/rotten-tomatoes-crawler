Majestic filmmaking.", "If Beale Street Could Talk demands your own eyes, yet it demands that those eyes be wide open to the harsh truths of the black experience and the power of love.", "How do you follow-up on a Best Picture masterpiece like \"Moonlight?\" If you're Barry Jenkins, you direct \"If Beale Street Could talk,\" the first narrative adaptation of James Baldwin.", "If Beale Street Could Talk leaves us with a resounding poetic message of profound beauty, love and enduring unity amongst social injustice.", "Jenkins' movie is sensitively and thoughtfully done, but almost inevitably reflects some of the problems of the identity politics-obsessed age.", "If Beale Street Could Talk is not a perfunctory adaptation, but a visceral account of blackness as resilient, tender and necessary.", "Visionary writer/director Barry Jenkins harnesses [author James] Baldwin's ear for the poetry of everyday life to create a film that miraculously manages to be an affirmation of the human spirit.", "If Beale Street Could Talk wraps itself up in an elusive sense of hope.
