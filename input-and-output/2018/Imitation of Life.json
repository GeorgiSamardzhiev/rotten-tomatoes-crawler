Probably, only the great Stahl could have brought to life such a masterpiece. The star setup was marvelous, and the acting of the adorable Claudette Colbert as well a Louis Beavers was superb.", "The race angle is treated with so obvious an attempt at tear-jerking that a good part of the Hurst appeal for increased colored tolerance is lost in a welter of sentimentality.", "A racial problem is handled in a very frank and convincing manner.", "When a studio, no matter how, or why, finds the courage to break a taboo, as in Imitation of Life, it is big news, and an occasion for rejoicing.", "We should hand It to Universal for making even a timid attempt to get away from the cut and dried formulae of cinema drama. It evidences a belief that the American movie public is maturing in Its tastes and tolerance.", "[Louise Beavers's] remarkable performance of Aunt Delilah lifts this film out of the ordinary routine of the cinema.", "At times [Imitation of Life] moves with rapidity from merriment to pathos. but it is enthralling throughout.", "Not so much an imitation as a fake, for life has a way of forcing conclusions and decisions, and this film, which never seems quite sure which way it is going, studiously avoids both.", "Unlike life, this film is very long: like life, it is frequently very dull.", "The outstanding performance incidentally, is given by Fredi Washington.", "Miss Colbert has never done anything finer or more heart-touching.", "It is the work of Miss Beavers [and] Fredi Washington that gives the picture its greatest grip on the emotions.", "Claudette Colbert steps into her emotional role and makes it an outstanding characterization.", "This adaptation of Fannie Hurst's novel dealing with race conventions lacks the original's pith, is awfully long, and does too much meandering.", "Miss Beavers does the best work of her screen career... and Miss Washington Is splendid as the daughter. There should be a place in fllmdom for the latter young player. She is an actress of genuine ability.", "[Louise Beavers] gives a splendid performance.", "One of the most meaningful pictures of the year, a vivid account to be remarked about again and again when informal groups start on the motion pictures.", "The scintillating performances of Claudette Colbert, Warren William, Louise Beavers and Fredi Washington in Imitation Of Life and the directorial ability of John M. Stahl will probably go down as the best of the year.", "For the most part, the players are so busy crying that they really find little time for acting."], "rating": ["", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Charlotta Bass", "Bernice Patton", "Wanda Hale", "Vere E.
