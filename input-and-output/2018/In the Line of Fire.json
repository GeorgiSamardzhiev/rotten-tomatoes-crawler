{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A Secret Service agent is taunted by calls from a would-be killer who has detailed information about the agent - including the fact that he failed to save President John F.

I'm just not sure we have a Clint Eastwood anymore to save America from itself.", "Aside from getting a little too nasty to guarantee audience attention during flat spots, this is a quality political thriller with a few choice personal twists.", "A top-notch thriller, the movie's traditional values concerning classic first-responder, law enforcement, and Secret Service/FBI/CIA-agent hero-types who dutifully put their lives on the line for patriotism remains one of the best examples of the genre.", "John Malkovich plays one of the screen's most memorable and often underrated villains.", "Generously exciting, In the Line of Fire is mercifully free of that artificial energy that makes so many new movies look as if they were created with steroids.", "...a seriously superior thriller that remains, more than 20 years later, one of the best examples of the genre.", "Directed by Wolfgang Petersen, In the Line of Fire builds a palpable tension between the Eastwood and Malkovich characters.", "It just builds, relationship by relationship, detail by detail, clever stroke by clever stroke, taking you in and making you its own. It ought to wear a sign: Danger. Professionals At Work.", "Petersen directs his film in a straightforward, workmanlike fashion-few surprises here -- and, curiously, for most of the film is better at establishing a kind of amiability than a hard tension.", "Director Wolfgang Petersen moves the story along, but his real job is to simply stay out of the way of his two racehorse lead actors. And he does.", "What separates In The Line Of Fire from the rest of the bog-standard good-guy/bad-guy set-up is the clear implication throughout that these two sworn enemies have more in common than they may think.", "Eerie assassin and protector are perfectly balanced in this classy entertainment.", "Every part of this film trades so heavily on Eastwood's presence that it is impossible to imagine it with anyone else in the starring role.", "The movie has a clear, simple thriller logic that's far more satisfying than the static variations-on-a-massacre construction of Eastwood's Dirty Harry pictures and spaghetti Westerns.", "Despite the presence of all these action-flick cliches, In the Line of Fire works. Sure, it's no more than a formula movie, but it's an effective formula movie.", "Preposterous but still thoroughly involving, this tense, kinetic, ingenious thriller is the thinking fan's action movie.", "How fitting that in this summer of dinosaurs, Clint Eastwood has again emerged as the most interesting thing on screen.", "Between them, director Petersen and screenwriter Jeff Maguire do a memorable job developing their characters in this story of personal and professional redemption.", "[Peterson] keeps his new film hopping at a lively pace, and he shows sensitivity to the look and feel of American politics.", "If you don't care about such motivations, this is a pretty good thriller, though not one you're likely to remember for very long."], "rating": ["3/5", "3.5/5", "4/5", "9/10", "", "3.5/4", "3/4", "3.5/4", "3/4", "3/4", "5/5", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Tony Black", "Leigh Paatsch", "Mark Jackson", "Mike Massie", "David Ansen", "David Nusair", "Dennis King", "Stephen Hunter", "Clifford Terry", "Gene Siskel", "Barry McIlheney", "Film4 Staff", "Kenneth Turan", "Terrence Rafferty", "Jay Boyar", "Ralph Novak", "Gary Thompson", "Carrie Rickey", "David Sterritt", "Jonathan Rosenbaum"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cultural Conversation", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Epoch Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tulsa World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Baltimore Sun", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New Yorker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader"], "date": ["January 31, 2021", "December 20, 2020", "December 12, 2020", "September 14, 2020", "January 29, 2019", "May 18, 2016", "August 13, 2014", "July 30, 2013", "July 30, 2013", "July 30, 2013", "July 30, 2013", "July 30, 2013", "July 30, 2013", "July 30, 2013", "July 30, 2013", "July 30, 2013", "July 30, 2013", "July 30, 2013", "July 30, 2013", "July 30, 2013"]}}
