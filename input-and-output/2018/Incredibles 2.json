It's a heartfelt joy with a commendable stab at social commentary. A roller coaster of a ride this is one sequel and superhero movie that beats the enemy with graceful joy.", "This is a by-the-numbers redux of the first Incredibles movie - it's fun to watch, but it's too predictable to be truly gripping.", "It's nice to see that the fourteen year wait was worth it.", "It turns out that there not only is a place for such a richly animated work like Incredibles 2, but that it seems almost imperative that it exists to remind us that it's not impossible for these films to have a beating heart behind the chest emblem.", "It's still a fun movie to watch.", "On a whole, it's still fun and cute.", "Incredibles 2 might be a cash grab for NYSE:DIS, but, thankfully, not the artists behind the project. Here's a rare sequel that matches the original by narrowing its focus.", "Incredibles 2 gets an easy pass on character strength alone.", "While original, witty and super entertaining, this 14-year sequel also poses as a cautionary tale for future Pixar \"family films.\" Disappointing in that regard", "It's a genuine crowd pleaser that rewards viewing on the big screen, which is what a summer movie is all about.", "The plot is compelling, there are plenty of laughs and the message is contemporary.", "My first thought upon leaving the theater after Incredibles 2 is that Disney should make it a policy to wait a decade-and-a-half between sequels.", "Every frame is packed with fantastic detail and cutting-edge animated magic while staying true to the original movie's charming visual feel.", "You're in for a real treat with Incredibles 2."], "rating": ["6/10", "4/5", "2.0/4", "4/5", "5/5", "3/5", "4/5", "6/10", "B+", "", "", "", "B+", "3.5/5", "7/10", "", "", "", "", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Paul McGuire Grimes", "Richard Propes", "Stephen A.
