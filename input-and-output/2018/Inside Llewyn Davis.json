{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1961 New York City, folk singer Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is at a crossroads. Guitar in hand, he struggles against seemingly insurmountable obstacles to make a name for himself in the music world, but so far, success remains elusive. Relying on the kindness of both friends and strangers, Llewyn embarks on an odyssey that takes him from the streets of Greenwich Village to a Chicago club, where awaits a music mogul who could give him the big break that he desperately needs.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Joel Coen, Ethan Coen", "studio": "StudioCanal", "theater_date": "Dec 20, 2013", "dvd_date": "Mar 11, 2014", "box_office": "$13.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A fictional look at the vibrant Greenwich Village folk scene but this isn't a history, it's a feel. It gives us an under-the-covers look at struggles and naked ambition it takes to get noticed.", "It's not until almost halfway through that the odd occurrences and even stranger characters begin to surface.", "Isaac and the Coen brothers have imparted their character with no shortage flaws, but he should be immensely empathetic for anyone who's ever attempted to carve out their own place in the overwhelmingly world of music.", "The film will appeal to true Coen purists.", "Out of all the Coen Brothers' films, Inside Llewyn Davis has to be their most heartfelt and sentimental film I've watched.", "Even with Oscar Isaac's good performance, it doesn't have the energy or dynamism that characterizes the Coens' style. [Full review in Spanish]", "Goofy plot digressions and a Kerouac-worthy subplot deliver the season's most original comedy/drama...", "Inside Llewyn Davis manipulates those narratives to create an amalgam that seems determined to deform them. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The Coen Brothers do create one of their most complex characters in Llewyn Davis.", "Inside Llewlyn Davis looks and sounds fantastic, but the indecisive performances from its cast and the aimless story isn't enough to captivate this reviewer.", "[A] remarkable film that is both amusing character study and profound treatise about unrealised ambition, the cruel nature of fate and the omnipresent possibility of failure.", "Elegiac yet hilarious, beautiful yet melancholy, Inside Llewyn Davis is one of the Coens' finest films to date.", "Perhaps the most infuriating thing about Inside Llewyn Davis is how rabidly (and anachronistically) apolitical it is.", "The Coen brothers are nonpareil pastiche artists, capable of burrowing deeply enough into the cultural gestalt of particular moments of twentieth-century America to render a facsimile that feels right without being slavish.", "Featuring a breakthrough lead turn from Oscar Isaac as a struggling folk singer, the Coens have returned to the high watermark of such classic efforts as Miller's Crossing and Barton Fink.", "... a lot of emotional turmoil for a movie where not a lot actually happens, which is where the Coen magic kicks in.", "The film is full of the typical Coen wit and style, and also features a brilliant soundtrack and strong work from Isaac.", "It's a slice-of-life film featuring wonderful folk compositions... and Oscar Isaacs, as Llewyn, takes the starring opportunity and runs with it.", "It is ultimately a film about much life can suck when you try to follow a dream, enough to the point it can make that dream seem undesirable, yet the path remains inescapable.", "A few films have also capitalized on this tradition, but Inside Llewyn Davis may be one of the most captivating with a first-rate soundtrack and fascinating though somber narrative."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "8/10", "4/5", "3.5/4", "4/5", "6/10", "", "", "3.7/5", "3/5", "5/5", "5/5", "", "", "5/5", "", "A-", "", "8/10", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Mike Massie", "Jordan M.
