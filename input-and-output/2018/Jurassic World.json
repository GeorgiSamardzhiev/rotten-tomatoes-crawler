{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Located off the coast of Costa Rica, the Jurassic World luxury resort provides a habitat for an array of genetically engineered dinosaurs, including the vicious and intelligent Indominus rex. When the massive creature escapes, it sets off a chain reaction that causes the other dinos to run amok. Now, it's up to a former military man and animal expert (Chris Pratt) to use his special skills to save two young brothers and the rest of the tourists from an all-out, prehistoric assault.", "rating": "70", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 4m", "director": "Colin Trevorrow", "studio": "AmblinEntertainment,UniversalPictures,LegendaryPictures", "theater_date": "Jun 12, 2015", "dvd_date": "Sep 6, 2016", "box_office": "$652.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Several sequences of dinosaur carnage are expertly crafted and thoroughly entertaining, even if they're repetitive of previous entries in the franchise.", "It's easily the best of the sequels, but it certainly falls short of the original's sense of surprise and spontaneity that marked the original.", "Whilst it will never touch the greatness of the original and shamelessly predictable, Jurassic World is a positive entry in the franchise.", "If you squint really hard, you might find this to be good old dumb fun. But honestly, how long can you do that before getting a headache?", "Clumsy, full of flat, dead-eyed characters, and is an obvious cash grab. But somehow none of that matters when there are rampaging dinosaurs on screen.", "Overall, Jurassic World delivers. It's everything you probably want or expect from a summer blockbuster sequel. It's still scary when it needs to be, funny when it tries and a worthy continuation of the story.", "Yes, I said it. \"Jurassic World\" SUCKED! What the hell was I missing?", "The production flirted dangerously with the \"video game phase\" syndrome that had done so much damage to the previous two installments of the franchise. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Once again MacDonald's cinema at our service: fast consumption and instant forgetfulness. [Full Review in Spanish]", "It was very cynical, which bummed me out.", "This movie should not exist.", "It doesn't help that the screenplay, credited to four writers, repeatedly veers into the idiotic.", "Jurassic World is not a misfire, just a pale reflection of Jurassic Park... But I had fun rooting for the dinosaurs anyway.", "Jurassic World doesn't even come close.", "An accomplished sequel, and a delightful stand-alone picture in its own right, at its core, Jurassic World is cheesy, dumb, balls-to-the-wall crazy fun.", "Despite my view of the film as a satire, there are a few storylines that bogged down an otherwise quick fire film.", "There are still enough moments of excitement and wonder to inspire audiences to take the dino-bait and commit to seeing Jurassic World through to the end.", "Jurassic World is terrific spectacle paced perfectly and infused with more humor than any previous installment of the series. It is grownups playing with dinosaur toys, and if you did that as a kid, you'll leave with a big, dumb grin on your face.", "A welcome return to form for a beloved franchise that delivers the goods for a whole new generation.", "Jurassic World possesses what this series has lacked since Jurassic Park: heart."], "rating": ["6/10", "3.0/4", "3/5", "C+", "B-", "", "2/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "1.7", "8/10", "", "3/5", "B+", "3/4", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Allen Almachar", "Brent McKnight", "Damond Fudge", "Matthew Rozsa", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Alberto Abu\u00edn", "Avaryl Halley", "Andrew Galdi", "Tim Brennan", "Chris McCoy", "David Harris", "Joey Keogh", "Karl Delossantos", "Leslie Combemale", "Ryan Syrek", "Matthew Lucas", "Daniel Orton"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Confessions From A Geek Mind", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Last Thing I See", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KCCI (Des Moines, IA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Good Men Project", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">About Boulder", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wicked Horror", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Smash Cut Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Reader (Omaha, NE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Dispatch (Lexington, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View"], "date": ["December 4, 2020", "September 13, 2020", "July 17, 2020", "July 15, 2020", "July 5, 2020", "July 1, 2020", "June 11, 2020", "May 7, 2020", "April 28, 2020", "April 28, 2020", "April 28, 2020", "February 13, 2020", "January 10, 2020", "December 3, 2019", "September 26, 2019", "August 8, 2019", "August 5, 2019", "July 30, 2019", "July 5, 2019", "May 8, 2019"]}}
