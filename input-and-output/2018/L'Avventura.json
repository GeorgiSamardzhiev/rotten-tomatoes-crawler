{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In Michelangelo Antonioni's classic of Italian cinema, two lovely young women, Claudia (Monica Vitti) and Anna (L\u00e9a Massari), join the latter's lover, Sandro (Gabriele Ferzetti), on a boat trip to a remote volcanic island. When Anna goes missing, an extensive search is launched. In the meantime, Sandro and Claudia become involved in a romance despite Anna's disappearance, though the relationship suffers from the guilt and tension brought about by the looming mystery.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Art House & International/Classics/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 25m", "director": "Michelangelo Antonioni", "studio": "Societ\u00e9Cin\u00e9matographiqueLyre", "theater_date": "Mar 4, 1961", "dvd_date": "Jun 2, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An original game changer, Antonioni spun cinema into a direction of new possibilities, down avenues well-traveled now by generations of filmmakers since.", "Compared to movies, period, L'Avventura is good. But \"good\" for Antonioni is too flat and monotonous a praise, much like this picture.", "Sandro and Claudia spend almost the entire film chasing a ghost, but in doing so are really uncovering the fragility of everything their complacent lives had held so concrete.", "An assault on modernity that transformed modern cinema.", "The best picture I've seen since Hiroshima, Mon Amour.", "Rightly considered to be a cinematic landmark.", "Antonioni's cool, beautifully photographed film isn't really a mystery and certainly not a thriller. Audiences over the years have delighted in deciding what it really is all about.", "The film just looks great. That black and white cinematography is just divine.", "For those who love obscure European cinema this is one of the true masterpieces.", "The adventure was not merely sexual, however, but a radical rethink of film language: the characters' motivations were left opaque and unexplained, and the story never quite resolves itself -- rather like life.", "L'Avventura eschews conventional narrative drive or sophomoric emotional satisfaction in favour of gorgeous compositions, inimitable style and an acerbic sensibility.", "This is a world without design, where characters can no longer single-mindedly pursue goals and resolve problems.", "Antonioni's film rewrote the language of cinema, questioning its addiction to storytelling and opening up the possibility for other, more enigmatic and poetic forms of expression.", "There are certain things audiences have come to expect from the plots of motion pictures, and even in 2014, L'avventura feels angry and fresh because it upends those expectations gleefully. Being anti-plot doesn't necessarily mean that its plotless.", "It's easy to bash Antonioni as passe. It's harder, I think, to explain the cinematic power of the way his camera watches, and waits, while the people on screen stave off a dreadful loneliness.", "Always fusing neo-realism with science-fiction, Antonioni's world is one of superficies and emotions hardening into titanium", "Antonioni created, as the Cannes jury put it in 1960, a new language of cinema, one that perfectly expressed a modern alienation that's enduring as well as the film.", "Carelessness - physical, emotional, intellectual and relational - is something of a virus in the film.", "[VIDEO ESSAY] \"L'avventura\" is a haunting film that presages Fellini's post-modern cinema, and informs the French New Wave that gave way to such iconic auteurs as Jean Luc Goddard.", "A graduate of Screenwriting 1-2 might dismiss this method as casualness or even carelessness, but every shot and bit of business in L'Avventura represents calculation of the highest order."], "rating": ["5/5", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "4/5", "5/5", "1", "4.5/5", "4.5/5", "4/4", "", "", "4/4", "A+", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nicholas Bell", "Stewart Allen", "PJ Nabarro", "Asher Luberto", "Dwight MacDonald", "Richard Brody", "David Stratton", "Margaret Pomeranz", "David Parkinson", "Kate Muir", "Christopher Machell", "Christopher Long", "Scott Tobias", "Eric Melin", "Michael Phillips", "Fernando F.
