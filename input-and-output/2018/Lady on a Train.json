{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Young, pleasant Nikki Collins (Deanna Durbin) witnesses a brutal murder while riding on a train on her way to New York City. Though she desperately tries to inform others of what she saw, no one believes her. In her scramble to convince someone, anyone, of the crime, she finds an ally in a mystery writer named Wayne Morgan (David Bruce). Trapped as she is on the train, however, the more she tries to raise the alarm, the more attention she draws to herself -- and the killer is starting to notice.", "rating": "71", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "Charles David", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 10, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's an empty and careless little fable, intended to be a mystery farce, about the wholly incredible mix-up of a debutante in a murder plot.", "Deanna Durbin [is] caught at that awkward stage when Universal seemed to have no idea what to do with the rapidly maturing girl who had been the studio's biggest star in the 30s.", "Lady on a Train sets out to elicit chills and chuckles, but never quite reaches its modest destination.", "[Durban's] 'fans' -- and they are many -- should respond with breathless infatuation.", "Light, cheery and shading into darker areas for the climax, it's fun.", "Lady on a Train should stand as a classic example of miscasting a leading role. Lady in a Trance would have been a far more appropriate title.", "As we say, you will find it amusing at isolated intervals, particularly those in which Deanna shows that she has grown up enough artistically to be quite a commedienne when her material is worth working on.", "Miss Durbin bounces bloomingly through a lushly rococo nightmare in which anything goes.", "It's a lot of fun in that slick 1940s way.", "An enjoyable romp.", "Lady on a Train is a mystery comedy containing plenty of fun for both whodunnit and laugh fans.", "[Durbin's] singing of Night and Day is the high-note of the movie.", "A delightful thriller unusual in that it's loaded with laughs, having been written by Beloin and O'Brien, who churned out the scripts for Jack Benny's radio shows.
