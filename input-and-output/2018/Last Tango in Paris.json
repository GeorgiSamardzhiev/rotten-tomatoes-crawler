{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Distraught following his wife's suicide, American hotelier Paul (Marlon Brando) becomes transfixed by the beautiful younger Frenchwoman Jeanne (Maria Schneider) when he meets her by chance at an apartment both are attempting to rent. The couple begin an extended but purely anonymous sexual relationship in which they do not even tell each other their names, but it soon becomes clear that the couple's deliberate level of disassociation cannot continue.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 10m", "director": "Bernardo Bertolucci", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Some of the improvisational small talk ends up being lightly amusing, but nothing about this picture can overcome the potency of the sex scenes.", "[Brando provides] two sequences of such power, of such piercing emotional intensity and perception, that he brings an aura of greatness to the entire film. It is, alas, only an aura, for the film is all machismo.", "Everything in the movie is presented somewhat vaguely, which grants it a certain interest that we could call fascination, if weren't about something more evident, fundamental, honest, and spontaneous. [Full Review in Spanish]", "In this age where the human behavior system is rarely an important facet in film narratives, here is a picture that still throbs with all the pain and misery of its deep emotional wounds.", "What makes it work is it is grounded in real life. It's a story and a character study with a strong philosophical framework and people that are recognisably human. Factor in superb filmmaking, saturated sensual natural light and cinematography.", "Regardless of all its solos, failed majesties, and off-the-mark horrors, even as a highly imperfect adventure, it is still the best adventure in film to be seen in this pullulating year.", "When Brando improvises within Bertolucci's structure, his full art is realized; his performance is intuitive, rapt, princely. Working with Brando, Bertolucci achieves realism with the terror of actual experience still alive on the screen.", "A film that loses all interest and is even quite unbearable when Brando is not on screen. [Full review in Spanish]", "The sex scenes that made the film famous are just a symptom of a deep pain and also its treatment. [Full review in Portuguese.]", "Brando gives a terrific performance, but Bertolucci's movie as a whole, which was so bold and audacious in 1972, does not hold up very well.", "Took the world by storm with its strategy of sexual frankness and a towering performance by Marlon Brando. [Blu-ray]", "This emotional, sexual jumble of a movie still contains some interesting ideas, and some gorgeous cinematic poetry.", "High Art moments are offset by the grossly misogynistic behavior of Brando's character and scenes and dialogue that can seem so insipid that they negate any real eroticism or serious shock value.", "But when we look at this film, it signals a feeble turn towards art house eroticism which is tame by today's standards. For as Maria Schneider herself says ', we've seen much worse'.", "Bernardo Bertolucci's 1972 masterpiece of post-modern existential angst is an irrefutable art film that attempts to reconcile a depth of social existence through its sexually liberated characters.", "Brando gives his all but just ends up becoming himself. Interesting for its historical notoriety, but overlong and dull in places.", "An uneven, convoluted, certainly dispute-provoking study of sexual passion in which Marlon Brando gives a truly remarkable performance.", "Not to be missed.", "The operatic extravagance of Bernardo Bertolucci's style has emerged more clearly since this 1972 drama, which still managed to seem vaguely naturalistic in the midst of its extravagant camera moves and eccentric construction.", ""], "rating": ["2/10", "", "", "4/4", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "B+", "3.5/4", "", "6/10", "B+", "A+", "3/5", "", "4/4", "", "4.5/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Judith Crist", "Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos", "David Keyes", "Anne Brodie", "Norman Mailer", "Pauline Kael", "Alberto Abu\u00edn", "Pablo Villa\u00e7a", "Emanuel Levy", "Peter Canavese", "Jeffrey M.
