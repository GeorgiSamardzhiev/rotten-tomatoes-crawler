{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Filmed during the annual 24-hour endurance race at Le Mans, France, in 1970, this fast-paced drama follows Michael Delaney (Steve McQueen), a Porsche driver haunted by the memory of an accident at the previous year's race in which a competing driver was killed. To top things off, Delaney also finds himself increasingly infatuated with the man's widow (Elga Andersen). The minimal storyline focuses on Delaney's race-long rivalry with his Ferrari-driving archnemesis, Erich (Siegfried Rauch).", "rating": "67", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Lee H.
