[Full Review in Spanish]", "[Jorge] Grau delivers all the stumbling zombies and gory flesh feasts you could hope for in a 1974 movie, but more importantly he creates the rare zombie thriller that manages to be both scary and smartly done.", "Scenic settings, guts, and a residual contact high from the counterculture movement converge in one of the zombie genre's most unique and enjoyable entries.", "Much of the pleasure of this UK take on Night Of The Living Dead comes from seeing the undead wandering round the grey landscape of '70s Britain as if they've accidentally lurched into an early Mike Leigh film.", "It's artfully atmospheric, capturing a nightmarish landscape in the idyllic English countryside.", "Doom hangs over the thing like a pall.", "... Grau delivers the gore with a certain amount of restraint, never allowing the violence to overwhelm the film and building up a good amount of suspense between attacks.", "This minor cult classic has its fans, to be sure, but it never really pays off.", "Artfully builds its atmosphere of spiritual (and social) unrest.", "Cpia nada ambiciosa de A Noite dos Mortos Vivos que, apesar de tudo, se revela bastante interessante e incmoda.", "Director Jorge Grau has an incredible eye and creates a lavish horror spectacle.", "", "", "Any laughter soon turns to screaming as the screen fills with calculated gory mayhem and some fine shock moments.", "offers everything a genre fan would want in a good zombie flick"], "rating": ["", "", "", "4/5", "", "4.5/5", "", "8/10", "", "A-", "3/4", "", "2/4", "B+", "4/5", "8/10", "2/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Chris Alexander", "Kyle Anderson", "Meagan Navarro", "Steve &quot;Uncle Creepy&quot; Barton", "Brian Collins", "John Tones", "Sean Axmaker", "Brian Juergens", "Ian Berriman", "Dennis Schwartz", "Walter Chaw", "Felix Gonzalez Jr.", "Eric Henderson", "Rob Humanick", "Pablo Villa\u00e7a", "Alex Sandell", "Emanuel Levy", "Nicolas Lacroix", "Almar Haflidason", "James Kendrick"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alexander On Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Nerdist", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bloody Disgusting", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dread Central", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Birth.Movies.Death.", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Stream on Demand", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CampBlood.org", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">SFX Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Freak Central", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">DVD Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Slant Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Projection Booth", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema em Cena", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Juicy Cerebellum", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EnPrimeur.ca", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">BBC.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Q Network Film Desk"], "date": ["June 9, 2020", "March 20, 2020", "March 20, 2020", "March 20, 2020", "October 8, 2019", "March 4, 2019", "March 2, 2018", "June 22, 2011", "August 23, 2010", "September 28, 2008", "May 27, 2008", "March 17, 2008", "February 28, 2008", "October 27, 2007", "March 20, 2006", "September 28, 2005", "August 27, 2005", "April 27, 2004", "July 24, 2001", "July 24, 2001"]}}
