However, the South Africans are protected by diplomatic immunity, and so the two are assigned to witness-protection duty in an attempt by their captain to keep his job. It is only when this witness reveals to them that he has already dealt with the smugglers that the trouble really starts.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Richard Donner", "studio": "WarnerBros.,SilverPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 15, 2008", "box_office": "$144.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Director Richard Donner returns, with all of the original cast and more of the same buddy-cop chemistry and wild shenanigans that made the first feature so much fun.", "If you don't mind your comic books being filled with incessant shootings, explosions, knifings, drownings, stranglings, car crashes, fires and the use of automatic nail drivers as weapons, it's a lot of fun.", "Director Richard Donner accents humour rather than explosive action and the result is an oddly toned, cartoon-like adventure with the comedy elements making the nasty violence seem even more gratuitous.", "Mediocre. [Full Review in Spanish]", "[T]here's a sense in which all these recent one-against-a-hundred cop and war thrillers represent the gaudy degeneration of the great tradition of the American action movie: substituting hardware for atmosphere...", "As a sequel it is a notable risk to take the route of a more bitter and dark tone. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Unlike most sequels Lethal Weapon 2 is neither predictable nor conventional. It's just pumped full of juice.", "The team is back to good effect, and the pairing of Gibson and Glover possesses more chemistry than most romantic screen couples.", "A palpably superior sequel...", "I've confused a lot of the good things I remember about the first film with good stuff that in actuality happened in the second.", "Pesci's terrific comic performance really gooses the proceedings, but the film also works because of its exciting action content, the presence of Patsy Kensit as Riggs' love interest, and the series-best interplay between the two lead characters.", "Sequel adds Joe Pesci to the buddy cop formula.", "One of the finest examples of the genre, and, in my humble estimation, one of the greatest sequels put to film. Perhaps deranged hyperbole, but rarely does a follow-up outgun the original film as swiftly as Lethal 2 does.", "Better than the first!", "Returning director Richard Donner seems to have smoothed over the few stylistic rough edges remaining from the earlier film to deliver here two hours of pure, breathless, high-impact entertainment.", "Probably the best film in the series to date.", "Loaded with the usual elements, Lethal Weapon 2 benefits from a consistency of tone that was lacking in the first film.", "Kick ass sequel", "...funnier, more exciting, and more action-packed than the others in the series.", "Too jokey and cutesy.
