{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Teenage Cady Heron (Lindsay Lohan) was educated in Africa by her scientist parents. When her family moves to the suburbs of Illinois, Cady finally gets to experience public school and gets a quick primer on the cruel, tacit laws of popularity that divide her fellow students into tightly knit cliques. She unwittingly finds herself in the good graces of an elite group of cool students dubbed \"the Plastics,\" but Cady soon realizes how her shallow group of new friends earned this nickname.", "rating": "84", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 37m", "director": "Mark Waters", "studio": "ParamountPictures,M.G.Films", "theater_date": "Apr 30, 2004", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$86.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Startlingly genuine when it comes to dialogue, stereotypes, coteries, and high school drama.", "Fans of teen films will find much to like here, and those who have not so fond memories of high school will chuckle with familiarity.", "If Mean Girls the movie had a human form, it would easily be the most popular kid in school. And like the vicious gossip that spreads throughout high school, Mean Girls has become an inescapable part of the cultural consciousness.", "Mean Girls is a funnier and more insightful movie than your average teen comedy.", "Speaking to anyone who has survived the jungles of high school, Mean Girls has something for everyone. The refreshingly honest appeal of this film is ageless.", "Like Heathers and Clueless, this box office hit turns out to be that rare teen flick that refuses to be pigeonholed as a teen flick.", "This is an all-star cast at the beginnings of their careers and their talent is evident even at this early stage.", "A very funny teen comedy", "When we think of the great high school comedies, Mean Girls is near the top of the list because it's so fetch.", "Mean Girls plays like the messed-up love child of filmmakers Hughes and Michael Lehmann in their 80s incarnations, which is like sooo in.", "Mean Girls is not only of the one most enjoyable films of the 21st century but it is also one that explores the wonderful comedic potential of women.", "When the film is following the twists and turns of the mean girl schemes, it has an energy and a life that is fun and entertaining but it gets soft and sappy with a feel good finale that is pure grade A-bullshit.", "Fizzes with peculiarly feminine evil, of the kind that comes dripping through a pillowy smirk garnished with baby-pink lipgloss.", "The best of the recent clutch of teen movies, Mean Girls also represents a return to form for the filmmaking wing of Saturday Night Live.", "Mature but often-hilarious teen comedy.", "Lindsay Lohan is more likely to die before 30 than to land another lead role as suited to her (likely squandered) talent. Tina Fey's script is an observant equal-opportunity offender about how high school remains a jungle of hormones and haughtiness.", "Like Heathers with the edges filed down a bit...the kind of smooth, clever (and rare) entertainment that critics and audiences can all enjoy, guilt-free.
