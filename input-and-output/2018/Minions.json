{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Evolving from single-celled yellow organisms at the dawn of time, Minions live to serve, but find themselves working for a continual series of unsuccessful masters, from T. Rex to Napoleon. Without a master to grovel for, the Minions fall into a deep depression. But one minion, Kevin, has a plan; accompanied by his pals Stuart and Bob, Kevin sets forth to find a new evil boss for his brethren to follow. Their search leads them to Scarlet Overkill, the world's first-ever super-villainess.", "rating": "55", "genre": "Animation/Comedy/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 31m", "director": "Pierre Coffin, Kyle Balda", "studio": "IlluminationEntertainment", "theater_date": "Jul 10, 2015", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$336.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Rarely attempts to appeal directly to a grown-up audience, instead concentrating all efforts on colorful, sophomoric spectacles and rambunctious escapades.", "I'll even admit that Kevin sits proudly on my desk at work while Bob, the enthusiastic young one, is staring at me even as I write this review.", "Minions is a great idea, fairly competently executed, that ends up suffering at the hands of its own distributor ... All of the really funny moments that enticed me to come see the flick ended up being ALL of the really funny moments.", "Let's start with what Minions gets right: It's a mercifully short 93 minutes long. But even at that length, it still feels padded.", "The plot gets ever more convoluted, the jokes ever more lazy, hinging mostly on country stereotypes. Some of the best gags have zilch to do with either the story or the minions, come out of nowhere and lead to nothing.", "Just put on a happy face with Minions!", "Considering that this prequel is a full-length feature film about characters incapable of coherent dialogue, it certainly isn't as miserable as the calculated nature of its creation suggested. What a ringing endorsement, right?", "Everything about it is a weak excuse to give the Minions something outlandish to do, but there isn't a particularly strong thread running through any of it.", "An endless roll of jokes ensures this is sublime dumb-but-smart entertainment.", "The worst thing about it is it just isn't funny at all and the story is all over the place.", "This film should be prefaced by a warning message like you'd find on a pack of cigarettes... \"BEWARE: Long-Term Exposure to the Minions Could Carry Serious Health Risks.\"", "Minions will definitely appeal to its target audience -- the slapstick humor is right in the wheelhouse for children. The problem is the film doesn't have enough to maintain the interest of adults who come along with the kiddies.", "It promises a chaotic, anarchic movie that it fails to deliver - forcing characters who are by very definition destructive and unpredictable into a formulaic three act structure that can be wrapped up nicely in 90 minutes.", "Pacing is problematic; there may be too much Minionism and too little relief. The comic set pieces aren't threaded together at points, but there are many smiles to be had.", "[It's] a film that both adults and children can enjoy together, and clever editing wraps everything up in 91 minutes-the perfect timing for a family film.", "Parents, I would recommend sending the kids with the babysitter to this one. It's worth the price to pay for one more to go when that \"one more\" isn't you.", "One can't help but think that Minions would have been much better off being a short film rather than a full-length animated feature.", "It betrays its own motivation of being purely for kids with its failed endeavors to bridge its grating humor to thinking adults.", "There is only so much you can do with a bare-bones plot featuring little to no character development", "If it's a cheerful chuckle-along that you and your family are after, then Minions certainly fits the bill.
