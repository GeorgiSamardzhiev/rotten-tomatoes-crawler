{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In director Jean-Luc Godard's landmark drama, Nana (Anna Karina), a young Parisian woman who works in a record shop, finds herself disillusioned by poverty and a crumbling marriage. Hoping to become an actress and break into films, Nana is once again disappointed when nothing comes of her dreams, and soon she turns to a bleak life of prostitution. When she meets a man (Peter Kassovitz) who truly cares for her, Nana's hope returns -- but Raoul (Sady Rebbot), her pimp, may have the final word.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 25m", "director": "Jean-Luc Godard", "studio": "LesFilmsdelaPl\u00e9iade[fr]", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 15, 2020", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Impeccable cinematography by Raoul Coutard. [Full review in Spanish]", "A film of extraordinary purity.", "\"My Life to Live\" has just as much social currency today as the day it was released if its gangster trope ending lets Godard off the hook all too easy.", "At once severe and incandescent, rigorously distanced yet close enough to touch the lenses", "", "To Live Her Life is, to this very early point in his career, Godard's crowning achievement.", "truly exhilarating", "Godard's ode to a hooker remains a bleak, sexy and heartbreaking work of art", "A fine example of Godard's experimental affronts to cinematic conventions, his exploration of the human condition, and his concern for social issues. [Blu-ray]", "contains the best of Godard, both the intellectual and the emotional", "If we were to reduce all of world cinema to just a dozen images, Karina's perfect, pensive face would have to be among them.", "On the one hand it's a provocative portrait of social and sexual politics... on the other a moralistic tale of a shallow, emotionally reckless young woman...", "Godard frames and edits his shots, moves the camera, uses music, and deploys his actors in ways that still seem radical -- even as several generations of directors since have cribbed and stolen from him.", "Godard mixes titles, unusual use of sound, and long scenes of dialog. He is brilliantly served by his wife, Anna Karina, in this film. Karina gives the girl a ring of truth and depth.", "Jean Luc-Godard's third feature fuses trademark stylistic playfulness with a stark portrait of the dehumanising nature of capitalist society.", "Star Anna Karina was in the brutal early rounds of marriage to her director, who was never more doting and egghead-condescending than in this showpiece.", "This 1962 film isn't the most stimulating of Godard's early work, but it does show him beginning to pull away from traditional cutting patterns and sequence arrangement.", "You can see now what Bernard Rose, Mike Figgis, Lars von Trier and all the other DV-fixated filmmakers are striving for; they're trying to reclaim the freedom, the weightlessness, of cinema. Bravo to them.", "Invigorating, revolutionary, joyfully iconoclastic and spontaneous.", "Twelve Brechtian tableaux chronicle the life and death of a whore, starting out as a documentary on prostitution, ending as a Monogram B movie."], "rating": ["", "", "A", "", "4/5", "8", "3.5/4", "A", "4/4", "3.5/4", "1", "", "3.5/4", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "3/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Carlos Bonfil", "Manny Farber", "Cole Smithey", "Fernando F.
