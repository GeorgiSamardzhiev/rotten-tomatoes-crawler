{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Historian and code-breaker Ben Gates (Nicolas Cage) has been searching his whole life for a rumored treasure dating back to the creation of the United States. Joining an expedition led by fellow treasure hunter Ian Howe (Sean Bean), Gates finds an ice-locked Colonial ship in the Arctic Circle that contains a clue linking the treasure to the Declaration of Independence. But when Howe betrays him, Gates has to race to get to the document ahead of his so-called colleague.", "rating": "46", "genre": "Action & Adventure", "runtime": "2h 10m", "director": "Jon Turteltaub", "studio": "DeclarationProductionsInc.,TouchstonePictures,JerryBruckheimerFilms,Junction", "theater_date": "Nov 19, 2004", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$173.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Directed by Jon Turteltaub, National Treasure is nothing but a series of silly stunts and chases that just rush by.", "While not the greatest film of the year, it is definitely one with a considerable amount of intrigue and action, not to mention some actual history lessons...", "It is a definitely guilty pleasure, and 90 percent of the reason why can be summed up in two words: Nicolas Cage.", "National Treasure is certainly no Indiana Jones but it's still fun a ride.", "A serviceable actioner, with a playful comic tone and a series of reasonably thrilling set pieces.", "There might be too many inaccuracies in the plot, the mix of the past and the present is naive and at times downright silly but makes for fun viewing if you don't put your thinking caps on. The film has enough to keep you involved.", "National Treasure is so ridiculous, but I love it. I love it so much.", "The film's infectious enthusiasm for American history-never mind that it's an incredibly fanciful version of that history-is a welcome respite from the hyper-self-conscious civic pride Hollywood usually displays.", "It is ... for all its moments a quintessential Bruckheimer project: a big movie that at its core is just too small.", "Historical adventure is a fun romp for tweens and up.", "Though Turtletaub's direction is inspired, everything else from acting, to plot, and dialogue falls flat...", "", "", "Not only safe for Junior and Grandma but also pretty entertaining.", "", "Turteltaub manages to stitch it all together well enough so that the ludicrous nature of the characters' quest doesn't hit you until the final credits roll.", "If you can see the film through the eyes of a child -- one who thinks a cheesy thriller is the ideal way to pick up new facts about history -- then this isn't that bad a yarn.", "A mild holiday caper, for the wettest of afternoons.", "Has almost nothing to recommend it (Justin Bartha's performance being the lone high point), not even any gnarly explosions, which doesn't bode well for our man Bruckheimer.", "The treasure hunt is cool in this DVD, it's a whole game of numbers and quizzes go get to some of the Easter eggs."], "rating": ["D", "", "3/4", "4/5", "3/5", "2/4", "", "", "", "2/5", "", "2/5", "1/4", "4/5", "4/5", "", "2/4", "", "1/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Micheal Compton", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Matthew Rozsa", "Danielle Solzman", "Miles Fielder", "Namrata Joshi", "Josh Sorokach", "Megan Basham", "Mark Steyn", "Nell Minow", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Gregory Freitas", "Joe Lozito", "Rob Gonsalves", "Jim Lane", "James Mottram", "Peter T.
