{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Chuck (Henry Winkler) has given up life as a stockbroker because it was too stressful. Now, he works an easy gig as a night shift attendant at a New York City morgue. His co-worker, Bill Blazejowski (Michael Keaton), on the other hand, is always looking to make a quick buck. When Bill finds out that Chuck's prostitute neighbor, Belinda (Shelley Long), needs a place to do her work, he convinces Chuck to turn the morgue into a brothel where they can work as her pimps.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Comedy/Documentary/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Ron Howard", "studio": "LaddCompany", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 27, 2013", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Winkler is perfect as the redeemed nerd, and Keaton is a super find, bristling with raw energy.
