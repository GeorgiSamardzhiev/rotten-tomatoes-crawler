The singing is beautiful also. It is a pity the story was not more engaging.", "Storytelling isn't much of a concern for Argento (it rarely is), but his gonzo interests remain flared up, enjoying one last romp armed with a reasonable budget and creative freedom, clearly relishing his time experimenting with operatic extremes.", "Movies like Opera can be treasures for minds inclined to dip further into the shadows. They are reminders that terror begins with uncertainty, not with howls of obvious pain.", "Italian horror master Dario Argento may have the most lopsided strengths and weaknesses of any director I've experienced.", "An art film through and through, though it be an art film with an unusual number of bloody deaths... one of Argento's most memorable films.", "Argento's masterful use of colors and music keep help to keep the film feeling fresh.", "Singing its praises!", "", "", "", "Stylish, but inane and sadistic Argento thriller.", "", "Argento's Opera is a film of rare beauty, a celebration of love's absence and the ferocious force of the gaze."], "rating": ["7/10", "B+", "", "", "3/5", "9/10", "4/5", "6/10", "B", "3.5/4", "6", "8/10", "", "", "3/5", "1/5", "2/5", "3/5", "5/5", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Emma Wolfe", "Brent McKnight", "Anton Bitel", "Rob Aldam", "Niall Browne", "Michael Coldwell", "Heather Wixson", "Mark R.
