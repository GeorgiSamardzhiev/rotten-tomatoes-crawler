{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Stoner Dale Denton's (Seth Rogen) enjoyment of a rare strain of marijuana may prove fatal when he drops his roach in a panic after witnessing a murder.

Don't get me wrong, \"Express\" is still good enough that I left entertained -- just not nearly as much as I hoped I would.", "Cheech and Chong have found new heirs apparent in the form of Saul and Dale, in a film destined to be a new stoner classic.", "I admit I enjoyed Pineapple Express more than I expected.", "This is a baggy, pointless, tiresome film, which is also messy, puerile, cack-handedly gruesome and plain unfunny.", "David Gordon Green seems to have used this template as some sort of experiment... Green's method is like a stone-cold killer in a John Woo movie: He makes us laugh, then immediately shoots us in the face.", "The party got out of hand towards the end, and we probably should have booked out before we got too tired.", "You would have to smoke a great deal of the stuff to make Pineapple Express seem like a good movie, although from the assorted giggles at the Rio Theatre, the audience was ripped and receptive.", "High-ly recommended.", "Your love of it will largely depend on how funny you find a movie with 85 percent of the jokes based on smoking weed. For the rest of you a lot of it is going to feel very silly, crammed with potty humor and overly long for such a simple subject matter.", "Given that cast, crew and audience were and will be baked throughout, Pineapple Express just about earns itself a pass.", "", "", "", "This is possibly the first time a blackened, burnt corpse is played for laughs. It all flows by like so much sugar water.", "In the end, that feel-good factor overrides occasional moments of discomfort.", "The movie runs red with both blood and cherry Slushies ...
