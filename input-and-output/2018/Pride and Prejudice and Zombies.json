{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the 19th century, a mysterious plague turns the English countryside into a war zone. No one is safe as the dead come back to life to terrorize the land.

Elizabeth can't stand Darcy, but respects his skills as a zombie killer.

The Bennett girls have never been more badass.", "The romance is heartless, the plot is brainless, and the action is gutless - Pride and Prejudice and Zombies survives purely on its spine.", "It's silly but also creative and doesn't take itself too seriously.", "An excruciatingly long and tepid 107 minutes, a hollow pastiche of both the costume drama and the zombie movie.", "The inclusion of zombies doesn't make it a kick-ass tale of love and is ultimately a disappointing new take on Jane Austen's novel.", "It's silly and over the top, for sure, but I really, really liked it. Also, even if you've read the book there will still be some surprises!", "There's a balance to be struck between respecting the integrity of Pride and Prejudice while having fun with the wacky experiment of throwing zombies into the mix, and Steers' attempt is decidedly wobbly.", "It's a fun movie that lends a wonderfully weird new energy to a literary classic.", "The many plot strands the script tries to weave together get so horrifically tangled they choke the humor out of any given situation.", "It is sure to be dismissed by some as a high-concept gimmick, but Pride and Prejudice and Zombies manages to deliver on its quirkiness.", "It's a premise that begs for over-the-top antics as Austen's world meets the undead.
