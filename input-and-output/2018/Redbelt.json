{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Martial artist Mike Terry (Chiwetel Ejiofor) lives by a strict code of no competitions, for he feels that such contests weaken fighters. After saving a famous action star (Tim Allen) from a brutal attack, Mike takes a job in the film industry.

The fight is fixed. So is the movie. Deal with it.", "It's a bit disappointing that Redbelt doesn't go much beyond a redux of the same-old.", "", "It's always fun to watch the Mamet stock company springing a trap on an unwary victim.", "What threatened to be David Mamet's most vainglorious misfire since perpetually casting his wife instead turned into samurai noir -an eloquently profane, profanely eloquent eulogy for the purity of martial arts discipline in the face of profit.", "A Kickboxer installment that got too big for its breeches", "Redbelt seems like a rush job that relies too much on the quick fix. I'm very willing to suspend my disbelief, but Redbelt becomes outlandish.", "", "", "", "This Mametian thriller is worth watching for a terrific performance by Chiwetel Ejiofor, but it's hard to engage with the story and it loses its way in the final act.", "", "The detail and clear devotion he has for the sport may actually have the effect of distancing the rest of audience from his film.", "Redbelt, his latest, is a curious one, a movie that hints at greatness only to retreat, unpardonably, into genre convention.", "The Mamet rhythms are pleasingly in place: the repetition-rich dialogue, the head-butting close-ups as men go ego to ego."], "rating": ["4/10", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "2/5", "", "3.5/4", "", "2.5/5", "C", "2.5/5", "B-", "2/5", "2/4", "2/5", "2/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Felicia Feaster", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Kaleem Aftab", "Dan DiNicola", "Brian D.
