{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Natasha (Nadia Bjorlin) is an aspiring singer and an ace driver. She gets a gig illegally racing flashy sports cars for wealthy music producer Infamous (Eddie Griffin), who, with his millionaire friends Jerry (Tim Matheson) and Michael (Angus Macfadyen), bets big money on street races. But the already dangerous contests spiral out of control when the conniving Michael decides to do whatever it takes to get Natasha racing for him instead of for Infamous -- even if that means kidnapping her.", "rating": "0", "genre": "Action & Adventure", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Andy Cheng", "studio": "ChicagoPictures", "theater_date": "Apr 13, 2007", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$6.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Redline threatens to be so bad that it's good.
