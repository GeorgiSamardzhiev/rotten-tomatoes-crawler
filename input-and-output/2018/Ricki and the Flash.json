{"metadata": {"synopsis": "It's been a roller-coaster ride for Ricki Rendazzo (Meryl Streep), a one-time wife and mother of three who left her family behind to follow her dreams of rock 'n' roll stardom in California. Now, the singer and guitarist must face the music when she returns home to Indiana to reconnect with ex-husband Pete (Kevin Kline), troubled daughter Julie, engaged son Josh and younger son Adam. Filled with regret, Ricki hopes to find redemption for all of the bad choices that she made in the past.", "rating": "65", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Jonathan Demme", "studio": "ClinicaEstetico,LStarCapital,TriStarPictures", "theater_date": "Aug 7, 2015", "dvd_date": "Nov 4, 2016", "box_office": "$26.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["[Ricki And The Flash] carries a maturity that her earlier films lacked... Despite that, the movie ends in a syrupy sweet reconciliation.", "The truth is that there are a handful of performers who make nearly everything they do better. Streep is one of these performers.", "I felt like it was 20 minutes too long.", "I liked it. I didn't hate this movie... I was passively watching it.", "It's a mediocre melody made infinitely better by those that playing it.", "A predictable film, topical, without big surprises, that walks on paths more than explored, and that barely reminds Jonathan Demme's style. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Ricki managed to get under my skin through the course of her story, and I left the cinema feeling nourished, my heart warmed and a smile on my face.", "In the end, the film insists that there's no contradiction between domesticity and biker jackets. As a mom, Ricki rocks.", "The film is a good effort from Diablo Cody, but ultimately Ricki and the Flash is just a feel good film.", "The combination of fantastic music, good performances, and the slightly dark undertones covered up by a feel-goodness the movie has in the end, makes for a fun watch regardless of any issues it might have.", "This is where Diablo Cody shines in writing complex characters that you both despise and root for at the same time.", "Demme plods through the familial tangles, but he tears through the music scenes with real verve. The film comes alive when Ricki is onstage; it's throwback barroom rock, euphorically delivered.", "Cody's script tries to juggle too many themes and ideas, abandoning a lot of them on the way.", "It's not a film to write home about, but its honesty - albeit something hard to watch - is admirable.", "This one will be a deep cut [Meryl]Streep fans will relish.", "Skip this one and save your money.", "With Meryl at the center, Ricki's less than crowd-pleasing moments are fairly easy to overlook.", "None of this really hangs together. It is almost horrifying to watch someone as statuesque and strident as Streep cringing and mugging her way through a role this pathetic.", "It does possess the typical &#8232;energy of a Demme film, but everything connecting the &#8232;musical numbers is forced and &#8232;superficial.", "The mighty Meryl is supported by a fine cast (most of whom are onscreen less than they deserve to be). But, despite some resonant moments Ricki and the Flash suffers from scenes that belie believability."], "rating": ["", "2.5/4", "", "", "C+", "", "3.5/5", "", "3.5/5", "3.5/5", "B-", "3/5", "6.5/10", "", "B", "0.5/4", "", "3/5", "", "6.5/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Catherine Eaton", "Richard Propes", "Andrew Galdi", "Avaryl Halley", "Leslie Combemale", "Alberto Abu\u00edn", "Kate Rodger", "Noah Berlatsky", "Brigid Presecky", "Mae Abdulbaki", "Rachel Wagner", "Craig Williams", "Bernard Boo", "Amanda Greever", "James Clay", "Pamela Powell", "Bobby Finger", "Camilla Long", "Uri Klein", "Alexandra MacAaron"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bitch Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Siren", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newshub (NZ)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Quartz", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">FF2 Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies with Mae", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Way Too Indie", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Daily Times (Tennessee)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fresh Fiction", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Journal (Kankakee, IL)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Muse/Jezebel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sunday Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Haaretz", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Women&#39;s Voices for Change"], "date": ["February 9, 2021", "September 21, 2020", "April 29, 2020", "April 29, 2020", "October 16, 2019", "August 30, 2019", "August 29, 2019", "August 29, 2019", "August 14, 2019", "May 2, 2019", "April 19, 2019", "April 6, 2019", "March 7, 2019", "January 10, 2019", "December 14, 2018", "August 21, 2018", "June 13, 2018", "February 21, 2018", "January 11, 2018", "December 3, 2017"]}}
