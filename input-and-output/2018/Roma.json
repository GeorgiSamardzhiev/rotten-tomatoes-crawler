Quietly spectacular, this larger format, digitally shot film needs to be seen on the big screen.", "I'm sad to say that I didn't love it as I wanted to. But I do admire it completely.", "This is a movie from the point of view of the housekeeper, usually a secondary character that doesn't have a voice [Full Review in Spanish]", "[Yalitza] Aparicio's work is of staggering power.", "The subjects are incredibly un-cinematic, as his camera documents - in a somewhat documentarian style - the lives and lifestyles of painfully average people.", "Aesthetically, the film is gorgeous. Cuaron has an attention for detail that other filmmakers should study.", "Transcendent.", "Perhaps the true mastery of the film is that it never actually feels like a masterpiece.", "Cuar\u00f3n's work as a writer, director and cinematographer are beyond perfection. His use of chaos to create the ordinary are the work of a genius. [Full review in Spanish]", "A slow-burn film that recalls the Italian Neorealist movement. The goal is a slice-of-life character study rather than plot twists, but if you flip your mental switch, it's a subtly enveloping film that elicits nostalgia.", "The result is the most novelistic and experiential offering yet for [Cuar\u00f3n], but make no mistake: Roma is not a film of gimmicks.", "Cuar\u00f3n has a crafted something that is purely, assuredly human.", "It doesn't happen often, but sometimes as a film critic you exit a film so extraordinary and emotionally stirring that words nearly fail you. Writer/director/cinematographer/co-editor Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n's deeply personal work Roma is just such an experience.", "Each moment, each dialogue build toward something very special, and then, the movie takes your head, looks you in the eyes and inspects your soul. [Full review in Spanish]", "Gorgeous and formally flawless, the director's precision and meticulous craft is unmatched, and his deep, personal connection to the story readily shines through. Roma is all of these things, but it also left me absolutely cold.", "It's a beautiful, emotional, human film, without music, which recreates an era with great aesthetic meticulousness and dissects the inequalities between social classes in a particular period of Mexican sociopolitical history. [Full review in Spanish]", "In Cuar\u00f3n's films, cinema conjures up its own world, and this one provides the chance to explore it with him more intimately than ever before.", "The movie's distance here works against it, emphasizing its outsider's view of what it frames as lower-class concerns. Instead of lending her character dimensionality, Cleo's tribulations begin to feel cartoonishly grim.", "Roma is intimate, epic and female-focused, not unlike filmmaker Alfonso Cuaron's 2013 intergalactic 3-D odyssey Gravity... But Roma is also an immersive nostalgic valentine to his '70s childhood in Mexico City.", "Fundamentally, it's a character piece about Chloe. Aparicio's placid, yet expressive face sometimes recalls Ren\u00e9e Falconetti in The Passion of Joan of Arc.
