{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After newspaper reporter Cindy (Anna Faris) accidentally watches a strange videotape that causes the viewer to die within a week, she discovers the tape is only one of many weird happenings.

Cindy finds a link between the tape and the crop circles with help from the U.S. president (Leslie Nielsen) and a kindly aunt (Queen Latifah).", "rating": "35", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 20m", "director": "David Zucker", "studio": "Miramax,BradGreyProductions,DimensionFilms", "theater_date": "Oct 24, 2003", "dvd_date": "Oct 8, 2016", "box_office": "$110.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The first one was original, the second was still funny, but the third installment is on autopilot.", "Scary Movie 3 is even funnier than the first two.", "This PG-13 has R-rated stuff.", "It's better than the second film...", "Be afraid, be very afraid.", "Just middling funny, with no truly memorable high points and a sum impact that goes poof! before you've left the parking garage.", "Basically, any movie that suffers from a lack of Charlie Sheen has got problems.", "Zucker's slapstick may have the satiric delicacy of a chainsaw lobotomy, but it hasn't harmed the franchise.", "As with Scary Movie parts one and two, you pays your money, you gets your laughs, and you won't remember a thing in a few months.", "Fun, stupid stuff with no sense of a narrative arc or plot structure ... but hey, it made me laugh anyway.", "This is just a stab in the dark, the wildest of guesses on my part, but I don't think Michael Jackson would recommend \"Scary Movie 3.\"", "", "If you're looking for anything other than a parody clipshow, you won't find it.", "Scary Movie 3 turns out to be an odd combination of the old-fashioned and the hip.
