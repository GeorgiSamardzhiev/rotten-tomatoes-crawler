{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When retiring police Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman) tackles a final case with the aid of newly transferred David Mills (Brad Pitt), they discover a number of elaborate and grizzly murders. They soon realize they are dealing with a serial killer (Kevin Spacey) who is targeting people he thinks represent one of the seven deadly sins. Somerset also befriends Mills' wife, Tracy (Gwyneth Paltrow), who is pregnant and afraid to raise her child in the crime-riddled city.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 5m", "director": "David Fincher", "studio": "NewLineCinema", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 6, 2010", "box_office": "$100.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The structure of the narrative is dense but its beats are deliberate, making for a viewing experience that's hypnotic on first viewing and only deepens on subsequent watches.", "This is classic stuff for Fincher, where the egoism of a fictional character is laced not only through great works of art and literature, but through religion.", "The perfect twisted thriller!", "The seriousness is great, the comic relief sparse, and the tension high, aided nicely by Howard Shore's nerve-wracking score and a maniacal opening title sequence.", "Fincher's stylish filmmaking elevated each scene in such a way that the movie never felt exploitative in spite of the horrific plotlines.", "With every murder more sordid than the previous one, nothing prepares them - or us - for the heart-pulsating shocker at the end, when the contents of that box made John Doe into one of the most notorious on-screen villains", "Worth seeing if you can look past the gruesome details.", "The stormy, sooty, blackened unnamed city in David Fincher's murder mystery feels a little like hell-infested with cretins, sinners, and pretty boys with a death wish-and that sure makes me think Se7en is one of the foremost horror movies of modern times.", "It's about magnitudes of corruptibility and fallibility, how we all fall prey to them and yet, so we hope, press on. Watching as a teenager in 1995, I felt the fear of what could test me. Today, I watch and fear that I've not yet really been tested.", "For nearly every movie about a sadistic criminal that would come after, some part of us recalls the words of Detective Somerset, who may be one of the first men in mainstream cinema that dares to ask why we easily dismiss serial killers as lunatics.", "Cria um mundo opressivo, cinza e angustiante que parece determinado a constantemente lembrar seus ocupantes de que a vida \u00e9 cruel, injusta e sem sentido.", "After 20 years and countless copycats, hasn't lost any of its unnerving, devastating nihilistic power.", "Although the story isn't original, it's powerfully directed by David Fincher, and Morgan Freeman gives another of his superbly understated performances.", "Unfortunately, most of the scenes in Seven are unlikely, which means that by the end of the movie the duo is battling not just an insane killer but an off-the-wall screenwriter.", "There's none of the humor that takes the sting out of slasher movies, and certainly none of the psychology and depth that made The Silence of the Lambs such an intellectual thriller.", "Were it not for the gravity and thoughtfulness of Morgan Freeman's performance as a retiring policeman, and the third-act appearance of its bizarre villain, Seven would be unendurable.", "The two actors misfire here: Freeman is so low-key he's almost drowsy, and Pitt jumps around like a chihuahua to no effect. It doesn't help that the sound mix is so murky that much of their dialogue sinks into the murk.", "The reason to see Seven, which is decidedly not for the faint of stomach, is not for the punishment of sin, but the many virtues of Freeman's contribution.", "The investigation and the clues that lead to the murderer are well thought out and continually provocative. As a narrative, the film is quite involving.", "Seven is a work of extraordinary style, upsetting power and narrative daring."], "rating": ["9/10", "", "1", "9/10", "5/5", "", "3/4", "", "5/5", "4/4", "5/5", "9/10", "3/4", "2.5/4", "1/4", "2/4", "", "2.5/4", "2.5/4", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Sean Collier", "Soham Gadre", "Marianna Neal", "Mike Massie", "Sez\u00edn Koehler", "C.J.
