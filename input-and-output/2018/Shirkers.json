The 16 mm film is recovered 20 years later, sending Tan, who is now a novelist living in Los Angeles, on a personal odyssey in search of Georges' footprints.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Documentary", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "Sandi Tan", "studio": "", "theater_date": "Oct 26, 2018", "dvd_date": "Oct 26, 2018", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Independent filmmaking is truly a medium of self expression but because it's a communal medium, being an asshole is an absolute necessity- it's a very narcissistic endeavor. Shirkers is a very entertaining, touching concoction film about filmmaking.", "Shirkers forces us to confront a world that will never give us all the answers.", "Documentary filmmaker Sandi Tan turned the camera on herself in this remarkable documentary about a movie she made in Singapore as a teenager, which was then stolen by someone else.", "Alas, Shirkers the narrative feature wasn't to be ... But that's okay: Shirkers the documentary is already full of creative magic.", "An irresistible mix of insouciance and precocious maturity. Much of its charm lies in Tan's ironic irreverence as the film's narrator.", "Sandi Tan directs a documentary that functions in two levels, one as a self-portrait and one as a mystery story regarding the disappearance and the rediscovery of the film. The great thing about \"Shirkers\" is that both aspects work extremely well,", "The fact that everyone knows each other quite well, there is no holding back which gives the film and the story overall an extra added layer of truth despite the main mystery never being told, only speculation is left.", "A quietly radical act of self-love and catharsis - an exorcism of childhood demons that is at once joyful and haunted.", "In this sincere, engrossing documentary, director Sandi Tan looks back a quarter of a century at Shirkers, a quirky indie film she helped make that captured a mostly bygone Singapore.", "The film is pervaded by an alternately whimsical and agonizing sense of mystery, one steeped in contradictions of accomplishment and missed opportunity.", "This documentary is about all the effort that went into making a film in 1992, as well as detective work to track down a mysterious hustler who manipulated the filmmakers, and who sabotaged that 1992 Singapore film, 'Shirkers.'", "A riot of movie clips... gives the narrative a riveting pace that sparks intense curiosity about even the quirkiest details.", "The visual style of this eclectic documentary is intense and necessary. [Full review in Spanish]", "A mysterious and frequently wonderful documentary.", "...offers insights into Singaporean culture, the visual imagination of a young filmmaker, and the questionable behavior one a very strange professor.", "What Tan has given us is an incredible, sui generis tribute to the international lingua franca of D.I.Y. cinempowerment.", "It is rare that an artist allows themselves such a public interrogation of failure.", "Like an essayistic mystery story told in the form of a prodigiously cinematic 16mm inflected punk zine, Shirkers is nothing short of remarkable nonfiction cinema.", "It's a charming, wistful movie, and I trust Tan will not have to wait another 20 years to direct her next film.", "The stuff about Cardona is obviously the draw [but seeing its] potential historical importance in hindsight is to weep for those never-made works it wasn't here to inspire."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "5/5", "", "B", "4/5", "", "4/5", "8/10", "4/5", "A-", "", "B+", "8/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Dustin Chang", "Fletcher Powell", "Film Companion Staff", "CJ Sheu", "Ela Bittencourt", "Panos Kotzathanasis", "Katie Hogan", "Matthew Lucas", "Phil Guie", "Jon Dieringer", "Robert Roten", "Rich Cline", "Ruben Peralta Rigaud", "Tom Augustine", "Sarah Boslaugh", "David Fear", "Glenn Dunks", "Jordan M.
