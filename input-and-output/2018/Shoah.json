{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Director Claude Lanzmann spent 11 years on this sprawling documentary about the Holocaust, conducting his own interviews and refusing to use a single frame of archival footage. Dividing Holocaust witnesses into three categories -- survivors, bystanders and perpetrators -- Lanzmann presents testimonies from survivors of the Chelmno concentration camp, an Auschwitz escapee and witnesses of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising, as well as a chilling report of gas chambers from an SS officer at Treblinka.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Art House & International/Documentary/Special Interest", "runtime": "9h 21m", "director": "Claude Lanzmann", "studio": "", "theater_date": "Oct 23, 1985", "dvd_date": "Apr 1, 2014", "box_office": "$15.6K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Words can not do justice to the elegance, the importance, nor the tragedy that Lanzmann's nine hour opus encompasses. Though an overwhelming undertaking, Shoah is absolutely essential viewing.", "If one can stomach 9 hours of hell, Shoah is a masterpiece.", "When we identify with victims, we believe we see ourselves, but perhaps we are simply looking away.", "No other film that I have seen about the subject has haunted me as Shoah does: images and voices returning, un-asked and, so to speak, unwanted, when I wake in the night or as I play in the park with my baby son.", "Its riveting nine hours are perhaps the most important piece of historical cinema we possess.", "With his 9 1/2-hour Shoah, Claude Lanzmann has accomplished the seemingly impossible: He has brought such beauty to his recounting of the horror of the Holocaust that he has made it accessible and comprehensible.", "By straightforwardly presenting interviews with people who lived through the Holocaust, Lanzmann makes it real again. Even more impressively, he helps us to see how the horror could have happened.", "Lanzmann`s monumental film bears significant witness to the Holocaust. Those who see it will never forget it.", "Shoah is the greatest use of film in motion picture history, taking movies to their highest moral value. For what director/interviewer Lanzmann has done on film is nothing less than revive history, a history so ugly that many would prefer to forget.", "Putting a face on inhuman misery, this remarkable achievement demonstrates film's unique power and its underperformed duty.", "a magnificently disquieting experience--a harrowing descent into the depths of humanity's potential for unmitigated brutality, cruelty, and evil.", "[It] has transcended the cinema to become a primary record of the extermination of European Jews during the Second World War.", "It's brilliantly conceived; it's intolerable. It is the indispensable film of any year when it appears.", "Why revisit \"Shoah'' 25 years after it was first released? Because it matters more a quarter century on, just as it will matter even more in a hundred years, and 200, and - if it and we survive - a thousand.", "the film's achievement is to show there are stories worth hearing, and ravaged, resilient faces that reward our scrutiny. The horror, the gallows humor, the shame and the heroism, the lessons of this holocaust -- and all others--have not been exhausted.", "To see these places and events described by the voices and faces of those who lived through them is immensely important.", "At a time when the few remaining witnesses to the Holocaust are passing away, Shoah more than ever stands as a necessary experience.", "takes to task largely accepted concepts of what is known, what can be imagined, and how people relate to Hitler's mass extermination with an unrivaled formal insight.", "Lanzmann slowly, cumulatively colors in a vast canvas on mass murder.", "Viewing \"Shoah\" today proves that the Holocaust is not a discrete event, but rather an ongoing public narrative in which the movie continues to play a crucial part."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "4/4", "", "4/4", "5/5", "4/4", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "3.5/4", "A", "5/5", "5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jordan M.
