{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Charlie (Charles Aznavour) is a former classical pianist who has changed his name and now plays jazz in a grimy Paris bar. When Charlie's brothers, Richard (Jean-Jacques Aslanian) and Chico (Albert Remy), surface and ask for Charlie's help while on the run from gangsters they have scammed, he aids their escape. Soon Charlie and Lena (Marie Dubois), a waitress at the same bar, face trouble when the gangsters (Claude Mansard, Daniel Boulanger) arrive, looking for his brothers.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama/Mystery & Suspense/Romance", "runtime": "1h 25m", "director": "Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut", "studio": "LesFilmsdelaPl\u00e9iade[fr]", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 11, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A melodrama of low entertainment value.", "It is all brilliant and heartless.", "It's an exciting film, a film in which you feel the director in every moment, in the jerky, jazzy, throwaway style and the tough, semi-private language, and in the particular brand of sharp good humour, off-savoury rather than exactly 'bitter.", "Made with enthusiasm and audacity, it still seems fresh.", "A superb combination of genre movie and Truffaut's special brand of perfectly observed, humanist detail.", "The film allowed Truffaut to express his love of American hardboiled fiction and classic Hollywood cinema in all its romantic glory.", "Often overlooked, Truffaut's wonderful second film stars Charles Aznavour, master of the chanson, in his only collaboration with the director.", "A distinctively postwar Parisian creation, coldblooded and sentimental and wounded and whimsical, all at the same time.", "One of those rare movies that you're sorry to see end.", "Truffaut leaves too much that is not clear as he concentrates on individual scenes.", "It's my favorite Truffaut film, not because it's the best but because it's the most enjoyable.", "Universally considered a masterpiece of the film noir genre.", "The determined jollity of Georges Delerue's saloon piano score, which later opens up to encompass a wide world of romanticism, sets the tone for Francois Truffaut's audacious second feature, made in 1960.", "Truffaut's form of self-reflection is ultimately a way of playing the audience.", "A landmark film that took the world three decades to accept", "", "A film that holds together even though its constituent parts would seem to clash to the point of canceling each other out.", "The story is by turns comic and pathetic, often flashing midstream from one mood to the other, and Aznavour's performance as the wounded hero is a masterstroke of casting.", "", "An affectionate tribute to the low-budget crime movies that Truffaut so loved, and it's one of my favorite Truffaut films."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "5/5", "", "4.5/5", "", "A-", "", "4/4", "", "B+", "4/5", "4/5", "", "5/5", "4/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["P.S.
