After intensive study, his students ace California's calculus test, only to learn that their scores are being questioned. They'll have to retake the exam in order to quiet the critics.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez", "studio": "WarnerBrothers", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 1, 2008", "box_office": "$11.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["You could remain, mesmerized, in Jaime Escalante's high-school math class forever, the way you remain under the spell of Escalante himself as \"Stand and Deliver\" unfolds.", "Olmos provides plenty to stand up and cheer about even when the film is not delivering much else in the way of substance.", "An unexpected triumph.", "A pretty good TV movie, smoothly directed by Cuban-born Ramon Menendez, a graduate of UCLA film school, and blessed with a charismatic lead performance by Edward James Olmos.", "As the tough math teacher, Olmos delivers a strong, Oscar-nominated performance in this rather simple but uplifting melodrama.", "Intensely watchable movie based on a true story.", "It's hard to believe this really happened, but Escalante is apparently still performing the same miracle. The ensemble acting is excellent.", "", "\"The greatest John G. Avildsen movie John G. Avidlsen never made.
