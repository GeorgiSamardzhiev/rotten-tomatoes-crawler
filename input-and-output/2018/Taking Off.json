{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Director Milos Foreman made his American debut with this comedy about 1960s-style parenting. Jeannie Tyne (Linnea Heacock) has fled her parents and her suburban home to wander around New York City. Sick with worry, Jeannie's mom, Lynn (Lynn Carlin), and dad, Larry (Buck Henry), meet other parents of runaways in a support group. When Jeannie finally returns home, however, it appears that her parents have been having quite a bit of fun with their new friends in her absence.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Milos Forman", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "Mar 28, 1971", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Forman's, in short, is a talent in a thousand.", "Forman plays on this conflict of styles, catching at all the pedantic nuances of American jargon and pop culture to create a universally recognisable image of man's unfounded optimism.", "Mr. Forman has made a comedy in the United States; and he has shown that his gift works on either side of the Atlantic.", "Forman has been superbly served by a largely unfamiliar cast.", "Czech director Milos Forman applies subtle European sensibility to his American directing debut, a bittersweet satire of family mores and manners in times of change.", "", "Foreman's particular ability is to make the ordinary look interesting.
