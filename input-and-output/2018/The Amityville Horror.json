{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Chiller about a family who is terrorized by supernatural forces when they move into a new house in New York State which was the scene of a recent mass killing and the home of an 18th-century satanist.

[Full Review in Spanish]", "A chilling horror wrapped up in a disturbing family drama, in spite of its dubious true crime roots.", "[The Amityville Horror] begins with the promising premise of a haunted house in the suburbs (poltergeists in the barbecue pit?) and quickly degenerates into a display of pretentious camera angles.", "The family sticks around to sample the entire range of demon poltergeist effects, while Rod Steiger, a priest who tries to help, is laid up in bed, perhaps due to a chronic case of overacting.", "Although bafflingly a box-office hit, director Stuart Rosenberg's tepid chiller never matches the flesh-crawling terror contained in Anson's book.", "The film's reputation exceeds its achievements, and the \"true story\" angle has been vigorously disputed.", "A scary movie that does not frighten or surprise you is as bad as a comedy that is not funny, and there's nothing here to have even the most mousish ducking under covers.", "[A] goose-pimply haunted house yarn.", "The Amityville Horror is just another indication that the trail left by The Exorcist has now become too faint to be worth following.", "The Amityville Horror is a horror. What is supposed to be the true story of a young couple driven from their dream house by demons turns out to be nothing more than a rip-off, and a tedious one at that.", "Overall, The Amityville Horror will undoubtedly convince audiences that something did happen in Amityville -- but will leave them wondering what the big fuss was all about.", "Brolin and Kidder carry the film, their conviction encouraging you to believe even if you don't.", "'70s horror movie hasn't aged well; violence and peril.", "It has scattered moments all throughout that acquit themselves well as, if not top-shelf horror, then at least second-from-the-top.", "Its pacing is off, there are too many go-nowhere subplots, & it seems just to come to a clunking halt at the end [but] the film's lack of commitment to any single reading of its narrative architecture is precisely what makes it so uncanny.", "A pack of flies swarm all over Father Delaney -- then again, given Rod Steiger's howling performance as the priest, it could just be that the flies like reeking ham.", "It was popular at the box-office, but was unremarkable as a horror film", "An astonishing number of fumbled frissons", "It's definitely a house that audiences will enjoy visiting, especially if unfamiliar with the ending."], "rating": ["", "", "4/5", "", "", "2/5", "2/5", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "7/10", "2/5", "3/5", "", "1.5/4", "C", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Eve Tushnet", "Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos", "C.H.
