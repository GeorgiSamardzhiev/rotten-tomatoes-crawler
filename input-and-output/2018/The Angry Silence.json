His life is changed when he refuses to take part in an unofficial strike, organized by new employee Travers (Alfred Burke), a troublemaker who soon leaves the factory. Curtis sees no reason to strike, but his refusal alienates him from the rest of the unionized employees, who brand him a scab. Curtis even faces reprisals at home when a foreman (Bernard Lee) comes and warns him to fall in line.", "rating": "80", "genre": "Art House & International/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Guy Green", "studio": "BeaverFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Sep 23, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The industrial tensions that were lampooned in I'm All Right, Jack are treated with gravity and passion in a British drama starring Richard Attenborough...", "In many ways the factory world isn't unlike school: there is the same sort of gang-life, close proximity, and prefectorial system; above all a similar attitude to authority and a similar hatred for anyone who appears to be on its side.", "The film has several themes whose admixture and thorough working out, possible in a novel, are less ideally suited to the cinema.
