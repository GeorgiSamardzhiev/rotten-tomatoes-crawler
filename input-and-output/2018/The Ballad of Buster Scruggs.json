There's way too much singing, an excess of goofiness that doesn't stick.", "If you enjoyed No Country for Old Men, O, Brother Where Art Thou? or True Grit, this is a welcome return for the Coens to the western genre.", "The whole shebang is expertly put together and viewers are guaranteed plenty of darkly comic fun and one or two wistful moments, too.", "\"The Ballad of Buster Scruggs\" is deliciously misanthropic, despite the Coen Brothers' protesting otherwise.", "The Coen Brothers make the genre transitions seem easy. There is a little of everything we love about them in this unique piece. [Full review in Spanish]", "Individual segments succeed as scaffolding to an overarching thematic arc or as a stand-alone narrative piece, but rarely both at once.", "A strangely moving exercise in looking at mortality in ways we don't often do so. The Coens still know how to surprise us with both their writing and their philosophy.", "I feel the most hackneyed artificiality when it resorts to the audiovisual rhetoric that is characteristic of the directors' aesthetics to honor stereotypes of a Wild West. [Full review in Spanish]", "As with the Coens' oeuvre on the whole, the various stories are unified by an impressive sense of craft and a lamentable sense of smugness.", "Whether you like the Coen brothers or not, of if you really love Westerns or not, there is a story in this anthology film to be appreciated and enjoyed by anyone who's looking for something unusual, or just a really great story.", "On an artistic level, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is an unreserved success.", "Combining their trademark wit with comedic violence and tense drama, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs is a delightful return to form for the Coens.", "In a world where the reality of death is increasingly avoided or hidden from view, [Buster Scruggs is] oddly sobering. Remembering death matters.", "Many of us god-fearing reg'lar folk expect a twist at the closing of a short story, but life ain't like that on the frontiers of the Coen brothers' imagination, no sirree.", "The inspired moments in Buster Scruggs and the thought provoking arcs in the proceedings are testament to the Coen brothers' filmmaking talent.", "Tonal ups and downs aside, Buster Scruggs is an unsettling film, not least because the characters in it are themselves unsettled... all of them are caught up in some kind of relentless, repetitive journey."], "rating": ["", "", "A-", "4/10", "", "", "4/5", "4/4", "9/10", "3/5", "3.5/4", "5/10", "", "4/5", "", "3/5", "", "", "3.5/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Fletcher Powell", "Jesse Hassenger", "Mike Massie", "Dan Buffa", "Paul McGuire Grimes", "Jason Best", "Matthew Rozsa", "Victor Pineyro", "Matt Cipolla", "Steven Prokopy", "Yasser Medina", "Ben Sachs", "Katie Hogan", "Chris McCoy", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Brett McCracken", "Richard Trenholm", "Sameen Amer", "Keva York"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KMUW - Wichita Public Radio", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Nylon", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KSDK News (St. Louis)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KSTP-TV (St. Paul, MN)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Talk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">matthewrozsa.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seventh Art Studio", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Monthly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Third Coast Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">VultureHound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flick Feast", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Gospel Coalition", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNET", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The News International (Pakistan)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ABC News (Australia)"], "date": ["February 11, 2021", "February 9, 2021", "February 4, 2021", "December 5, 2020", "November 10, 2020", "November 4, 2020", "October 19, 2020", "September 22, 2020", "August 30, 2020", "July 25, 2020", "July 1, 2020", "June 27, 2020", "February 24, 2020", "February 3, 2020", "January 21, 2020", "November 8, 2019", "August 19, 2019", "April 16, 2019", "April 11, 2019", "March 15, 2019"]}}
