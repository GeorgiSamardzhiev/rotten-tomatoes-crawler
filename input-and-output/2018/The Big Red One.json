{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Having previously fought in World War I, an unnamed sergeant (Lee Marvin) now leads soldiers of the U.S. First Infantry Division through World War II. His men include conflicted marksman Pvt. Griff (Mark Hamill), pulp novel writer Pvt. Zab (Robert Carradine), Sicilian Pvt. Vinci (Bobby Di Cicco) and medic Pvt. Johnson (Kelly Ward). The soldiers adapt to the hardships of war as they see conflict in North Africa and Sicily, take part in the D-Day landings, and liberate a Nazi concentration camp.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Samuel Fuller", "studio": "LorimarProductions,UnitedArtists", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 27, 2013", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's an adventure film as refreshing in content and style as The Deer Hunter was horrifyingly realistic and Apocalypse Now was terrifyingly philosophical.", "But in the end, for a film that pretends to be anti-war, it comes across as ambiguous, which isn't anything new in the work of Samuel Fuller. [Full Review in Spanish]", "... if you want a World War II story from a real vet's perspective, Sam Fuller is still the man and The Big Red One, drawn from his own war experiences, is the film", "It's a terrific war yarn, a picture of palpable raw power which manages both Intense intimacy and great scope at the same time.", "Personal observation bleeds out of every scene, and somehow it feels like a true story in a way that most war movies can't achieve.", "", "... displays both raw power and the hint of war's brutality.", "Visually and philosophically, it's Fuller's equivalent of Kurosawa's Kagemusha, although Fuller's film is more complex, more absurd and more haunted.", "", "Although these are the stock characters of war drama - the sage, grizzled Sarge, the farm boy, the street kid, the nice guy who doesn't want to kill anyone and the witness - Fuller's are particularly credible ordinary people.", "meant to be the culmination of a life's work... It didn't come to pass.", "The cast smartly underplays things, with Marvin being as charismatic as usual playing a man of few words. And Hamill, an actor given to over-the-top outbursts, reins it in here; this may be his best big-screen performance.", "These places were where Fuller himself served during the war, and he imbues these stories with the same gritty detail he probably delivered telling them over a beer.", "", "Schickel's painstaking work elevates The Big Red One into the pantheon of the all-time great war films and gives it a fullness that the original only suggested.", "Fuller went a step further, baring not only his soul but the wartime scars inflicted upon it. For all its merits, the 1980 version of the film denied audiences that connection. The new version both restores and reaffirms it.", "Fuller wrote and directed The Big Red One with a reporter's respect for detail and a humanist's respect for the moments that shape lives.", "'The Reconstruction,' which clocks in at 2 hours, 43 minutes, with not a single extraneous frame, elevates the work from a robust genre film to a full-blown epic.", "To see this seamless 'reconstruction' -- consisting of some 15 entirely new sequences as well as augmentations to 23 others -- is to behold a masterpiece revealed.", ""], "rating": ["3.5/4", "", "", "", "9/10", "4/5", "B", "", "4/5", "5/5", "3/5", "3/4", "4/4", "4/5", "4/4", "4/5", "3.5/4", "5/5", "", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Larry Vitacco", "Jes\u00fas Fern\u00e1ndez Santos", "Sean Axmaker", "Variety Staff", "Tim Brayton", "Cole Smithey", "Dennis Schwartz", "", "Emanuel Levy", "Angie Errigo", "Chris Barsanti", "Jeff Vice", "Sean P.
