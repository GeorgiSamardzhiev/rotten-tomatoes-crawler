Well, never mind that. I like Malden and Franciscus and it's fun watching them fight for justice in an Italian murder mystery.", "The film's 9 disparate leads will eventually be synthesised, but on the way there are a lot of blind alleys, false trails & red herrings, as much obscuring as revealing the solution in a manner that recalls the parable of the blind men & an elephant.", "For all of Argento's virtuosity, he's no master of suspense or even tension. He's a showman and a stylist and his set pieces are pulp art pieces...", "A tall and slimmer Karl Malden stands out, but even with a rooftop chase, the conclusion and revelation are abrupt.", "", "if it is Argento's weakest early effort, it is only because he was still trying to find his voice, experimenting with different techniques and gradually learning just how far he could push the envelope.", "Uncanny", "Italian 'giallo' thriller by horrormeister Dario Argento.", "Dario Argento giallo is the cat's meow.", "", "...highly unlikely to appeal to anyone other than the most ardent Argento fan, and even those folks will be hard-pressed to find anything here worth embracing.", "", "", "", "", "Moderately effective, stylish early giallo from Argento"], "rating": ["3.0/4", "", "3/4", "7/10", "C+", "", "", "", "B-", "2.5/4", "", "3/5", "", "3/5", "1/4", "3/5", "8", "2/5", "3/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Randall King", "Matt Brunson", "Michael Coldwell", "Paul Chambers", "Anton Bitel", "Sean Axmaker", "Donald J.
