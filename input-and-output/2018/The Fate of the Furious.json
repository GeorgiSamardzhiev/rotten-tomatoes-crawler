It's clever on the humour and the action whilst keeping within the film's emotional core. At the end of the day, it's about family.", "The film doesn't disappoint in its over-dramatized races, unimaginable stunts and adrenaline filled scenes. But as the stunts get bigger the plot gets smaller.", "Moments that should've been emotional, are quickly forgotten thanks to Vin Diesel's robotic acting. [Full review in Spanish]", "Vapid fun, which is fine, but something of a disappointment now that we've seen how much more these movies can be.", "So for all its talk of family and redemption, there's surprising little emotional weight to this chapter.", "The quality of these films has enhanced over the years; you know what you're in for when you buy a ticket, which is typically an enjoyable ride.", "This new joint is dark, no-nonsense and butt-kicking - thanks mainly to Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, Vin Diesel and Jason Statham.", "There are raining cars, high-speed chases and spectacular stunts throughout, which both border on the ridiculously crazy to the incredibly entertaining, delivering the stuff the fans want and enjoy immensely.", "F8 benefits from the considerable muscle of the top actors in the action field.", "Despite how over-the-top all the action scenes are, Roman earned nothing but eye-rolls from me, and while we can argue that each character deserves their moment to shine, I am of a mind that these characters are expendable.", "Somebody is going to have to write something better for these folks who go driving in their fast cars and obsess about the priceless nature of family.", "This film has enough action shot hand held to keep you ducking in your seat, and enough cars being destroyed and fire to keep the sizzle going.", "The way in which all its vanishing points converge and fit, give relevance and weight to the fantastic climax.
