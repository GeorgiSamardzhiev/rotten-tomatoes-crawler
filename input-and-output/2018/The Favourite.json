{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the early 18th century, England is at war with the French. Nevertheless, duck racing and pineapple eating are thriving. A frail Queen Anne occupies the throne, and her close friend Lady Sarah governs the country in her stead while tending to Anne's ill health and mercurial temper. When a new servant, Abigail, arrives, her charm endears her to Sarah. Sarah takes Abigail under her wing, and Abigail sees a chance to return to her aristocratic roots.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h", "director": "Yorgos Lanthimos", "studio": "Film4,WaypointEntertainment", "theater_date": "Dec 14, 2018", "dvd_date": "Feb 12, 2019", "box_office": "$34.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Think of The Favourite as humorous Barry Lyndon.

A filmmaker with enough maturity to transmit the most raw feelings of human reality accompanied by satire. [Full review in Spanish]", "Did you like or despise \"The Lobster?\" That answer will shape your opinion of \"The Favourite\" by Yorgos Lanthimos, whose international reputation precedes him, but whose signature style of absurdist black comedy is not my cup of tea.", "The Favourite is wickedly hysterical in a near perfect film and a career-best for Yorgos Lanthimos.", "A comely comedy of manners, supported by a cast that knows when to go for scandalous laughs and when to play it straight.", "The Favourite marks [Lanthimos'] most dynamic work yet in its dissection of class structure and gender politics, doling out pity and hilarity with equal aplomb.", "Olivia Colman puts in an award-winning performance in this hilarious bat-shit crazy picture which is by far Lanthimos at his uninhabited finest.", "It's actually Colman who steals our attention for every second she's on screen... It's a big performance that is also incredibly nuanced and sublimely amusing.", "An eccentric and irreverent film that efficiently develops a story about dependency through sublime technical elements and three flawless performances.[Full review in Spanish]", "One hell of a gleeful, devilish, wit-riddled ride. Lanthimos delivers a stylish, scrupulous period piece that toys with convention and provides hilarious highs and soul-crushing lows,", "It has left me stunned with the visual baroqueness that I witness in its staging and in some masterful performances from Rachel Weisz, Emma Stone and, especially, Olivia Colman as Queen Ana.
