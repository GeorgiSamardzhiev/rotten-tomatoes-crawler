{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Dr. Parnassus (Christopher Plummer), the leader of a traveling show, has a dark secret. Thousands of years ago he traded the soul of his daughter, Valentina, to the devil. Now the devil has come to collect his prize. To save her, Parnassus must make a final wager: Whoever collects five souls first will win Valentina. Tony (Heath Ledger), a man saved from hanging by Parnassus' troupe, agrees to help collect them, with his eye on marrying Valentina.", "rating": "64", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "2h 2m", "director": "Terry Gilliam", "studio": "InfinityEntertainment,PooPooPictures", "theater_date": "Jan 8, 2010", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$7.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["But it is difficult to be awed by Gilliam's imagination when it is so consistently unyoked to story and seems more about the director's own creative satisfaction than bequeathing his audience some reward for their time.", "A cinematic stage that can only be described as a pantheon of visual delights, let your imagination run wild and enter The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus.", "The contrast between the stark, bleak cities and the amazingly colorful, crazy acid-trip fantasy sequences was a visual treat. It definitely LOOKS fantastic. The problem is in the substance.", "Yet while I wish I could say that Parnassus' Imaginarium would be the twist where Gilliam's whimsy goes mainstream, this film will most likely remain a visual wonderland for Gilliam enthusiasts.", "Terry Gilliam... dives back into his diabolical imagination for this carny sideshow of a Faust tale in the blurry boundary between the material world and the dream world.", "The film is flawed, but you don't expect narrative drive or coherence; you go for the director's flights of fantasy. Possessed of an imagination that throws off more sparks than a fizzing, spinning Catherine Wheel, Gilliam is a fabulous fabulist.", "", "One of the greatest motion pictures ever. From its astounding themes to its brilliant cast, stunning design to enchanting score, undeniable smarts to lasting significance, this is Cin\u00e9ma! Buy this movie. View this movie. Marry this movie. I have spoken.", "The Imaginarium of Dr. Parnassus is one of those movies that, despite spectacular elements, doesn't add up to a spectacular film.", "A return to form for director Terry Gilliam?", "I don't think it's such a big heresy to say that Terry Gilliam is both a genius and an annoyingly full-of-it director who's coasting on the goodwill he earned with Brazil.", "It's like snorting a line of pure Gilliam.", "a confusing mess. ... a promising set-up assembled with bits and pieces of Gilliam's brilliance, but he clearly did not wake up in the middle of the night with a brilliant vision", "The fantastical, messy, noisy, everything-but-the-kitchen-sink result might be a tad crazy-making for some, but fans of Brazil, Time Bandits, and The Adventures of Baron Munchausen can step right up.", "Overplotted and the film ends up as a head-scratcher -- we're supposed to sympathize with Parnassus, but the case just isn't strongly made.", "Longo e com uma estrutura frouxa resultante das v\u00e1rias altera\u00e7\u00f5es, ainda peca pela resolu\u00e7\u00e3o artificial que poderia perfeitamente ser descrita como um decepcionante diabo ex machina. Ledger merecia uma despedida melhor.", "...Ledger's death casts a blue shadow over the entire proceedings, as Gilliam hasn't the heart to turn this parade of images into something like a meditation on the cost of achieving one's wildest fantasies.", "A trippy, uneven ride whose best assets are its imagination, Heath Ledger's final performance, and the three surprise stars who act as his replacements.", "Terry Gilliam can't catch a break.", "Fate's cruel trick -- taking Heath Ledger from us midway through filming -- has inspired Gilliam to make one of his most inventive and strange films."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "2/5", "", "C+", "", "1/5", "3.5/5", "", "", "5/10", "2/5", "8", "B-", "", "3/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Felicia Feaster", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Amie Simon", "Monika Bartyzel", "Sean Axmaker", "Jason Best", "Hank Sartin", "Gregory Weinkauf", "Christine Champ", "James O&#39;Ehley", "Dave White", "Widgett Walls", "Matt Kelemen", "Patty Jones", "Jeffrey Chen", "Pablo Villa\u00e7a", "Philip Martin", "Bruce Bennett", "Sean Burns", "Sean P.
