{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The horrors of World War I have robbed returning veteran Chris Baldry (Alan Bates) of his memory. The traumatized soldier doesn't even recognize his own wife, Kitty (Julie Christie), or remember their years together. While Baldry attempts to cope with the unfamiliar surroundings of his own home, he seeks out the company of an old flame from his childhood, Margaret Grey (Glenda Jackson). His amnesia also makes him a ready target for the affections of his older cousin, Jenny (Ann-Margret).", "rating": "43", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Alan Bridges", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 30, 2020", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["An exquisite screen version of Rebecca West's 1918 novel."], "rating": ["4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh"], "critic": ["Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spirituality &amp; Practice"], "date": ["April 7, 2011"]}}
