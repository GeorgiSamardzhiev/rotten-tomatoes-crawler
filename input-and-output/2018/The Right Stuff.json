{"metadata": {"synopsis": "This adaptation of the non-fiction novel by Tom Wolfe chronicles the first 15 years of America's space program. By focusing on the lives of the Mercury astronauts, including John Glenn (Ed Harris) and Alan Shepard (Scott Glenn), the film recounts the dangers and frustrations experienced by those involved with NASA's earliest achievements. It also depicts their family lives and the personal crises they endured during an era of great political turmoil and technological innovation.", "rating": "96", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama", "runtime": "3h 13m", "director": "Philip Kaufman", "studio": "TheLaddCompany", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 15, 2008", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Where 2001: A Space Odyssey depicted astronauts (and mankind) as being at the mercy of some higher, alien intelligence, The Right Stuff finds its characters imposing their will on the unknown.", "The Right Stuff is so clumsily shot and has such a simple structure that boredom can threaten to drown the viewer's patience. [Full Review in Spanish]", "An epic symphony of triumph that portrays modern man as the ultimate being driven by power. So visually stunning it looks almost experimental. [Full review in Spanish].", "Philip Kaufman's 1983 film is an efficient and absorbing recapitulation of the main events of Tom Wolfe's book that still never succeeds in capturing the inner drives and ethics of the test pilots and astronauts - the \"right stuff\" never materializes.", "Rarely has a film made a historic accomplishment seem so vivid and personal... It makes you wonder, quite suddenly, why there aren't more movies like this.", "The Right Stuff is a spectacular celebration of those heroes of the skies -- those fly jocks who fought the demons of space to launch a new era in American air technology.", "Masculinely romantic...", "Kaufman has combined the resources and ingenuity of movie making with the freewheeling, damn-the-conventions style of of the New Journalism and come up with a generous, high-spirited look at the bravery and lunacy that was that era.", "The Right Stuff (1983), Philip Kaufman's adaptation of Tom Wolfe's acclaimed portrait of the original NASA astronauts, is *the* American epic of the last great frontier and a genuinely romantic take on the first generation of space cowboys.", "It means something to be a member of the brotherhood whose trials and accomplishments are celebrated so enjoyably in The Right Stuff.", "A great movie that unfortunately failed to attract audiences back in '83, this adaptation of Tom Wolfe's book about astronauts pays tribute to what we would like to believe represents the American spirit: hard work, perseverance, camaraderie and vision.", "History, melodrama, comedy and satire are skilfully combined in this consistently exciting adventure. Visually and dramatically it rarely sags, there's a vivid array of characters and though it's a film with issues, these never eclipse the human drama.", "Moviegoers seeking a grand yet edifying entertainment, right-stuffed with what Kaufman calls \"seriousness of subject matter and a wild humor that comes out of left field,\" now know where to look...", "One of the scattered handful of truly great American movies in the first half of the 1980s.", "Educational, exciting action, great acting.", "The Right Stuff is a humdinger. Full of beauty, intelligence and excitement, this big-scale look at the development of the US space program and its pioneering aviators provides a fresh, entertaining look back at the recent past.", "Though critically acclaimed, Philip Kaufman's superbly realized adventure about the early Space Age was a commercial flop, due to its satirical tone and unfortunately close association with the presidential candidacy of John Glenn.", "Historical drama as well as vastly entertaining adventure.", "", "Consistently compelling, capturing all the ambiguity and tension of the book."], "rating": ["", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "4/4", "5/5", "", "9/10", "5/5", "", "A-", "5/5", "4/5", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Adam Nayman", "Diego Gal\u00e1n", "Federico Furzan", "Dave Kehr", "Arthur Knight", "Dolores Barclay", "Josh Larsen", "Sheila Benson", "Sean Axmaker", "Gary Arnold", "Matt Brunson", "Film4 Staff", "Richard Schickel", "Tim Brayton", "Randy White", "Variety Staff", "Emanuel Levy", "Steve Crum", "Cole Smithey", "Rob Fraser"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Ringer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinelipsis", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seanax.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Washington Post", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Common Sense Media", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Video-Reviewmaster.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ColeSmithey.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine"], "date": ["March 27, 2020", "February 7, 2020", "May 24, 2019", "February 4, 2019", "January 29, 2019", "October 22, 2018", "January 26, 2018", "December 9, 2016", "April 10, 2016", "December 18, 2015", "November 6, 2013", "October 5, 2011", "October 5, 2011", "March 1, 2011", "January 2, 2011", "March 26, 2009", "March 14, 2008", "February 18, 2008", "October 20, 2007", "December 30, 2006"]}}
