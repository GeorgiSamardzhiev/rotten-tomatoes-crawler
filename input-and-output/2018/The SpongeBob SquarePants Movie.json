{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this lively animated adventure, undersea oddball SpongeBob SquarePants and his starfish friend, Patrick, embark on a quest to clear the name of Mr. Krabs, the owner of the Krusty Krab restaurant, who has been framed for stealing the crown of ocean deity King Neptune.

Stretching the running time to 90 minutes doesnt help raise the level of appreciation, though.", "As much as I resisted the Bob, I have to admit this is actually a pretty funny film.", "The questions that the religious right needs to ask are how and why they ever confused homosexuality with pedophilia. Not only does blurring this issue do gays a disservice, it lets SpongeBob get away with murder.", "Very similar to the edgy animated TV show.", "It's never afraid to break out of movie conventions and revert back to its series randomness and sheer Monty Python-esque humor that made it a hit with kids in the first place.", "The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie takes on rather too much water during its extended feature-length submersion.", "The Nickelodeon cartoon series about an oceanic sponge and his starfish sidekick washes onto the big screen with a tide of weak one-liners, exaggerated reactions, and vaguely nauseating gags.", "Brilliantly funny, inventive and delirious.", "There are a few laughs for adults in this film. There are a few clever cultural references. Mostly, however, I found it underwhelming.", "The new feature film has some of the charm of the small-screen original, but it lacks the sustained goofiness of the series.", "It's back to the drawing board for the TV show's creators, who have previously proven themselves capable of much better than this soggy and waterlogged miscalculation.", "A film for kids, students, stoners, anyone who enjoys a break from reality.", "Anyone expecting anything more risky will be sadly disappointed.", "hile there is something a little familiar about the use of a journey narrative, and the hint of an uplifting message at the end of the film, the breezy insouciance, gleeful absurdity and wacky innocence of the series remains.", "The story is so good-naturedly silly that while not exactly challenging, it should keep even the grown-ups at least smiling.", "It has a freshness and energy that make a reassuring change from the typical hackneyed \"family\" films, both animated and live-action, that are ... foisted off on children.", "...asks the audience to endure three times as much frenetic potty humor, repetitive jokes and screechy voice acting as they are used to. The result is exhausting.", "SpongeBob's resilient, Pollyana-like nature is hard to resist.", "", "The film even manages to pull off a hilarious comic song (\"Now that we're men!\"), as well as providing new additions to playground vocabulary such as \"Knuckleheaded McSpazatron\"."], "rating": ["C", "", "F", "3/5", "3/4", "", "", "4/5", "C", "2/4", "2.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "3/4", "", "2/5", "B-", "6/10", "3/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Micheal Compton", "Dorothy Woodend", "Cole Smithey", "Nell Minow", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Todd McCarthy", "J.
