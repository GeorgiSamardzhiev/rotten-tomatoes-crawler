A phenomenal masterpiece that we should accept and give, cradled in own palms, to our friends and family.", "With gorgeously expressive animation reminiscent of Japanese scrolls and an irrepressible heroine who is full of life and joy and humor, this is an ancient folktale fresh with immediacy and relevance.", "A hand-drawn masterwork.", "Everything in it exudes a special magic that emanates in a slow and leisurely narrative rhythm, that transports us unfailingly to another time. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The result is a pleasing, if bloated and simplistic, experience destined to be overpraised because of its lauded creative team.", "Occasionally guilty of resting on its beauty in a way its protagonist never does.", "The Tale of Princess Kaguya is one of the most beautifully animated films of this or any other year.", "A melancholic swansong, it blends the director's prior occupations and provides a perfect canvas for a final visual flourish.", "The material might be fantastical, yet due to the universal themes of womanhood and true happiness, Princess Kaguya's story is exceptionally grounded.", "A great, grounded realist with a firm eye but a light touch, Takahata's leisurely swan song has a rare serenity and grace.", "Takahata brings his own feminist spin to Kaguya's coming of age, showing how this child of nature is repeatedly kept from happiness by the forces of patriarchy.", "In an era where anime films seem to blend into each other aesthetically, Takahata's impressions seems marvelously alive - its modesty in images makes them feel as if they're being created before our very eyes.", "A mezmerizing display of impresionist animation. [Full review in Spanish]", "There exists a compelling experiential satisfaction of the closure of a mythical character journey full of ebbs and flows, complexities and emotional introspection, all expressed fully in the compassionate drawings of director Isao Takahata.", "Flurries of expressiveness swirl into subtle shifts in style; it's these fiercely elemental illustrations of one girl's forbearance, defiance and longing which mark Takahata's The Tale of The Princess Kaguya as Studio Ghibli's fourth masterpiece.", "A hauntingly mesmeric masterpiece that creeps beneath the skin and truly transports the viewer into an enchanting world of myth and magic.", "A poignant gem, very different in tone to the director's most celebrated works, Grave of the Fireflies and Only Yesterday, but no less worthy of praise and admiration.", "The impression is of a continuous series of watercolours, similar to the narrative scroll revealed to Kaguya in a key scene.", "While the characters feel very simplified at times, there are scenes that put great weight on performance and subtle expressions, in a way that's nearer to the classical Disney tradition than most Japanese animation.", "As you'd expect from the co-founder of Studio Ghibli, Takahata has created a ravishing, technically perfect product and the hand-drawn, watercolour images explode with tender, humorous details."], "rating": ["", "", "3.5/5", "", "B-", "3/5", "A", "3/5", "", "", "", "B-", "", "", "", "5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Pieter-Jan Van Haecke", "MaryAnn Johanson", "Nicholas Bell", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Ryan Syrek", "Stephen O&#39;Nion", "Rachel Wagner", "Ben Nicholson", "Nguyen Le", "Daniel Kasman", "Anton Bitel", "Peter Labuza", "Jordi Costa", "Emine Yildirim", "Brian Gibson", "Mary Clare Waireri", "Mark Kermode", "Tara Brady", "Andrew Osmond", "Charlotte O&#39;Sullivan"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Psychocinematography", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flick Filosopher", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Reader (Omaha, NE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Script Lab", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MUBI", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Projected Figures", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Stage", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Today&#39;s Zaman (Turkey)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Vue Weekly (Edmonton, Alberta)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fan The Fire", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Observer (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Irish Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sight and Sound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard"], "date": ["December 15, 2020", "October 25, 2020", "September 6, 2019", "August 27, 2019", "August 6, 2019", "May 14, 2019", "May 6, 2019", "April 4, 2019", "October 10, 2018", "November 16, 2017", "January 26, 2017", "June 6, 2016", "March 18, 2016", "February 29, 2016", "May 25, 2015", "April 9, 2015", "March 22, 2015", "March 20, 2015", "March 20, 2015", "March 20, 2015"]}}
