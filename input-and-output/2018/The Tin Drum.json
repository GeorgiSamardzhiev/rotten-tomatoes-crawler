{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Oskar Matzerath (David Bennent) is a very unusual boy. Refusing to leave the womb until promised a tin drum by his mother, Agnes (Angela Winkler), Oskar is reluctant to enter a world he sees as filled with hypocrisy and injustice, and vows on his third birthday to never grow up. Miraculously, he gets his wish. As the Nazis rise to power in Danzig, Oskar wills himself to remain a child, beating his tin drum incessantly and screaming in protest at the chaos surrounding him.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "2h 22m", "director": "Volker Schl\u00f6ndorff", "studio": "GGB-14,HallelujahFilms,ArgosFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 23, 2017", "box_office": "$5.5K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Marches to the beat of its own drum.", "Schlondorff treads the thin line between fantasy and nightmare... always rewarding his audience with precious bits of humor, horror, and pathos.", "The best parts of The Tin Drum are its powerful and forceful images, the primitivism of the narrative, its overwhelming and justified beauty, and its child actor David Bennent. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The Tin Drum is, in fact, almost everything anybody could ask a film to be. It is strikingly original and continuously surprising.", "Walks a taut, high rope between doubles and split selves, docu-realism and surrealism, brutality and navet, sacred and profane, and history and myth, without falling into the safety net of childish fantasy. (It only falters in its final half-hour.)", "If ever [the characters in] a film embodied Hannah Arendt's principle of \"the banality of evil\", it's The Tin Drum...", "There are many themes running through The Tin Drum: resistance against an unkind world, the need for acceptance, the horrors of romance and war, and the final idea that growth is inevitable and unfortunately, necessary.", "In Volker Schlndorff's restored version of his 1979 classic, Oskar Matzerath emerges as a tragic anti-hero, whose lustful imagination and prodigious magical gifts can't shield him from the juggernaut of war.", "Schlndorff has a tendency to sketch the rest of the cast as simple grotesques or symbols of decadence that are unconvincingly humanized in the final third.", "The literal adaptation doesn't transfer that well to film.", "This movie rests on the small shoulders of David Bennent as 'three-year-old' Oskar Matzerath, and the undersized twelve-year-old comes up wonderful.", "Context is everything. Although often mistaken as a black comedy, Volker Schlndorff's bold adaptation of Gnter Grass's abstractly autobiographical 1959 novel is an exemplary model of European magic realist cinema.", "Fascinating allegory with war, death themes and little boy who won't grow up.", "Technically and stylistically, The Tin Drum is an astounding work. Thematically, it strives for an importance it only sometimes achieves", "", "", "", "The difficulty with The Tin Drum [is that it's] either (a) an allegory about one person's protest against the inhumanity of the world, or (b) the story of an obnoxious little boy.", "the film is more memorable for its quirky commingling of the epic and the intimate and its often startling visuals than for any of its big themes", "Oskar's story touches on so many facets of life it's hard to know where to start analyzing."], "rating": ["", "5/5", "", "", "", "8/10", "3/4", "4/4", "3/5", "B-", "", "A+", "5/5", "4/5", "2/5", "4/5", "3/5", "2/4", "3.5/4", "4.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Rob Aldam", "Bill Newcott", "Fernando Trueba", "Charles Champlin", "Brian Gibson", "Sarah Boslaugh", "Eric Melin", "Ela Bittencourt", "R.
