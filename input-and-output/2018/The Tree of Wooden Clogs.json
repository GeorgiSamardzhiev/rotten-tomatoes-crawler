{"metadata": {"synopsis": "On a northern Italian farm in the late 19th century, a group of sharecroppers eke out a threadbare existence. A priest advises Batisti (Luigi Ornaghi) and his wife, Batistina (Francesca Moriggi), that their young son, Minec (Omar Brignoli), should be formally educated, so they sacrifice his help in the fields and send him to school. When Minec's wooden shoe breaks one day, Batisti--in an act of desperation--puts the family's future at risk to replace the clog.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "2h 55m", "director": "Ermanno Olmi", "studio": "RAIRadiotelevisioneItaliana", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Feb 17, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A hypnotic look at a way of life that no longer exists.", "The asceticism of the film accentuates the slowness of a story that is already too prolonged. [Full Review in Spanish]", "I found the film most successful when it left its tenant farm setting for a lovely, lyrical boat trip to the big city, the one moment of expansiveness in Olmi's otherwise hermetic narration.", "The harmonious unity of Ermanno Olmi's film, despite one or two discordant notes, stems largely from the director's circumspect approach to all its elements. The parts are justly proportioned and nothing is allowed to command undue attention.", "The film has a tempo as slow as the seasons' turn, but there is something magnificent in its utter commitment and authenticity.", "Produces feelings of aching joy and melancholy in equal measure.", "Using a non-professional cast it demands patience, but stick with it and its warm, gentle humanism, plus Olmi's affection for his characters, soon become beguiling.", "You don't need to have experienced the film's world firsthand to grasp the transparency with which Olmi depicts it, full as it is with simple pleasures, complex emotions, and unadorned heartbreak.", "It's easy enough to appreciate...as a painterly near-documentary, shot and edited by a director who got his start in documentary films...or a spacious moral fable about humility and trust in following the righteous path.
