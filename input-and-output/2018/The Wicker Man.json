A film that's so utterly bad it's actually good.", "", "An exploitative mystery horror film in which Edward Woodward overacts his heart out.", "LaBute has replaced the seduction of the first film with a general sense of bewilderment and loss; it's good for building tension but doesn't fit with the payoff. The plot elements lead where they need to go well enough but don't mix particularly well.", "When The Wicker Man offers more laughs than Talladega Nights, it might be a sign for the auteur to switch brands to comedy", "Nicolas Cage gives the worst performance of his career opposite Kate Beahen in this useless update of Robin Hardy's far creepier 1973 original suspense movie based on Anthony Shaffer's novel.", "", "", "", "Laughable, awful, and downright ridiculous.", "...there's just something inherently entertaining about watching [Nicolas Cage] one-up himself every few minutes...", "In the final act of The Wicker Man, when Nicolas Cage has donned a bear suit, you have to wonder just what it is you're watching.", "It's a troubled strangeness - the uncommon sight of a literate studio film extolling messages most literate audiences can't get behind - that makes the movie's whole presence fascinating.", "...features an over-the-top leading man utilizing every single tic in his arsenal that has ever been impersonated by a comedian, and doing so seemingly with gleeful abandon and blissful unawareness", "The Wicker Man's long journey through the decades and across the ocean has led somewhere no one could have predicted, or wanted.", "Bad idea.
