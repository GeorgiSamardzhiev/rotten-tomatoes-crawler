It will challenge you in unexpected ways.", "It's remarkable filmmaking.", "As a twin myself, I was captivated by this downright shocking documentary about real-life triplets separated at birth.", "The relationships and situations are interesting, but they hardly rise in Three Identical Strangers above the level of an oddity.", "[A]s Three Identical Strangers moves from A to B and eventually to Z, it morphs from an piece of journalism to a study on human behavior, becoming a thriller under your nose.", "In all likelihood, the movie will enrage you; it's the type of emotional response that's difficult to aim in a specific direction, making it all the more frustrating as a morality tale.", "Tim Wardle gives us this brilliant bio-doc on the fate of separated-at-birth Jewish boy triplets...", "A new addition has joined the already impressive roster of feature-length documentaries this year.", "The clich\u00e9 \"stranger than fiction\" is probably used a little too freely, but this really is that.", "The film has a thesis, which is incredibly refreshing for a documentary. It wraps up both the narrative it constructed, and offers its audience a little nugget of hope...", "It's a story that delights and infuriates. It raises questions about justice and ethics, makes cases on both sides of the nature-versus-nurture argument, and draws parallels between what happened to the boys a few short decades ago.", "The very engaging and thought-provoking Three Identical Strangers does justice to its extraordinary real-life tale and effortlessly proves that reality sure can be stranger - and perhaps even more disturbing - than fiction.", "The differences between them had to come from somewhere, and in exploring the source, the film gets to the heart of something profound about its three identical strangers, and the rest of us as well.", "It combines interviews, archive footage and dramatic reconstructions to take us as close in to the story as possible, not coming to any conclusions. You won't be able to look away.", "Three Identical Strangers succeeds far beyond its role as a documentary and even holds the ingredients necessary for a thriller.
