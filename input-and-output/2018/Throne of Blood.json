When the first part of the spirit's prophecy comes true, Washizu's scheming wife, Asaji (Isuzu Yamada), presses him to speed up the rest of the spirit's prophecy by murdering his lord and usurping his place.

W. Griffith among the supreme creators of cinema.", "No stage production could match Kurosawa's Birnam Wood, and, in his final framing of the hero -- a human hedgehog, stuck with arrows -- he conjures a tragedy not laden with grandeur but pierced, like a dream, by the absurd.", "Throne Of Blood defeats categorisation. It remains a landmark of visual strength, permeated by a particularly Japanese sensibility, and is possibly the finest Shakespearean adaptation ever committed to the screen.", "More an impression of Macbeth than an actual Macbeth>/i>.", "Akira Kurosawa's remarkable 1957 restaging of Macbeth in samurai and expressionist terms is unquestionably one of his finest works -- charged with energy, imagination, and, in keeping with the subject, sheer horror.", "A potent adaptation that captures all the strange atmosphere of Shakespeare's play, and invests it an exhilarating, visceral aesthetic.", "One of Kurosawa's best and arguably the best Shakespeare ever filmed.", "In fact, in the scene where Lady Asaji leaves a room and disappears into the darkness to get sake to make the guards drunk, the ominous rustling of her silk gown is as chilling as Lady Macbeth's lines.", "Toshiro Mifune gives a winning quirky performance.", "Transplanted to medieval Japan, Kurosawa's brutal film is one of the best Shakesperean adaptations on screen, with a tour de force performance from Toshiro Mifune; it makes a fascinating double bill with the masterful Ran", "With its all-pervading sense of doom, this is a serious contender for the finest celluloid Shakespeare of them all.", "It's visually ravishing, as you would expect, employing compositional tableaux from the Noh drama, high contrast photography, and extraordinary images of rain, galloping horses, the birds fleeing from the forest.", "", ""], "rating": ["", "4/4", "1", "9/10", "4.5/5", "5/5", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "", "", "1", "A", "A-", "5/5", "", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Kenneth Cavander", "Matt Brunson", "Matthew Sorrento", "Christopher Long", "Keith Phipps", "", "", "Anthony Lane", "Derek Malcolm", "Ken Hanke", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "", "Jeffrey M.
