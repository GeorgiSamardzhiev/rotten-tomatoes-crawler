{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Glam rock star Brian Slade (Jonathan Rhys Myers) plays a character on stage named Maxwell Demon who predicts his death on stage. Shortly after he announces his prediction, he fakes his own death and is exposed as a fraud. A decade later in 1984, a reporter and former fan, Arthur Stuart (Christian Bale), tracks down the former rocker to do an article on his life and downfall. Arthur interviews the man who discovered Slade and a peer (Ewan McGregor) to understand Slade's motivations.", "rating": "58", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "2h 3m", "director": "Todd Haynes", "studio": "SingleCellPictures,ZenithProductions,MiramaxFilms,GoldwynFilms,NewmarketCapitalGroup,KillerFilms", "theater_date": "Nov 6, 1998", "dvd_date": "Jan 20, 2016", "box_office": "$1.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Though it is thoroughly engaging and appropriately hallucinatory, the film's Orson Welles inspired story structure and fluctuating tonality is irritatingly cumbersome.", "Haynes makes the dream so sweet, you can't help but return again and again to crushing glamor and gorgeousness of Velvet Goldmine.", "There is a deep sense of ennui embedded in Velvet Goldmine, an acknowledgement that something singular from those years of glam can never be recaptured.", "I'm telling you, I was bored stiff.", "Haynes' chronicle of the glam era is visually rich but too dramatically fragmented and overwhelmed by music to permit involvement in the tale's characters or the director's POV.", "The style is devilishly flamboyant and gleefully indulgent; every shot is full of amazing stuff. The edits dance and twist. It's a glam movie about a glam subject.", "", "Velvet Goldmine gives the rock movie a makeover.", "While some gay men's fantasies center around muscled jocks, cops or cowboys, Todd Haynes' would seem to be of a slightly more arcane bent.", "", "", "the ending happens at least half an hour later than it should", "Repeat viewings will allow one to piece together the fragmented montage as a melancholic ode to freedom, and those who fight for it through art.", "", "", "", "A bizarre thing, this trippy movie takes you on a whirlwind tour of Brit glam rock and doesn't let go.
