{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Repression is the rule of the day in this film that skewers Greek governance of the 1960s. Z (Yves Montand), a leftist rabble rouser, is killed in what appears to be a traffic accident. But given the political climate, the death of such a prominent activist raises troubling questions. Though it's too late to save Z's life, a postmortem examination suggests that the ruling party was behind his death. As the facts leak out, those who tell the truth pay the price for their honesty.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 7m", "director": "Costa-Gavras", "studio": "RegganeFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 7, 2017", "box_office": "$83.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Trintignant's performance is masterful.", "[Director Costa-Gavras's] handling of the Lambrakis facts resulted in an uptempo, taut, jazzy type movie designed to hold the interest of even Hollywood-conditioned, mystery-action addicts.", "For some reason foreign movies about sex and political life are so far above American movies on the subjects that there is really no comparison.
