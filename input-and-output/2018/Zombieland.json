{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After a virus turns most people into zombies, the world's surviving humans remain locked in an ongoing battle against the hungry undead. Four survivors -- Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson) and his cohorts Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg), Wichita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin) -- abide by a list of survival rules and zombie-killing strategies as they make their way toward a rumored safe haven in Los Angeles.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Comedy/Horror", "runtime": "1h 27m", "director": "Ruben Fleischer", "studio": "PariahFilms", "theater_date": "Oct 2, 2009", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": "$75.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Complete with spectacular gore, creative cursing, outrageous slow-motion ransacking, a modest amount of romance, and a tour of the palatial Bill Murray estate.", "If you thought Shaun of the Dead delivered the last word in Zombie horror-comedy, Zombieland shows that you can still get fresh laughs from the festering carcasses of the living dead.", "In an extended cameo, Bill Murray shows up with his own brand of dry, yet over-the-top humor that may very well serve as the film's highlight.", "Eisenberg's millennial character undergoes a reality-TV-scripted makeover...", "Not for everyone, Zombieland succeeds in demonstrating that the undead has their uses: mainly to make us laugh even when we're horrified.", "It is a parody of terror that bores me with its double tap of absurdism. [Full review in Spanish]", "Zombieland somehow manages to be refreshing, exciting, gory and funny.", "Zombieland's special top secret guest star adds a degree of imagination to the script that only serves to point out how emaciated the writing is at other moments.", "The performances are enthusiastic, the dialogue is snappy and the kills are an absolute riot; in short, [Zombieland] does exactly what it says on the tin, and does it perfectly.", "Witty, tart, and sometimes touching, with a great cast and suitably disgusting, blood-drooling zombies.", "The future of the American family.", "At a scant 80 minutes, Zombieland flies by but still manages to pack in more thrills and laughs than about 10 movies.", "A rather mindless bit of fun with a strong cast milking every ounce of entertainment out of a pretty clever premise.", "Woody Harrelson... is at his peak in this clever, fast-paced zom-com.", "They said zombie romance couldn't be done, but new gorecom Zombieland proves it can. And it's not sappy romance either - it delivers the angsty, twitchy, hyperverbal courtship style of the geek generation.", "Action, zombies, and funny as hell. This movie is definitely a movie meant to let you just sit back and enjoy the little things.", "It's an okay DVD rental choice but doesn't go beyond that.", "With its quick pace and witty writing, it's a nonstop, snarky ride.", "One of the best movies of the year, as well as one of the funniest.", "Fleischer is after only one thing: to entertain the pants off of you."], "rating": ["8/10", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "5/10", "4/5", "", "5/5", "4/5", "", "3/4", "", "4/5", "", "", "C-", "", "", "B"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Jason Best", "Richard Propes", "A.S.
