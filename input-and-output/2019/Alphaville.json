{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Government agent Lemmy Caution (Eddie Constantine) is dispatched on a secret mission to Alphaville, a dystopian metropolis in a distant corner of the galaxy. Caution is hot on the trail of rogue agent Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff) and a scientist named Von Braun, the creator of Alpha 60, a computer that uses mind control to rule over residents of Alphaville. Caution is aided in his quest to destroy the despotic computer ruler by Von Braun's own daughter, Natacha (Anna Karina).", "rating": "91", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Mystery & Suspense/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Jean-Luc Godard", "studio": "AthosFilms,Filmstudio,Chaumiane", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 15, 2016", "box_office": "$46.6K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Take(s) elements of classic Hollywood and twist(s) them into a haunting foreshadowing of the Godard to come.", "It really does feel like Godard has transported us to some other world, even if it's all a colossal put-on.", "...Godard is having a bit of a laugh...and if everything in this film is just too much of whatever it is, that's totally deliberate on his part.", "Godard whips this peculiar m\u00e9lange of cinematic influences and invention into a work that is stimulating, stylish, and irresistible.", "Always something strangely individualistic, utterly contemporary, and yet for all that, riddled with dj vu, cultural echo chambers, a kind of deliberately outmoded sleight-of-hand.", "It's so archly intellectual that you fear it might splinter if you poke it in the ribs. It's also endlessly playful in its worship of American movie tropes, and deeply resourceful.", "Both derivative and prophetic, this New Wave dystopian fable both looks back at the history of cinema and forward to its future. Hail, Lemmy Caution, father of Rick Deckard.", "Nothing about this strange, moving work of agit-pop has ever seemed out of date. If anything, \"Alphaville\" moves closer to relevance with every passing year.", "A bracing salute to American gangster pics, with a jumpy European post-war uncertainty thrown in.", "Despite its age it's that rare science fiction film that doesn't seem to have dated at all.", "It's one of the great cinematic works of romanticism, as well as a sort of filmed revelation of the very essence of science-fiction movies and German silent classics -- their blend of social critique, emotional liberation, and paranoia.", "Science fiction meets film noir in a way that made possible the existence of Blade Runner, The Terminator and countless other books and films.", "Although this is drastically different compared to the rest of Godard's oeuvre, it has without a doubt had a lasting impact with its ground-breaking visuals.", "No movie, not even Breathless, better exemplifies the syncretic quality of Godard's early genius.", "One of [Godard's] most entertaining movies is also one of his most timeless.", "Its melding of classic Hollywood archetypes and a terrifying future was ahead of its time when it was released. Five decades later, filmmakers are still trying to catch up.", "If an iPod commercial had a nightmare, it would look like Alphaville", "Iconic in its very grain, the film toggles effortlessly between toast-dry farce and vogueing postwar hipitude, and like the balletic swimmers performing mid-pool state executions, it's a thing of insensible beauty.", "Karina proves to be the beating heart of the movie, getting its piercing last line (no spoilers here).
