It shows both sides and lets you make up your own mind.", "What's remarkable about the American Factory is its reluctance to take sides in this picturesque duel of cultural conquests, and its commitment to exposing the labor exploitation. [Full review in Spanish]", "The unflinching examination is a bit of a mirror to the face and a gripping drama of where we are and may be heading.", "The filmmaking does not advocate; it shows, never tells, and poses many more questions than it can answer. Some disturbing realities about the struggle for dignity in work emerge from what we witness.", "Could not have been more timely.", "Indeed, race relations seem to be a recurring theme, but one the filmmakers refuse to address head-on.", "Rarely does a sober, even-keeled reckoning come along to illuminate the human suffering of creative destruction while gently acknowledging that this is the way it has to be. Such a portrayal is American Factory, a heartbreaking Netflix documentary.", "American Factory is a case study in cross-cultural miscommunication and national personality clash.", "Billionaire from \"communist\" China buys former GM plant and pays workers less than what McDonald's pays. Evidence that capitalism victimizes workers across the planet, whatever the ideology.", "\"American Factory\" is a disturbing economic expos\u00e9 about the way we live now, and a cautionary tale about the vanishing middle class.", "The result is entertaining as hell at points but doesn't condescend either side and, at its best moments, juggles a swath of opinions with equal reason.", "This consideration of multiple lives, rather than one constructed arc serves to underline the sense that each person is only a small cog turning in the bigger wheel of the machine.", "Too dispassionate to be a rallying cry, too sobering to be a \"wake-up call,\" but still a terrific fly-on-the-wall look at the struggles of America's working class.", "This documentary film gets right in the middle of a culture war, a union versus management fight and anxiety over globalization and automation. It shows what is happening in manufacturing in many countries, including the United States.", "The result is a story balanced enough to let its themes and outcomes speak largely for themselves, offering a lucid sense of who its people are.", "...captures some remarkably frank assessments of the process from both camps."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "4.5/5", "3/4", "B", "", "7/10"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Chris Barsanti", "Gisela Savdie", "A.S.
