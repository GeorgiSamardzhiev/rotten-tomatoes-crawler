When Marco gets beaten up by one of Timmy's primary school friends, the two boys wind up on rival sides of a never-ending cycle of gang wars in which there are no winners, only hapless victims.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 31m", "director": "Rapman", "studio": "ParamountPictures,BBCFilms,JoiProductions,DJFilms,WrushMedia", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 5, 2020", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's brutal, raw, and often hard to watch - and hard to understand at times. However, it is striking and will stay with you well after you watch it. The storytelling, with narrative hip hop interludes from Rapman is totally unique and fresh.", "A strong debut from Rapman, who shows an eye for visual dynamics, an ear for tone and a sense of swift, energized pacing - all signs of exceptional auteurism.", "Through rhyme and reason with Rapman in his element, Blue Story is a carefully articulated piece of art that should be judged on its own merits. And if you still feel that this film glamorises gang culture, then you haven't been paying attention.", "In an overabundance of movies and TV shows that portray Black men as criminals, Blue Story sets itself apart by having well-developed characters and believable acting that give this story more depth than the run-of-the-mill gangster film.", "If the theme of Blue Story is the perpetuating and destructive cycle of revenge, it does well in convincing the power of its poison.", "A theatrical, rap-infused standard-issue issue melodrama [that's also vaguely] reminiscent of classic '30s gangster films.", "Although its narrative features the universal underpinnings of Shakespearean tragedy, the well-performed but familiar through line, developed from Rapman's previous YouTube series, is often a bit too on-the-nose.", "Blue Story's ambitions therefore far outweigh its minor faults. And with this execution and knack for artistic flare, Rapman may be a talent to watch out for in the future.", "Love, loss, family and friendship ferociously collide, without distracting us from either its fun or energy. It's a balancing act only a rapper could pull off.", "Blue Story can be messy in stretches, but it's undeniably passionate and carried by its simple, yet effective, and sometimes lyrical storytelling.", "A timeless, even old-fashioned cautionary tale; one that resonates the same whether you're a Jet or a Shark or just a kid on the other side of the Atlantic, trying to make it out of this world alive.", "Blue Story, at its essence, is a narrative you've seen before. But Onwubolu vests it with firecracker energy-the pace never drags, even when you think you know what's going to happen next.", "A natural and spontaneous feel is accentuated by the foot-thumping musical score by Jonathon Deering. Also, characters sing or rap in-between dramatic scenes with lyrics that augment feelings and plot points. Call it \"rap narration.\"", "An almost-Shakespearean coming-of-age story set against an authentic urban landscape.", "It's a Shakespearean rhapsody in indigo where love, friendship, betrayal and revenge swirl and blur with life-changing consequences.", "Rapman's gritty and provocative feature debut provides a fresh setting for its otherwise familiar coming-of-age urban drama.", "The film has a powerful sense of place, with details that feel authentic and, in some cases, lived through.", "Aside from these compelling young actors, the success here is the fresh and original voice of Rapman, who has said \"Blue Story\" is largely based on his own life...", "If you want a blast of pure nitro in your pandemic viewing, start streaming this standout first feature from rapper-director-actor Andrew Onwubolu, a.k.a. Rapman, who uses hip-hop beats to bring mythic weight to this British youth-gang drama", "Rough-hewn but bursting with urgency."], "rating": ["9.0", "", "3.5/5", "", "", "2.5/4", "2.5/5", "B", "B+", "3/5", "B-", "", "", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Paul Salfen", "John Serba", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Carla Hay", "Jordan Calhoun", "Peter Canavese", "Nicholas Bell", "Matthew Dougherty", "Asher Luberto", "Sandy Schaefer", "Leah Greenblatt", "Stephanie Zacharek", "Dwight Brown", "Edward Douglas", "Kevin Crust", "Todd Jorgenson", "Ben Kenigsberg", "Jocelyn Noveck", "Peter Travers", "Frank Scheck"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">AMFM Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Decider", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">VultureHound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Culture Mix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Black Nerd Problems", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Celluloid Dreams", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Filtered Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Playlist", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Screen Rant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">National Newspaper Publishers Association", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Weekend Warrior", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemalogue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Rolling Stone", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hollywood Reporter"], "date": ["November 25, 2020", "November 6, 2020", "September 3, 2020", "July 18, 2020", "May 20, 2020", "May 16, 2020", "May 16, 2020", "May 8, 2020", "May 8, 2020", "May 8, 2020", "May 8, 2020", "May 7, 2020", "May 6, 2020", "May 6, 2020", "May 6, 2020", "May 6, 2020", "May 5, 2020", "May 5, 2020", "May 5, 2020", "May 4, 2020"]}}
