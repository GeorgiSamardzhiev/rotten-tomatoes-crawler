{"metadata": {"synopsis": "New York mobster Benjamin \"Bugsy\" Siegel (Warren Beatty) leaves New York City to dip into the glamour of Hollywood, Calif., and to build up syndicate gambling rackets. Bowled over by actress Virginia Hill (Annette Bening), the dapper Siegel courts her, despite having a wife and children. Obsessed with creating a gambling haven, Siegel takes racketeering to the Nevada desert and helps develop Las Vegas, only to find himself in deep water over his reckless construction of the Flamingo Hotel.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 15m", "director": "Barry Levinson", "studio": "TriStarPictures,BaltimorePictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 8, 2014", "box_office": "$48.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Annette Bening is phenomenal as sultry, foul-mouthed femme fatale/corporate lieutenant Virginia Hill. Worth watching for her alone.", "From James Toback's crackling script to Warren Beatty's electric performance as gangster Ben Siegel, Bugsy is so engrossing that you feel uncharitable mentioning that while splendid in individual scenes, Barry Levinson's movie lacks propulsion.", "What finally distinguishes Bugsy from other mob movies is its ever-present sense of the absurd.", "Insouciant and flashy, co-producer Beatty is at his best when evoking the narcissistic, show-business side of Siegel.", "A great deal of the fun of watching this very assured film is seeing with what energetic panache the actor takes on the mantle of the mobster J. Edgar Hoover once called \"the most dangerous man in America.\"", "The picture belongs, in every sense of the word, to Beatty.", "Most actors give more contained performances as they get older or else they risk self-parody. Beatty, who has always seemed larger than life, gets even larger with age -- and on him it looks good.", "Beatty and Annette Bening charge their roles with energy, and the supporting cast includes such talents as Harvey Keitel, Joe Mantegna, Ben Kingsley, and Elliott Gould in sturdy performances.", "While Bugsy expertly captures the glamor of '40s Hollywood, it fails as the drama of a man whose dreams of glory lure him to an ignominious end.", "Warren Beatty delivers some of his best acting in years as Bugsy Siegel, the gangster responsible for the inception of Las Vegas as we now know it.", "A clump of casinos in the sand is evidence of something, but I'm pretty sure it's not greatness.", "Oh, it's not that they cover up Siegel's brutal side, it's just that they undercut it by making the man just a victim of his own appetites, which is sort of like saying Charles Manson was just a little too enthusiastic about a certain Beatles tune.", "While avoiding the usual gangster film clichs, director Barry Levinson also insists that Warren Beatty does more than coast through this movie on matine idol looks and easy charm.", "Beatty's daring schizophrenic performance -- on the one hand charming and gregarious, on the other a brutal killing machine -- makes this one of the best performances (but not films) of his career.", "Levinson's direction is brisk and, for a film largely about the allure of glamour, suitably flashy.", "Barry Levinson's good-looking gangster pic may be nowhere near GoodFellas-calibre mob drama, but it manages to convey the menace and glamour of real-life west coast hood Benjamin 'Bugsy' Seigel (Warren Beatty) with evocative style.", "As Siegel, Warren Beatty hones the finest characterization of his career.", "Not just another gangster picture, as some had feared. James Toback`s sparkling script as interpreted by director Barry Levinson and producer-star Warren Beatty is both a rare love story between equals and a portrait of a dreamer.", "Barry Levinson's Bugsy will reignite your passion for inventive foul-mouthery, so inventively crafted and spitefully delivered are its swears.", "Exhausting in all the wrong ways."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "3/4", "", "", "4/5", "", "", "", "2/4", "2.5/4", "4/5", "", "3.5/4", "3/5", "", "3.5/4", "4/5", "C"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Eve Tushnet", "Carrie Rickey", "John Hartl", "Clifford Terry", "Kenneth Turan", "Richard Schickel", "Jay Boyar", "David Sterritt", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Gary Thompson", "Dan Webster", "John Marriott", "", "", "", "Roger Hurlburt", "Gene Siskel", "Simon Miraudo", "Rob Humanick"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Patheos", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seattle Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spokesman-Review (Washington)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Quickflix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Projection Booth"], "date": ["March 26, 2020", "October 29, 2014", "October 29, 2014", "October 29, 2014", "October 29, 2014", "October 29, 2014", "October 29, 2014", "October 29, 2014", "October 29, 2014", "October 29, 2014", "October 29, 2014", "October 29, 2014", "October 29, 2014", "October 29, 2014", "October 29, 2014", "October 29, 2014", "October 29, 2014", "October 29, 2014", "October 20, 2014", "January 15, 2012"]}}
