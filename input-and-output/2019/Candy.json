{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A fatherly chemistry professor (Geoffrey Rush) indulges two young lovers (Heath Ledger, Abbie Cornish) in their ever-increasing heroin habits.

Despite good performances and excellent cinematography, this is a struggle that the filmmaker loses.", "Davies has no new insights into the heroin spiral, but this silly melodrama benefits from the palpable chemistry between Ledger and Cornish", "", "... Candy is a rewarding experience. It may not be one that you will want to return to any time soon, but it is one that you will not soon forget.", "Without real characters or a fresh take on drug addiction, Candy has little to recommend it for anyone who's seen The Basketball Diaries or Requiem for a Dream.", "The performances are good, but it would be hard to recommend this to anyone unless you have a lovely daughter who's dating a sleaze-bag and you want her to watch it as a deterrent.", "Undeniably affecting.", "Hands up if you don't know that drugs are bad for you.", "... it feels more like something out of American cinema from the late 1960s or early 70s [and] may say more about the state of Australian film than anything else.", "\"Candy\" won't make anyone forget \"Trainspotting\" (1996) or \"Requiem for a Dream\" (2000), but nor will \"Candy\" let those who see it soon forget the experience.", "The question is whether \"Candy\" is intended to be an honest and unflinching look at the junkie life, or merely trying to top \"Trainspotting\" and its ilk.", "There's no moment that truly feels original until Candy's climactic breakdown at the end of the movie. By then, it's too late.", "Here's a prime candidate for your 'Films to miss' list.", "Those with the stomach for searing drama will recognise superior writing, direction and acting in one of the most heartbreaking films of the year.", "Candy is pretty much the standard, downbeat, drug-addicts-in-love tale we've seen repeatedly over the years.", "It's not entertainment by any means, but it is riveting and rewarding viewing.", "Think of this warts-and-all misadventure as the cinematic equivalent of a 'Just Say No' public service announcement.", "A dispiriting, predictable slog toward either (a) redemption or (b) death."], "rating": ["3/5", "3/4", "3/5", "C", "2/5", "", "", "3/5", "3/4", "2.5/5", "C", "3/4", "2.5/4", "3/5", "", "4/5", "2/4", "3/4", "3.5/4", "C"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Leigh Paatsch", "Matt Brunson", "Kaleem Aftab", "Amy Nicholson", "Michael Szymanski", "Felix Gonzalez Jr.", "Katey Rich", "Cherryl Dawson and Leigh Ann Palone", "Terry Lawson", "Josh Bell", "Ted Murphy", "Phil Villarreal", "Rob Thomas", "Kerry Lengel", "Jean Lowerison", "Angie Errigo", "Jeff Vice", "Sean P.
