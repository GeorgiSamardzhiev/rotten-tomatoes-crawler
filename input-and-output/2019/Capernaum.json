The levels of economic hardship, want and degradation are extreme. Labaki's camera is unflinching.", "In the world of Capernaum, the impoverished aren't developed. They're siphons for tragedy, wading through a script that grasps for discrepancies.", "It is made with a dramatic pulsation, close to the documentary, which in few scenes abandons social realism when it addresses the vicissitudes of the street children.

Zain Al Rafeea is amazing.", "Zain, estimated age 12 and serving five years' jail time \"because I stabbed a sonofabitch,\" is suing his neglectful parents for giving birth to him.", "Labaki's film documents a world largely governed by concentric circles of suffering and exploitation, but in her screenplay and through her eye, there are no villains here ...", "Capernaum is much more than a reductionist vision about the extreme vulnerability of children in an atmosphere of extreme poverty.
