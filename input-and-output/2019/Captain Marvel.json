But I'll take that trade, given that it's showing us something new.", "Captain Marvel is the living embodiment of some of the MCU's worst tendencies, but still ends up being an enjoyable ride and a fine introduction for Carol Danvers.", "While I felt let down by the lack of action, I left the theater with far more to chew on. I felt vindicated too ... She personifies strength and courage, and she's a character our daughters should see represented on the big screen.", "... at some point you just wish the writers would ease up a bit and stop attempting to wring comedy out of each and every situation.", "[Captain Marvel] is a blast-- a rip roarin' thrill ride full of humor, heart and guilty-pleasure '90s nostalgia that flips the expectation of an origin story genre on its head.", "Despite the standalone nature of this film, the first 40 minutes or so are fairly rough in design, structuring, and visuals.", "This film pulls off the impressive feat of making an origin story interesting by upending the usual structure of these tales, throwing us headlong into the action with the title heroine and only then revealing how she became an intergalactic warrior.", "Captain Marvel may be a safe superhero origin film that provides expected action and humor... But regardless, it's still a satisfying entry in the MCU carried by an effortless star turn from Brie Larson.", "Captain Marvel is a good film that does great things for the Marvel Comics Universe.", "It's far from being the best MCU film, but it does a decent job on introducing on of the most powerful characters of that universe. [Full review in Spanish]", "Despite the notable limitations, Captain Marvel delightfully serves its purpose both as a final cornerstone in this epic-long saga but the inspiration gained from seeing a female superhero on screen.", "The stakes are far too small for what should be a momentous Marvel movie, and Larson doesn't get to kick anywhere near enough shape-shifting butt.", "If the emotion falls a little short, though, the movie soars with its comedy and action elements.", "The movie doesn't go far enough in any direction, grounding itself in a mildly entertaining but surprisingly pass\u00e9 center.", "A film that plays it safe with familiar formula but is so entertainingly empowering that it will inspire girls everywhere.", "At a positively brisk two hours, the film has an old-school action movie vibe that is a long-overdue introduction to a character who holds great promise in years to come.", "Larson is terrific as Vers/Carol Danvers/Captain Marvel.", "A no-nonsense, punchy and fierce introduction to Captain Marvel - Who runs the world?
