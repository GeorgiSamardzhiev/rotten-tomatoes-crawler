Stand back, but stay watching.", "With its fresh approach to the lead character, its boost of severity, and its return to the source material, it proves to be the jumpstart the franchise has been begging for.", "In all the Bond movies, this is the most emotional and personal Bond adventure I've seen.", "I've been a fan of Craig since the little known Layer Cake and I am happy to say he does an outstanding job as Bond", "'Casino Royale' is not only the \"best of all time\" Bond movie, but also one of the strongest vehicles in the action genre we've seen since the beginning of the century. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The film has breathless stunts and encounters aplenty.", "In Daniel Craig, the producers found a suitably tarnished and brutal icon for this new iteration of Bond", "James Bond is back, and as it turns out, he's been gone a lot longer than anyone even realized.", "Bond is back. Bond is beefy. And the new Bond is blond. Daniel Craig has comfort ably slipped into the tuxedo, size 007, and left audiences shaken and stirred.", "When Bond kills an adversary in a hotel stairwell, the violence is nasty and brutal - and you feel bystander Vesper's shock and revulsion too. She doesn't merely wince and get over it, as so many of her predecessors did; she's clearly traumatised.", "Casino Royale is exactly what the franchise needs to keep in the game against the Bournes and Missions: Impossible of the world.", "This is a much more serious Bond than we've seen in many years. Daniel Craig inhabits the dark side of the secret agent really well, he is absolutely the best Bond since Connery.", "Craig's humanised, more flawed interpretation of the role balances Campbell's physical direction and co-writer Paul Haggis's sparing wit, while Eva Green provides an alluring love interest.", "I think this is a very intelligent film for a Bond film, and certainly one of the most enjoyable.", "This is a Bond movie, and everything comes back to him and the actor who plays him. The filmmakers took a big gamble on Daniel Craig and on a script that updates everything. This time, the gamble paid off.", "The screenwriters have brought Bond back toward the book.", "Why see yet another James Bond movie? Because Casino Royale, Martin Campbell's rewiring of the series, is a real movie, and not just a James Bond movie.", "The ace up the film's sleeve is Craig's foil, Eva Green, playing Vesper Lynd, the British accountant assigned to bankroll Bond's escapades. Calling her a Bond Girl would be an oversimplification.", "Unlike recent Bonds, whose kills had no more weight than the one-liners that generally accompanied them, Craig's tend to be intimate, bloody, and devoid of glamour."], "rating": ["", "4/5", "9/10", "4.5/5", "B", "", "3/4", "4/5", "A", "4/5", "", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Leigh Paatsch", "Mike Massie", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Micheal Compton", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Namrata Joshi", "PJ Nabarro", "Zaki Hasan", "Udita Jhunjhunwala", "Jason Best", "Daniel Saney", "Margaret Pomeranz", "Andrew Collins", "David Stratton", "Nanciann Cherry", "John Harkness", "Richard von Busack", "Michael Hastings", "Christopher Orr"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">World Socialist Web Site", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Herald Sun (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Confessions From A Geek Mind", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bowling Green Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Espinof", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Outlook", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Zaki&#39;s Corner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hindustan Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Talk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Digital Spy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">At the Movies (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">At the Movies (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Toledo Blade", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">NOW Toronto", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">MetroActive", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Metro Times (Detroit, MI)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Atlantic"], "date": ["February 14, 2021", "November 17, 2020", "November 15, 2020", "July 16, 2020", "November 20, 2019", "September 10, 2019", "January 17, 2019", "December 16, 2018", "November 2, 2018", "December 14, 2017", "November 10, 2017", "November 2, 2015", "November 2, 2015", "November 2, 2015", "November 2, 2015", "November 2, 2015", "November 2, 2015", "November 2, 2015", "November 2, 2015", "November 2, 2015"]}}
