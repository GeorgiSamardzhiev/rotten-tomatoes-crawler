{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A trio of elite private investigators armed with the latest in high-tech tools, high-performance vehicles, martial arts techniques and an array of disguises unleash their state-of-the-art skills on land, sea and air to track down a kidnapped billionaire-to-be and keep his top-secret voice-identification software out of lethal hands.

But the film remains a kitschy, kick-butt confection that embraces the utter disposability of its severe necklines, sheer pantylines and silly plotlines.", "Barrymore is the best of the three here but the group has great chemistry and they work well as a cohesive unit.", "Though undeniably flawed, the movie...remains a surprisingly fun watch.", "Edgy girl power fun. You go, girls!", "It's a hollow package that dumbs down wherever possible.", "A radiantly dopey Saturday-night escape hatch.", "The film is the equivalent of the 'dumb blonde' of action movies. No plot? No problem. Smile pretty now.", "", "This is nothing but trailer moments. Ex-pop video director McG couldn't organise a pillow fight in a bedding factory.", "The most fun movie of the year.", "", "Charlie's Angels is like a Hong Kong flick but without the bogus spirituality and excruciating schlock-pop ballads.", "Charlie's Angels never slows down, and even when it's not delivering the thrills or a fun fight scene, it's being just plain funny.", "A virtual big-budget explosion? Yes. A spectacle of three great actresses making fools of themselves? Sure. MTV-worthy martial arts monages that shamelessly rip off The Matrix? Yessireebob. But a movie? No. Not for an instant.", "Slick film fun like this doesn't come along very often.", "Silly, unoriginal and lacking any socially redeeming value whatsoever.", "For a movie that gets its inspiration from one of the cheesiest television shows of the extra-cheesy 1970s, Charlie's Angels is surprisingly cool.", "This is the enjoyably dumb action movie that Mission Impossible could (and should) have been.", "A real mess, but that's somehow what makes it so damn fun."], "rating": ["3.5/5", "3.5/5", "3.5/5", "", "4/5", "", "5/5", "2/4", "B-", "", "3.5/5", "3.5/5", "", "3.5/4", "D+", "3/4", "2/5", "4/5", "3/5", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Leigh Paatsch", "Nick Rogers", "Allison Rose", "Anne Cohen", "Nell Minow", "", "Rob Gonsalves", "Joe Lozito", "Scott Mendelson", "Nigel Floyd", "Ron Wells", "", "David Edelstein", "Jeffrey M.
