Highly recommended.", "Darkman is a bizarre little film that merges together horror, sci-fi, comedy, romance, drama, and action into one hell of an entertaining movie.", "Bridging the gap between action and science fiction, Darkman was groundbreaking and ahead of its time.", "", "The wild pulp adventure that prefigured Raimi's eventual direction of the Spider-Man franchise...If you've a taste for Hollywood-funded outr, Darkman is one of those rare films that fits the bill.

A sly Bruce Campbell cameo is merely icing on the cake.", "Raimi isn't effective with his actors, and the dialogue lacks smart menace, but his canny visual sense carries many a scene.", "While the film hardly works as a dramatic whole, the director's gallop through the horror sub-genres is oddly entertaining, and some of the setpieces are truly inspired."], "rating": ["4.5/5", "3.5/4", "3/4", "3/5", "", "3.5/4", "", "3/4", "4.0/5", "6/10", "3.5/4", "3/4", "4/5", "4/5", "B", "3/4", "4/5", "A-", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Nick Rogers", "David Nusair", "James Kendrick", "Heather Wixson", "Anton Bitel", "Walter Chaw", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "John Beifuss", "Noel Murray", "J.C.
