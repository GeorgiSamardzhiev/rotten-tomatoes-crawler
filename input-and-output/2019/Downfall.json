{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In 1942, young Traudl Junge (Alexandra Maria Lara) lands her dream job -- secretary to Adolf Hitler (Bruno Ganz) at the peak of his power. Three years later, Hitler's empire is now his underground bunker. The real-life Traudl narrates Hitler's final days as he rages against imagined betrayers and barks orders to phantom armies, while his mistress, Eva Braun (Juliane K\u00f6hler), clucks over his emotional distance, and other infamous Nazis prepare for the end.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "2h 34m", "director": "Oliver Hirschbiegel", "studio": "RaiCinema,\u00d6sterreichischerRundfunk(ORF)[at],ConstantinFilmProduktion,DegetoFilm,EOSEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 4, 2017", "box_office": "$5.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Most impressive of all is how, with the world closing in on the ranting, paranoid monster, Ganz ratchets down his performance from towering to cowering in minute increments.", "It asks a great deal of indulgence from its audience, almost as though nothing less than an endurance test would do in dealing with this heavyweight subject.

Yes, and it should: to pretend these villains were less than human is to let ourselves off the hook, to take the easy and dangerous exit of demonology.", "\"Downfall\" isn't about commuting history's sentence for the Nazis, but heeding its warning - a gruesome, sustained-tension lesson about informed politics and whether those who left evil to its own devices could arrive at a place of complicit guilt.", "It's reach exceeds its grasp; nonetheless, a compelling study of Hitler's last days.", "As the first German-made film about Hitler's ruination since G.W.
