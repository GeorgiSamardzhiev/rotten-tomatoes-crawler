[Full review in Spanish]", "For Sama is a work of brilliant wonder.", "This deeply personal and intimate portrayal of lives being torn to shreds by a war on humanity is filled with horrific images that can disturb even the most stone-hearted people.", "We see the way children and parents respond to the pervasive fear, not wanting to be parted even if it is a matter of simple survival.", "It is an essential documentation of what is happening to other people in the world who are just like us, but through no fault of their own are forced into the most terrifying and impossible circumstances.", "I have rarely seen a documentary film as powerful as For Sama. The viewer is transported into the Syrian city of Aleppo to experience the very nasty civil war at first hand.", "A remarkable documentary and important contribution to a collective portrait of the Syrian tragedy...", "It's so very important that we take every opportunity we get to open the window into the world beyond our own lives to see stories like this one.", "It is confronting and occasionally shocking.

The sight of a mother processing the shock of finding her son who had just been killed by a bomb blast shows the barbarism of targeting civilians in all its casual cruelty.", "I cannot promise that this film will not upset or disturb you, but I can urge you to hold fast and watch it.", "As difficult as it can be seeing the lives of families and their children ravaged by conflict, it feels like the least we can do is take 90 minutes out to listen to their voices.", "[A] dynamic and poignantly personal account of a city's systematic destruction.", "For five years, a Syrian documentarian and her doctor husband face hell unleashed in their besieged city of Aleppo.", "Absolutely essential viewing and a testament to the power of film.", "...a singular experience... intimate and shattering... a monumentally moving testimony.", "This movie from Syria doesn't get into politics other than to ask the question, why did the nations of the world stand by and do nothing as the men, women and children of Aleppo were being slaughtered?"], "rating": ["3/5", "4/5", "", "4.0/4", "3.5/5", "", "4.5/5", "4.5/5", "", "5/5", "5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "7/10", "1", "4/5", "5/5", "5/5", "2", "B+"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Ignacio Pablo Rico", "Janire Zurbano", "Carlos Bonfil", "Richard Propes", "Shikhar Verma", "John McDonald", "Damien Straker", "David Stratton", "Robert F.
