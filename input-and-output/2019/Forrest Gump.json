{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Slow-witted Forrest Gump (Tom Hanks) has never thought of himself as disadvantaged, and thanks to his supportive mother (Sally Field), he leads anything but a restricted life. Whether dominating on the gridiron as a college football star, fighting in Vietnam or captaining a shrimp boat, Forrest inspires people with his childlike optimism. But one person Forrest cares about most may be the most difficult to save -- his childhood love, the sweet but troubled Jenny (Robin Wright).", "rating": "71", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 22m", "director": "Robert Zemeckis", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "Jul 6, 1994", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$330.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Its timelessness, poignancy, and hilarity are infectiously powerful.", "Forrest Gump may have its own problems some 26 years later but the film features one heck of a soundtrack.", "It's too specific to be a proper allegory, and too vague to provide a satisfactorily millennial perspective on the last 50 years. Neither is it caustic enough to make one cry, nor soppy enough to make one laugh.", "The narrative is so programmed it is like watching software. Forrest Gump is a medley of sound bites-clever, cute, amusing, silly, sentimental-and irritatingly phony...", "Self-ingratiatingly, and for this viewer maddeningly, it blends the comic with the Christly, the satirical with the sentimental, the free-thinking with the fuddy-duddy.", "Yes, there were better motion pictures that year -- not just Pulp Fiction but also Quiz Show and Hoop Dreams (among others) -- but that's not meant to take away from this piece's appeal.", "Forrest Gump has layers and nuances and ironies, and it's far bleaker than it is given credit for. Just because a movie is a monster hit doesn't mean it isn't interesting.", "It remains a bad movie that gets worse with age.", "I can't see how people with low I.Q.s or those who love them are in any way comforted by all this hogwash. I can easily see how such people might be offended by its smug unreality.", "Fifty years from now, Forrest Gump will probably seem hopelessly quaint, cryptic, even ridiculous. Today, however, Gump, the much talked about summer fable starring Tom Hanks, is a tonic for an age of cancerous cynicism.", "Only in America could you envision a film with the conceit of a simpleton as conduit through a swathe of that country's socio-history, and for it not to be a colossal satire.", "Contrasting Forrest's unassuming innocence with the upheavals and rancor of the times, the film is a wisely goofy commentary on the stupidity of smartness.", "Forrest Gump, the new Tom Hanks movie directed by Robert Zemeckis, is a one-of-a-kind treat.", "A hilarious, large-spirited and tender epic.", "Hanks' power as an actor makes us believe in Forrest. He also draws us into Forrest's mind and morality system. And he sets out a singular film persona who will be watched and loved as long as people embrace movies.", "...an instant classic. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Forrest Gump is, for all of it's graces, undeniably broken thanks to [its] shameless ideological manipulation of historical truths. [Full review in Spanish]", "Tries very hard to be all things to all people, and as a result fails to be anything at all.", "A weirder, darker, and better movie than its reputation suggests.", "It's a lovely and wise story told with honesty and acted out with unassuming grace. To his collection of medals, trophies and kudos, Forrest Gump should add an Oscar or two."], "rating": ["1", "4/5", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "", "2/5", "", "", "4.5/5", "4/4", "3.5/5", "", "5/10", "", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Danielle Solzman", "Leslie Felperin", "Brian D.
