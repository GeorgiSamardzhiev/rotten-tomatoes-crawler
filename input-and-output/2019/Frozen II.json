It ditches the simplicity of what boiled down to repairing a sister-sister relationship and opts instead for lofty, complicated concepts in a children's movie.", "While it's usually difficult to surpass the original, this broader, more engaging follow up to the wildly successful original speaks more to the power of togetherness than its predecessor even considered.", "Pleasant and enjoyable but unlikely to leave much of a mark.", "Disney's 'Frozen 2' far exceeds the original animated film. The character development, storyline and the overall themes are more nuanced, detailed and intriguing. There are some scenes that may insight fear in smaller kids, but overall it's kid-friendly.", "Frozen 2 brings the strenghts of the first movie and takes them further (...). It's more balanced so kids and adults can enjoy the journey. [Full review in Spanish]", "There's no question the Littles will enjoy Frozen 2. It's plenty colorful, even if it did feel long. I say \"feel long\" because it's only 103 minutes, but a lot is going on.", "Disney has managed an impressive act of tightrope walking in following up their latest golden goose with something that shimmers almost as brightly", "It's a sweet tale of sisters doing it for themselves with a melancholic hinting at how childhood's innocence gives way to the concerns of the world and their place in it.", "A beautiful and very entertaining animated sequel that makes me have a nice time for a magical hour and a half. [Full review in Spanish]", "Frozen II may sing about change, but that progress is what you project onto it.", "\"Frozen II\" is sure to please the kiddies and their parents with catchy tunes and wondrous animation, even if it makes the plot more complicated than it needs to be for its target audience.", "Frozen 2 may not warm the cockles of your heart quite to the extent that Frozen did, but it will, if you sit back and let it sweep over you, take your breath away.", "They try to throw a lot at you, but very little is focused.", "There's a whole lot of charm in this, but it follows the original's winning formula a little too closely that it feels almost repetitive.", "Although the sequel is no match with the 2013 original, \"Frozen II\" remains a decent sequel that - at least, thankfully - doesn't feel like a blatant cash grab after all.", "Frozen II is a solid follow up to a brilliant film, managing to surpass the original in a lot of ways, while also being weaker in many other ways.", "A visually marvellous work, with stunning imagery and design.", "A distressingly unnecessary (and fairly tedious) sequel...", "Frozen II is the exact kind of sequel that more film series need: it takes chances (within the framework of a Disney animated feature)...", "[A]n ultimately satisfying story of more mature themes for an audience that's grown out of the dress-up stage."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "6/10", "4/4", "8/10", "3.5/5", "4/5", "3.5/5", "7/10", "2.5/5", "3/4", "3/5", "2/4", "", "3/5", "", "8/10", "2/4", "", "3.5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Candice McMillan", "Wesley Lovell", "Mike Massie", "Lynnette Nicholas", "Jesus Agudo", "MontiLee Stormer", "Tom Beasley", "Stephen A.
