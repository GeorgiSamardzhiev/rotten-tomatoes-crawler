{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Gaston (Louis Jourdan) is a restless Parisian playboy who moves from one mistress to another, while also spending time with Gigi (Leslie Caron), a precocious younger friend learning the ways of high society. The platonic relationship between Gaston and Gigi changes, however, when she matures, but the possibility of something lasting seems unlikely since he won't commit to one woman. Gigi refuses to be anyone's mistress, however, and Gaston must choose between her and his carefree lifestyle.", "rating": "81", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Musical & Performing Arts/Romance", "runtime": "1h 56m", "director": "Vincente Minnelli", "studio": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The film does a masterful job of disguising Gigi's potential role as a prostitute (or the more acceptable term of a courtesan).", "The film would have to be much better for Caron and Jourdan's limited charisma and mediocre acting to avoid being a crushing problem.", "The excellent cast also includes Maurice Chevalier and Isabel Jeans. The songs are pleasant, although nobody in the film ever quite gets around to singing them in full voice.", "While Gigi does not represent a revival of the MGM musical in its heyday, it is a welcome extension of latter-day musical style in its adult subject-matter and its avoidance of spectacle made vulgar by emphasis on size.", "Colette's tale about the training of a schoolgirl cocotte blown up into a full-scale musical, starts things oil with a bang.", "With Louis Jourdan as the bored playboy, Maurice Chevalier a delight as the ageless Gallic rake and Leslie Caron radiating her sunny gamin charm as Gigi.", "Gigi is an enjoyable parfait - a frothy concoction that at times makes the viewer giddy - but it lacks the traits of greatness one might expect from a production so dizzyingly honored.", "Lovely to behold, but the story has dated very badly.", "With so many outstanding performances in the film, it is to Maurice Chevalier's great credit that he is able to steal the show.", "There's a fine bittersweet air to this tale that leaves you longing to see it again.", "Given the shortage of dancing and soaring vocal melodies...Minnelli must lean heavily on personality and a spectacle defined by the pageantry of historic locations, sets and costumes.
