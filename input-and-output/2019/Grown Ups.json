{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The death of their childhood basketball coach leads to a reunion for some old friends (Adam Sandler, Kevin James, Chris Rock), who gather at the site of a championship celebration years earlier.

Rats! It ruined my pretty long streak of hating all Adam Sandler movies.", "Granted, Sandler's script has one or two laughs, but it's mostly excruciating and lacks the self-mockery of, say, a Judd Apatow movie.", "Finding Grown Ups funny necessitates that one finds it inherently marvelous when fat men talk about eating, old women describe having sexual desires, and old fat women break wind.", "Grown Ups is cliched, predictable and full of immature and juvenile humor. The film recycles far too many jokes and it gets old real fast.", "Don't take it too seriously and you'll have a good time.", "The title mainly leaves one wondering when Sandler will chose to finally grow up and stop starring in this ongoing series of terrible comedies.", "", "Doesn't so much play like a film than random home movies of Sandler and his usual screen cronies on vacation.", "Five forgettable characters reunite for a (lame) joke-filled weekend.", "The second half of Grown Ups isn't good enough to dig its way out of the tremendous hole it's created for itself but it's far from the worse thing Sandler has ever made. Maybe in another 20 years he'll make something funny.", "Grown Ups is the perfect poster child for this maddening summer of movie mediocrity.", "Grown Ups heralds a sad day for comedy nostalgists of a certain age. Call it the day the amusement died.", "Surprisingly, amazingly, bafflingly uncomedic and unhilarious.", "There's almost no plot, and loads of schmaltz, but the hidden metaphors and cast chemistry makes this a worthwhile effort.", "The shameless sentiment (a cute little girl wants to use the car GPS to locate heaven) and Sandler's ego-tripping (he's married to Salma Hayek, and he's a sure shot on the basketball court) interfere with the laughs.", "Despite some passable gags and a whole posse of middle-aged funnymen, Denis Dugan's comedy is about the least grown-up movie you could see.", "Not much more than an in-joke between the actors, this film is amiable but never funny. And despite some hackneyed moralising, it has nothing to say.", "You've seen these actors play these characters many times before, and better."], "rating": ["3/10", "3.5/4", "3/5", "1/5", "2/10", "5/10", "6/10", "1.5/4", "D", "1.5/4", "", "5/10", "2/4", "2/4", "1/5", "7/10", "2/4", "1/5", "2/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Carey-Ann Pawsey", "Anna Smith", "Tim Brayton", "Matt Joseph", "Jeffrey Lyles", "Jeff Beck", "Nell Minow", "Michael Dequina", "Sarah Sluis", "Joshua Starnes", "Rene Rodriguez", "Mike Scott", "Matt Neal", "R.L.
