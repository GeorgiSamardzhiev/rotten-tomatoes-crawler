Erik runs away from home and encounters the Mighty Sven (Hank Azaria) -- a penguin that can fly. Poor Mumble can't compete with Erik's unusual new role model. But, when the world is shaken by powerful forces, Erik gets a chance to see his father's true colors as Mumble gathers all creatures great and small to set things right again.", "rating": "45", "genre": "Animation/Art House & International/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "George Miller", "studio": "KennedyMillerMitchell", "theater_date": "Nov 18, 2011", "dvd_date": "Dec 1, 2013", "box_office": "$64.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Will have you mumbling along with Mumbles, Gloria, and their new son Erik as you and your kids leave the theatre.", "I was a fan of that original, but this one is pointless.
