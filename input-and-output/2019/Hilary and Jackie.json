{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Iris Du Pr\u00e9 (Celia Imrie) inspires a love of music -- and a healthy rivalry -- in her daughters, Hilary (Rachel Griffiths) and Jackie (Emily Watson). Cellist Jackie outshines her flutist sister when her skillful playing lands her in the international spotlight. Meanwhile, Hilary builds a quiet but happy family life. When Jackie buckles under mounting pressures in the high-stress world of elite classical musicians, she turns to Hilary for help, and may put her sister's love to the test.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 4m", "director": "", "studio": "IntermediaFilms,ArtsCouncilofEngland,BritishScreenProductions,ChannelFourFilms", "theater_date": "Jan 15, 1999", "dvd_date": "Feb 12, 2014", "box_office": "$4.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Told from both women's points of view, this fascinating, if sometimes overwrought, tale packs a wallop.
