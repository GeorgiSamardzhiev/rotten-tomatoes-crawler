Unable to dramatize marital love, he sells it, as if he were pitching perfume. Having nothing credible to play, Moore and Harrelson strike poses of love and anguish.", "In some ways, this portentous little morality tale about the dangerous powers of great wealth might be taken in as an amusing evening of unintentionally campy stuff, except that it unfolds glacially at times. The performances are universally embarrassing.", "I don't know if the film insults women, but it certainly insults its audience.", "'90s romantic drama has some explicit sex, profanity.", "Painfully disengaged from anything human.", "...glossy and soap-opera-like...", "", "Although it was directed by Fatal Attraction auteur Adrian Lyne, this film lacked the punch and thriller elements that made that one a hit", "Yes, it's true: in this astonishingly distasteful bit of dreck, there is at the bottom a sappy little romance.", "A film that is at times laughable yet at the same time, over 15 years after its release, its premise is still up for debate and discussion.", "Would you sell your body for a night, to the tune of a million dollars?
