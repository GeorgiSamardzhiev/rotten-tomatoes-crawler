{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When flight attendant Jackie Brown (Pam Grier) is busted smuggling money for her arms dealer boss, Ordell Robbie (Samuel L. Jackson), agent Ray Nicolette (Michael Keaton) and detective Mark Dargus (Michael Bowen) want her help to bring down Robbie. Facing jail time for her silence or death for her cooperation, Brown decides instead to double-cross both parties and make off with the smuggled money. Meanwhile, she enlists the help of bondsman Max Cherry (Robert Forster), a man who loves her.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 35m", "director": "Quentin Tarantino", "studio": "MightyMightyAfroditeProductions,ABandApart,LawrenceBenderProductions,MiramaxFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 17, 2015", "box_office": "$39.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["[Quentin] Tarantino knows his way around a script, but this is something special that goes beyond witty dialogue.", "Grace is all about second chances, so from that perspective, Jackie Brown is a film filled with grace.", "We need more referents like her. Superheroine, superwoman. Thus spoke Zarathustra; This is how Nietzsche described it. [Full review in Spanish]", "A twisty comedy of betrayal and greed.", "Surprisingly, Tarantino displays less confidence assembling it than he did in the earlier film. At more than two hours, it's simply too long, or at least it seems so.", "'Jackie Brown' may be the only Quentin Tarantino movie that gets noticeably better with each viewing.", "Pam Grier is at her best recapturing the type of role that made her a bonafide star in '70s blaxploitation movies like Foxy Brown...", "Pam Grier's entrance in her retro stewardess outfit introduces the kick-ass star of Foxy Brown and Friday Foster gracefully aging into the modern world.", "Quentin Tarantino had a lot to live up to with this release and while he has not made a movie that has matched his previous successes, Jackie Brown is still a great film.", "It's slow, it's sad and it's very funny in ways that don't really revolve around punchlines. It's about characters who have been around the block one too many times and they're exhausted, full of dreams deferred, just trying to scrape by.", "While Jackie Brown can be too languid, drifting like one of Melanie's highs, its wearied, over-40 lows reveal Tarantino as a director who, once upon a crime, could've mined complexity and depth from the cracks and crevices of American genre movies.", "A much moodier, slower pace from Tarantino's other work, but Jackie Brown is one enjoyable flick that rewards its audience with each viewing.", "might be his best film", "Succeeds as a witty Elmore Leonard crime story...but also as a surprisingly affecting mid-life romance. [Blu-ray]", "Tarantino's films aren't so much stories as strings of anecdotes: movie moments, urban myths, conversations strewn with pop culture references.", "Mellower Tarantino still has sex, drugs, swearing, murder.", "Loaded with all the crisp dialogue, trademark camera work, and memorable characters that we've come to expect from every Tarantino film.", "Consider it a superb Elmore Leonard adaptation by a filmmaker who knows how to serve someone else's material while making it his own.", "The tale is filled with funny, gritty Tarantino lowlife gab and a respectable body count, but what is most striking is the film's gallantry and sweetness.", "Quentin Tarantino puts together a fairly intricate and relatively uninvolving money-smuggling plot, but his cast is so good that you probably won't feel cheated."], "rating": ["4/4", "", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "A", "", "4/5", "", "", "9/10", "4/4", "3.5/4", "", "3/5", "4/5", "5/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tom Meek", "Ed Travis", "Guillem Martinez Oya", "Michael Wilmington", "Jay Carr", "Jason Bailey", "Candice Frederick", "Sean Axmaker", "Matthew Pejkovic", "Sean Burns", "Brian Gibson", "R.L.
