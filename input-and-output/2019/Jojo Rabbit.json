More importantly, it's a pro-love movie.", "Is Waititi's film provocative? Yes. Silly? Undeniably. But it is also surprisingly tender and moving.", "Humorous, touching, and devastating in equal measure.", "It's worth seeing, however-particularly for Sam Rockwell, who adds to his gallery of great supporting performances with a turn as a disillusioned Axis army captain that nearly steals the film whole...", "Jojo Rabbit knows when it has to get emotional, and that is way better than its comedy. [Full review in Spanish]", "Both heart-rending and hilarious with a dash of horror elements, Jojo Rabbit is easily one of the year's best films.", "Jojo Rabbit combines Quentin Tarantino and Wes Anderson in the worst, cop-out ways.", "One of my absolute favorite films of 2019.", "Taika Waititi (\"Thor: Ragnarok\") directs this black comedy about a boy in the Hitler Youth who learns his mom (Scarlett Johansson) is hiding a Jewish girl in their home.", "Taika achieves the impossible, balancing an enjoyable mix between satirical comedy, heartfelt sentiment and poignancy.", "While it's often very pleasant an experience to witness unfold, you're left with the sense that there's just not quite enough conviction in it to make the more emotional moments have much lasting resonance.", "...he has taken a seriously misguided path, creating a work that inadvertently or not trivializes Nazism and turns people away from a study of the concrete historical processes that produced such horrific carnage.", "Consistently funny, but also consistently poignant, layered with meaning and sneakily feminist.", "Jojo Rabbit is a beautiful fairy tale of a story. It's set amid one of the most horrific periods of world history, but the gas chambers and concentration camps are nowhere to be seen.", "This is a satire that's too afraid to put anyone off, and the result is surprisingly anodyne.", "Whilst you might feel some apprehension about the concept of a 10-year-old boy who has Hitler as an imaginary friend, Taika Waititi has turned it into something brilliant and poignant.", "As Jojo's world opens up and ruptures, the film morphs from a kicky comedy to an almost genre-defying journey.", "Taika Waititi reminds us that love is the most powerful tool we have to battle hate. [Full review in Spanish]", "It's a fabulous satire on World War II that moves me when it condemns hatred and dehumanization in times of belligerence to celebrate love, friendship, and rediscovery.
