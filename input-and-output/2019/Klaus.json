You will alternate between laughing and being moved by the film.", "Klaus has a simple message we would all do well to remember: \"A true selfless act always sparks another.\"", "Klaus is the surprise of this awards season. [Full review in Spanish]", "Beyond the approachable storytelling, fun cast, and revisionist mythology, however, lies the stunning craftsmanship of the animation itself.", "Instead, it's a clever, not-too-sentimental Hatfields v McCoys take on the legend of Santa Claus.", "An engaging revisionist tale, destined to become another Christmas classic.", "While Klaus has a number of the same faults you'll find in a number of run-of-the-mill animated family movies . . . , more animated works could stand to take a cue from its visual creativity.", "A cut above the average seasonal tale due to its impressive cast and visual inventiveness, this film is full of unexpected references which will entertain older viewers but don't get in the way of the plot.", "The fluidity, the smoothness of the 3D animation...people, it looks good, incredible.", "This should be eligible for Best Animated Picture.", "Destined to be added to the yearly holiday viewing rotation, Klaus is worth writing to Santa about.", "The animation is beautiful, the story is beautiful, the music is beautiful.", "Sure you know where the story is going, but the journey is delightful nonetheless.", "Essentially a heartwarming tale of a millennial entrepreneur disrupting the status quo through social enterprise, Klaus is a pure pleasure to watch.", "Although Klaus takes a while for its story to get interesting, it is saved by its breathtaking animation and emotional message at its core.", "Its tempo is uneven, and not all characters convincing, yet Klaus relies mostly on storytelling and a back-to-basics visual style to achieve its aim rather than marketing sensibilities."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "", "B+", "", "4/5", "3.5/5", "", "8/10", "3.5", "8/10", "", "3.5/5", "", "", "B+", "", "3.5/5", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Wesley Lovell", "Ricardo Gallegos", "Allen Almachar", "Ruhaan Shah", "Carey-Ann Pawsey", "Karen Rought", "Pablo O.
