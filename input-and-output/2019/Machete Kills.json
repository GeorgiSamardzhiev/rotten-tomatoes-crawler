{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When the president (Carlos Estevez) of the United States has a mission that would be impossible for just any mortal man, the person he needs is Machete (Danny Trejo), a knife-wielding ex-Federale agent. Machete's mission is to take down Voz (Mel Gibson), a madman revolutionary and an eccentric billionaire arms dealer who has come up with a plot to start a nuclear war. Facing death at every turn from assassins, Machete pulls out all of his skills to get the job done.", "rating": "29", "genre": "Action & Adventure", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Robert Rodriguez", "studio": "QuickDraw", "theater_date": "Oct 11, 2013", "dvd_date": "Dec 9, 2015", "box_office": "$7.9M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Trejo oozes grindhouse cool, but the movie itself commits an exploitation film sin - it's dull.", "The dialogue fluctuates between self-reflective hilarity and just plain cringe-worthy.", "A sequel to a film that was based upon a trailer.", "\"Machete Kills\" takes on the madman taking over the world sub genre favored by middle-era James Bond films, mixes that with an excess of \"Star Wars\" jokes, and concocts a bland caricature.", "I \"get\" grind-schlock. This isn't that, this is someone doing a bad impression of that.", "The appeal of Rodriguez's '70s grindhouse influenced films like Machete Kills is bound to wear thin one day, but not today.", "A completely absurd tongue-in-cheek action film that evenly distributes the laughs and the body count", "The cameos are distracting, the plot loses its rhythm before disintegrating completely and the seemingly endless decapitations and brutal deaths will lead even the most hardened of action fans to seek religion after the credits roll.", "Takes the seedy locales of a Mexploitation movie ... and creates an atmospheric beauty, establishing a neon serenity as a prelude to roadside carnage.", "Bigger, more ambitious, and more raucous, Machete Kills stands as a film that proves more can, sometimes, be less.", "Maybe... 'neo-grindhouse' has become a 'genre' because Tarantino's Midas touch turned grindhouse into ... art? Grindhouse sort of sounds like 'art house.' On the other hand-nah.", "The stunt casting is so poorly realized that actors pop in and out of the film at random, the story apparently stitched together according to actors' schedules.", "\"Machete will return in: Machete Kills!\" boomed the gritty voiceover dude at the end of Robert Rodriguez's 2010 Mexploitation parody. Three years later, we're reminded that it was a threat, not a promise.", "Everything looks artificial and achieved in post-production. Every shortcut is met to save money on budget and time.", "Danny Trejo is as far from stale whitebread as you can get. He's the real deal.", "An absolutely absurd action extravaganza. It's doubly crazy, chaotic and all kinds of ridiculous fun.", "The meta parody of Machete Kills is a self-congratulating exercise in overkill. Its onslaught of gags try so hard to be outrageous they become banal. It looks like it was way more fun to make than to watch.", "If nothing else, Robert Rodriguez's Grindhouse homage manages the herculean feat of making us feel sorry for Mel Gibson.", "'Machete Kills' is 'Spy Kids' Meets 'Moonraker'... with Blood.
