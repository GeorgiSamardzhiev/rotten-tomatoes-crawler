{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Depressed and jaded after being dumped by her married boyfriend, aging beauty Minnie Moore (Gena Rowlands) wonders if she'll ever find love. After shaggy-haired parking lot attendant Seymour Moskowitz (Seymour Cassel) comes to her defense from an angry and rebuffed blind date, he falls hopelessly in love with her despite their myriad differences. Minnie reluctantly agrees to a date with Moskowitz, and, slowly but surely, an unlikely romance blossoms between the two.", "rating": "80", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 54m", "director": "John Cassavetes", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The nicest thing about [Minnie and Moskowitz] is its refusal to generalize or to impose a meaning on the humble, familiar people it makes us care so much about.", "[John] Cassavetes injected elements of his own relationship with [Gena] Rowlands into Minnie and Moskowitz's odd courtship, and despite the characters seeming incompatibility, their union is finally credible and touching.", "John Cassavetes built this movie on a small conceit -- a love affair between two people who are wildly unsuited to each other -- and it doesn't take root.", "The sculptural physicality of the images, a 3-D explosion without glasses, embodies that violence while preserving the antagonists' innocent grace; love smooths things out to a dreamy and reflective shine.", "Zany character portrayal of two lonely thirtysomething misfits who are opposites but nevertheless find romance together despite many obstacles in their path.", "", "The most accessible, and endearing example of his very exceptional art.", "", "", "The fact is that although I admired specific things about the film, I never laughed very much and only felt slight, distant tremors of the joy that, I assume, rocked everyone connected with the movie during its production.", "The movie is sort of a fairy tale, Cassavetes says; it's dedicated to all the people who didn't marry the person they should have.
