{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this beloved musical, pompous phonetics professor Henry Higgins (Rex Harrison) is so sure of his abilities that he takes it upon himself to transform a Cockney working-class girl into someone who can pass for a cultured member of high society. His subject turns out to be the lovely Eliza Doolittle (Audrey Hepburn), who agrees to speech lessons to improve her job prospects. Higgins and Eliza clash, then form an unlikely bond -- one that is threatened by an aristocratic suitor (Jeremy Brett).", "rating": "95", "genre": "Kids & Family/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "2h 50m", "director": "George Cukor", "studio": "WarnerBrothers", "theater_date": "Dec 25, 1964", "dvd_date": "Nov 9, 2020", "box_office": "$447.6K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's Lerner and Loewe's music that is really at the heart of the production.", "My Fair Lady encompasses everything that make musicals great - wit, charm, grace, humor, and a touch of magical realism.", "It's all sufficiently enjoyable too. One does go 'Ooh!' at the photography, and enough people probably go 'Ooh!' at the costumes.", "Over half-a-century later, My Fair Lady remains one of the most delightful entertainments of its era.", "Perhaps any musical loses its charm, its wit, its very shape when it is enormously enlarged on the screen, but I can't believe it couldn't be managed better than this.", "There are other good things to be said about the picture, but it fails in the one really crucial area. A musical that doesn't communicate physical joy is as pointless, it seems to me, as a tragedy that fails to communicate sadness.", "Mr Alan Jay Lerner has done a brilliant screenplay from his own brilliant stage play.", "George Cukor does a fine job directing the film with an ease and flow and an incredible attention to detail.", "If this particular Eliza has so much feeling that the prettiness almost overbalances, well, that I think is a bonus.", "It's such a classic story that stiffness in the staging and direction really doesn't matter. Rex Harrison's booming star power and Audrey Hepburn's adorable face propel things along well next to the fantastic score.", "It works fine. It works no better than that, is all.", "One of those rare, rare occasions when everything goes right, when it keeps going right and it moves and takes the spectator along, enchanted and enthralled.", "The well-nigh-irresistible...My Fair Lady...comedically softens Shaw's ending but nevertheless nearly single-handedly transcends the material's sexist leaning through the sheer humanism of Hepburn's deeply felt performance. [Blu-ray]", "Despite a somewhat flawed and erratic third act, My Fair Lady rises on the strength of its lush costumes and settings, as well as several great and memorable songs, turning this into a musical that one can't help but enjoy in all of its grandeur.", "For those who've seen the stage show, My Fair Lady give complete satisfaction and those who will see and hear the musical for the first time will be enchanted by it.", "In this literal, beautiful, bountiful version of the most gilt-edged attraction in theater history, Jack Warner has miraculously managed to turn gold into gold.", "Great story, great music, awful ending.", "With elegance and taste, George Cukor rightly preserves the theatricality of the enterprise and provides a joyful experience to savour again and again.", "Even if the story is quite simple, the film, as directed by the legendary George Cukor, achieves various levels of depth, particularly because of the way in which he turns it into a keen gender study.", "Stylised and stylish, there's something gloriously timeless about My Fair Lady."], "rating": ["8/10", "", "", "", "", "", "", "A", "", "5/5", "3/5", "", "4/4", "3.5/5", "4/4", "", "B+", "5/5", "9/10", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Allen Almachar", "J.H.
