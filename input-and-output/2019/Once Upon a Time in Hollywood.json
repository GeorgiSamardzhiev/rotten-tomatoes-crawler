{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Actor Rick Dalton gained fame and fortune by starring in a 1950s television Western, but is now struggling to find meaningful work in a Hollywood that he doesn't recognize anymore. He spends most of his time drinking and palling around with Cliff Booth, his easygoing best friend and longtime stunt double. Rick also happens to live next door to Roman Polanski and Sharon Tate -- the filmmaker and budding actress whose futures will forever be altered by members of the Manson Family.", "rating": "85", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h 39m", "director": "Quentin Tarantino", "studio": "HeydayFilms,BonaFilmGroup,ColumbiaPictures", "theater_date": "Jul 26, 2019", "dvd_date": "Aug 27, 2019", "box_office": "$142.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["I was surprised by how emotionally moved I was by the way Tarantino handles [this].", "Specific in it's setting but universal in portrayal of how people react to the shifting sands of time. Funny, sad and occasionally outrageous, it's just like real life as filtered through a camera lens.", "Quentin Tarantino at his most tender.", "Clearly, Tarantino designed this movie for himself, getting to dabble in genres he enjoys and surrounding himself with memorabilia from the past.", "The film's final act descends into an orgy of gratuitous violence and nonsensical occurrences that it leaves a sour taste, as the director winds up insulting the audience as well as the real-life figures portrayed in the movie.", "Once Upon A Time In Hollywood is definitely a fun watch. It's got action, humor, drama, ridiculous situations and outrageous performances. Staples of a Tarantino movie to be honest.", "This is Tarantino's love letter to the movies and the way they were back in the day. Brad Pitt has never been better and the hypnotic ending is pure exhilaration.", "Damn, I love this movie.", "For what it's worth, its ponderous approach makes it a surprise departure from Tarantino's typically ultraviolent filmography. However, it still doesn't reach the same heights as Jackie Brown or Pulp Fiction.", "Tarrantino has a way of satisfying our desire for revenge against historical injustices. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Magically weaves together fact and fiction, stark realism with hallucinogenic fantasy to tell a story that is so complex and layered that it demands multiple views.", "A shaggy dog story wrapped in a fairytale...Tarantino respects the Chekhovian rule that if you show a flamethrower earlier in the movie, you have to use it later.", "Once Upon a Time...in Hollywood showcases the best and worst of Tarantino.", "A pure celebration to the Golden Age of Hollywood and all of Tarantino's experiences from film making. [Full review in Spanish]", "Channelling the emotional heft of Tarantino's undervalued Jackie Brown, Once Upon a Time is a beautifully melancholic movie that signals the end of an era for the Golden Age of Hollywood.", "Overall, Once Upon a Time is an extremely confused film in a tremendously confused body of work. It remains the job of the critic to try and sort through the disorder.", "Great leading performances and wonderful chemistry between Leonardo DiCaprio and Brad Pitt elevate Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, creating a thoughtful, tantalizing glimpse at the Hollywood of yesteryear and what might have been.", "[I]t often lacks purpose, gravitating towards the easiest targets without commenting enough on the times. It just fetishizes nostalgia instead.", "The nightmares of American history can be replaced, if only for a little while, with the dreams of American movies, and the cult of Hollywood emerges as powerful as ever.", "\"Once Upon a Time in Hollywood\" is a departure from Tarantino's flashier work, showing a more mature, contemplative side to the hyper cinephile. ...
