{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When Randle Patrick McMurphy (Jack Nicholson) gets transferred for evaluation from a prison farm to a mental institution, he assumes it will be a less restrictive environment. But the martinet Nurse Ratched (Louise Fletcher) runs the psychiatric ward with an iron fist, keeping her patients cowed through abuse, medication and sessions of electroconvulsive therapy. The battle of wills between the rebellious McMurphy and the inflexible Ratched soon affects all the ward's patients.", "rating": "94", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h 13m", "director": "Milos Forman", "studio": "FantasyFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This remains one of the greatest films of all time for its tonally perfect examination of power, authoritarianism, oppression, mental illness, morality and more.", "It is American filmmaking at its absolutely finest.", "Many scenes are alternatingly hopeful, hilarious, horrendous, or momentous, which varyingly amplifies the heartbreaking, powerhouse finale.", "When the people in positions of power can't be trusted and the country is reeling from a controversial war, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest rang as the voice of a generation.", "It's one of the year's best.", "As good an example as you'll ever find of socially acceptable anti-social cinema.", "Forman has lost nothing of his skills since the Fireman's Ball, his last film in Czechoslovakia, and Taking Off, his first in the United States.", "...a rigged narrative which feeds an instinct both for clear-eyed anarchy and for gross sentimentality. Nicholson's easy looseness helps to humanize the revolutionary motif, but nothing can redeem the film's eagerness to be a big, \"haunting\" poetic...", "What Forman achieves with most consistent success in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest... are the group portraits -- the scenes of inmates embarking on some joint enterprise of liberating madness.", "The supporting players, working as a repertory group, are so perfectly cast and so perfectly attuned as actors that it is impossible to find a false note.", "It could be said that the film is Jack Nicholson, with his incredible range from humor to drama, from pure physical pain to anguish or melancholy. Everything in him is alive, transparent. [Full Review in Spanish]", "A film has to be able to stand on its own legs, separate from the work that inspires it, or not at all. Cuckoo's Nest rears back and lets its lifeblood flow.", "With One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Forman takes his rightful place as one of our most creative young directors. His casting is inspired, his sense of milieu is assured, and he could probably wring Academy Award performances from a stone.", "A movie with its foundations missing.", "Equally superb as a comedy, a drama and a social critique, the picture sports the added treat of boasting a wide variety of soon-to-be familiar faces in the supporting ranks.", "The sexual politics have dated, yet conversely, Cuckoo's overlap with Michel Foucault's ideas on the construction and socio-political appropriation of madness remains potent and urgent.", "It's not just Nicholson's performance that makes this film a masterpiece; it's the fact that Forman was able to prevent that performance from capsizing the whole enterprise.", "Whatever you make of the counterculture sentimentalism in the film's story of a rebellious mental patient, [Nicholson's] performance is superb, a showcase both for his wolfish glints and for his more subtle abilities.", "Nicholson captures all the daredevil rebel spirit of Randle P. McMurphy, a prisoner who is transferred to a state mental institution.", "Watching this again, I am less inclined to regard Nurse Ratched as a simple villain, despite her vindictive humiliation of poor, shy Billy, and more like a professional who refuses to be bullied by a bunch of men."], "rating": ["5/5", "4.0/4", "1", "", "", "3.5/5", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "4/4", "5/5", "5/5", "4/5", "5/5", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Matt Neal", "Richard Propes", "Mike Massie", "Allen Almachar", "David A.
