Over the Top isn't about arm wrestling; it's about a father reconnecting with his son, and teaching him what it means to fail, and how to do it with dignity. It's beautiful actually. \"The world meets nobody half way.\"", "The grapple scenes are so devoid of thrills that you long to return to the mushy melodramatics.", "The film is on the long side for its story, as it's basically an unassuming little tug-of-love tale. But you'll be cheering for Sly on both custody and arm-wrestling fronts at the artfully-staged finale.", "Arm wrestling, truck driving, weird weight lifting, and tear jerking are the stuff of this predictable Sylvester Stallone vehicle...", "It's a technique that gives new meaning to the term ''feeling had.''", "The only diversion is keeping track of the shameless advertising plugs that dot the film, like toadstools after a rain.", "The way to a kid's heart is through his daddy's biceps, though this big daddy looks more like terminal Dada.", "Granted that it's his ticket to riches, but you'd think that by now even Sylvester Stallone might be bored playing underdogs who beat the odds and become winners.", "It's not traditionally considered a Stallone masterpiece, but I sure as hell love it.", "It's clich-ridden, wildly incompetent, and laughably serious about itself. But if you saw it at the right age, and if you approach it in the right frame of mind, it's a pretty easy way to kill a couple of hours on TBS.", "Cheesy but fun '80s action movie has violence, bullying.", "Routinely made in every respect.", "", "Inevitably there is a bicep-bursting climax in Vegas, and even though he does wear clip-on ties, it is impossible not to root for the New Yorkie Bar man.", "Why draw the line between \"so bad it's good\" and a pedigreed artistic success?", "", "", "Stallone gives an impressive performance", "Poor Sly! He doesn't even know if his last name is Hawk or Hawks!", "Mesmo que o roteiro insista em solues fceis e pouco verossmeis e que o clmax seja prejudicado pelo pouco potencial cinematogrfico de um campeonato de queda-de-brao, Stallone envolve o espectador com seu carisma habitual."], "rating": ["7.5/10", "2/5", "3/5", "1/5", "2/4", "", "", "1/4", "", "", "3/5", "", "2/5", "", "4/4", "1/5", "2/5", "3/5", "1/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Lee McCoy", "David Parkinson", "Sky Staff", "TV Guide Staff", "Dave Kehr", "Sheila Benson", "Pat Graham", "William Wolf", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Jason Bailey", "Brian Costello", "Variety Staff", "Susan Granger", "Mark Sanderson", "Phil Villarreal", "Emanuel Levy", "Robert Roten", "Caffeinated Clint", "Michael A.
