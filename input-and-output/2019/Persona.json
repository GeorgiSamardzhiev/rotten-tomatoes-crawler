{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Famed stage stress Elisabeth Vogler (Liv Ullmann) suffers a moment of blankness during a performance and the next day lapses into total silence. Advised by her doctor to take time off to recover from what appears to be an emotional breakdown, Elisabeth goes to a beach house on the Baltic Sea with only Anna (Bibi Andersson), a nurse, as company. Over the next several weeks, as Anna struggles to reach her mute patient, the two women find themselves experiencing a strange emotional convergence.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 21m", "director": "Ingmar Bergman", "studio": "SvenskFilmindustri", "theater_date": "Mar 6, 1967", "dvd_date": "Mar 11, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There are so many threads... in this extraordinary, tantalising film that it ts impossible to give precise directions: more perhaps than any other film in the history of the cinema, it is a treasure trove in which each must seek his own jewels.", "This original and individual work acts upon us in its own way; what is finally impossible to escape are the faces of Bibi Andersson and Liv Ullmann, agonized objects of Bergman's worship.", "[T]hose affecting scenes linger still in the mind. Though products of manipulation, the emotions are real. Cinema speaks in spite of itself-and in spite of Bergman.", "Completely exhausted the medium's potential in one staggering blaze of monochromatic glory.", "The ambiguous nature of this work discussing identity, modernity and duality, alongside its technical feats in cinematography allow it to be an expansive platform for discussion and analysis.", "Certainly Persona is Bergman's most concentrated work, in a sense a summation of the themes dominant in most of his previous films; and it is undeniably a difficult film, if only because it leaves itself open to so many interpretations.", "Whether the film's ambiguous meanings strike you as profound or overblown, there's greatness enough in its aesthetic marvels: the power of its performances, the beauty of its images and the deftness of its sudden shifts.", "Hardcore surrealism is rarely this enjoyable.", "It remains as mysterious and troubling now as it ever was.", "[Bergman] gives us a movie within a movie, but he seems hardly to have made the enclosing movie, and then he throws away the inner one.", "Maybe one's quarrel with Bergman has to do with a feeling that even austerity begins to look like a special kind of emotional self-indulgence.", "This is the ultimate celluloid Rorschach test, where the production refuses to offer a straightforward solution to the maze of thorny challenges.", "One of the most complicated and radical films even Bergman ever made.", "[...]Persona marks a radical break for Bergman, an acknowledgment up front of the illusion and fundamental artifice of making movies.", "The intimacy and the intensity of the camera's focus and the increasingly naked confessions and accusations in the dialogue create one of the most intense character pieces put on film.", "Persona probes the depths of the human psyche, even as it examines the ways in which people tell stories and create new realities. Its themes are timeless, and it still holds up today.", "One of the screen's supreme works and perhaps Ingmar Bergman's finest film.", "One is forced to spend much more time in examining these women than in getting to understand them. They are treated as objects not subjects -- an attitude which, whether intentionally or not, is relevant to contemporary corruption.", "Wonderfully complex but warmly human, Bergman's drama is one of his very best.", "[A] masterpiece."], "rating": ["", "", "", "5/5", "", "", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "", "", "5/5", "", "4.5/5", "", "4/5", "4/4", "", "5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tom Milne", "Robert Kotlowitz", "CJ Sheu", "Tim Brayton", "Chloe Leeson", "David Wilson", "Edward Porter", "David Jenkins", "Geoffrey Macnab", "Pauline Kael", "Penelope Houston", "Phil Hall", "Derek Malcolm", "Scott Tobias", "Sean Axmaker", "Eric Melin", "Michael Wilmington", "Robert Hatch", "David Parkinson", "J.
