No one ever made being bored look so exciting, and the effortlessly graceful and impossibly hip actor gave the mid-'60s nouvelle vague a needed macho punch.", "Few would deny that Pierrot Le Fou is [Godard's] most innovative, iconoclast, and subversive film to date.", "The melodramatic sluice-of-life interludes are what ultimately swamp the film's modest blend of whimsy and melancholy.", "Of the Godardian '60s, this effervescent, self-mocking, effortlessly iconic masterpiece may be the filmmaker's quintessential work.", "As with many other Godard films, I didn't like Pierrot le Fou the first time I saw it, but it stuck with me, and months later, I couldn't wait to see it again. Now I believe it's a masterpiece.", "Pierrot is a self conscious mash up of every movie genre that Godard loves, of every movie he has made, of all the artistic references (music, painting, literature) that have influenced or affected him", "An idiosyncratic work by a filmmaker trotting out his obsessions of the moment and committing them to film without much regard for actual meaning.", "And then theres the color. As much as anything, \"Pierrot\" is a film about red and blue, as well as a little bit of yellow and green.", "Theirs is, in their own words, 'A story,' 'All mixed up,' and their self-construction mimics that of their true Creator, the ever-experimental auteur Jean-Luc Godard. [Blu-ray]", "At its worst, in some of its improvised rambles, it demonstrates the value of a well-thought-out screenplay. At its exhilarating and poignant best, it proves that a film can play all sorts of postmodern games yet still touch its viewers' emotions.", "This sparkling, anarchic 1965 thriller is vintage Godard.", "A wild-eyed, everything-in-the-pot cross-processing of artistic, cinematic, political and personal concerns, where the story stutters, splinters and infuriates its way to an explosive finale.", "An eye-poppingly vivid exercise in genre-busting filmmaking. Here is one of the most persistently intriguing directors of the 1960s at his most watchable and entertaining.", "Godard opens up his box of tricks and tips it all over the screen in a flurry of improvised, postmodernism that takes scattergun shots at consumerism, cultural imperialism and the Vietnam and Algerian wars."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "3/4", "4.5/5", "", "", "4/5", "A", "", "", "", "", "7", "4.5/5", "1", "3.5/4", "4/5", "", "5/5", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["James Kendrick", "Matt Brunson", "Michael J.
