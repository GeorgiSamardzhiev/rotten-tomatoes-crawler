Whatever area the fights take place in, everything in the vicinity will be used to fight with; whether it's a shoe, two small steps, or a sock - Chan will find a way to use them creatively during the fight.", "It's the joy of watching Chan, a Buster Keaton of kickboxing, hurling himself into every stunt with total commitment, astounding athleticism and oddly unflappable, shaggy-haired grace.", "In Police Story, Chan is able to highlight all of his gifts as an action star, a comedic star, and as a director balancing the two.", "...[shows] writer-director-star Jackie Chan in his finest fighting style -- along with his usual over mugging for the camera.", "[Chan's] impeccable sense for how to stage a sequence extends to simple conversations, and the films are built around what's possible in terms of action rather than filling in action to support the plot.", "Featuring cinema's best bus-related stunt sequence, a spectacular finale in a shopping mall and, um, multiple instances of its star getting hit in the face with cake.", "Just as good as the fights though are Police Story's comic set pieces, especially one totally unrelated to any kind of plot development, which finds Chan alone in the precinct office as everyone else goes to lunch.", "Chan seems to do everything he can think of to ingratiate himself with viewers.", "One of the great 1980s action films. It's also one of the most 1980s action films.", "The likeable and graceful Chan directs, sings and performs jaw-dropping stunts.
