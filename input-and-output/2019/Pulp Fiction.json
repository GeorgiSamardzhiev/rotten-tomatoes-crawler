{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Vincent Vega (John Travolta) and Jules Winnfield (Samuel L. Jackson) are hitmen with a penchant for philosophical discussions. In this ultra-hip, multi-strand crime movie, their storyline is interwoven with those of their boss, gangster Marsellus Wallace (Ving Rhames) ; his actress wife, Mia (Uma Thurman) ; struggling boxer Butch Coolidge (Bruce Willis) ; master fixer Winston Wolfe (Harvey Keitel) and a nervous pair of armed robbers, \"Pumpkin\" (Tim Roth) and \"Honey Bunny\" (Amanda Plummer).", "rating": "92", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 33m", "director": "Quentin Tarantino", "studio": "ABandApart,MiramaxFilms,JerseyFilms", "theater_date": "Oct 14, 1994", "dvd_date": "Apr 21, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A seminal piece of filmmaking, perfectly capturing its era and a zeitgeist, while also being oddly timeless in terms of its neo-crime, post modern, darkly comic approach.", "Staying true to the pulp magazine source material, plenty of drugs, alcohol, sex, nudity, cursing, violence, and all manner of criminal elements are included.", "Quentin Tarantino was able to take the films that influenced him and create something wholly his own, in turn influencing a generation of young filmmakers.", "Understandably, some elements of Pulp Fiction have not stood the test of time.", "Quentin Tarantino's retro-fetishism was the future of American cinema.", "Pulp Fiction actually uses its non-linear story telling structure to hinge its entire complex narrative around one man's redemption in light of a divine intervention.", "Pulp Fiction (1994) brought director Quentin Tarantino, a B-movie fanatic and ex-video store clerk, to mainstream attention with this stylish and inventive episodic thriller about corruption and temptation. It featured guns, femmes fatales, deadly hit-men", "Tarantino has fashioned the film as an ironic commentary on the themes of contingency and redemption - bedrocks of more conventionally prototypical Hollywood fare.", "As much pop as pulp, this is exhilarating stuff and clearly one of the best films of the 1990s.", "This movie boasts groundbreaking direction, cinematography, screenwriting, soundtrack, and extraordinary performances (particularly by Thurman, Travolta, and Jackson).", "Even at its most mindless this is essential stuff.", "There's not much to add about Tarantino's magnum opus, so popular over the years and buoyed by dialogue so sharp and witty it'll be quoted with glee by the grandchildren of millennials.", "Pulp Fiction is condemned to be a hit. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Pacey, punchy and at times hilarious. It's quite a movie.", "What is unusual is that a director with such visual flair should be so interested in words. Tarantino offers actors the kind of dialogue -- and monologue -- usually found only in theatre.", "Reservoir Dogs still looks like the great American film of the decade, but Quentin Tarantino's second film as writer-director shows him already deep in the territory of self-parody.", "I was looking forward to this like you wouldn't believe... but it all goes on for so long and it's not terribly witty.", "I can't think of another filmmaker in America who disturbs me this way. But I know full well that that's his point. It's because he's on to something. He has put some things together that I don't think should be put together.", "Soon enough you come down off its high, with that druggie feeling of your bones being hollow and your skin encrusted with dirt; but you can't deny that the movie delivers... or that it somehow elevates craft and cleverness to the level of art.", "These days a genuine movie surprise is so rare that it feels like a gift."], "rating": ["5/5", "1", "", "C-", "", "", "A+", "4/5", "5/5", "5/5", "4/4", "", "", "5/5", "", "", "3/5", "4.5/5", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tony Black", "Mike Massie", "Allen Almachar", "Murtada Elfadl", "Adam Nayman", "Ed Travis", "Tim Dirks", "PJ Nabarro", "David Parkinson", "Marjorie Kase", "Josh Larsen", "Tom Meek", "Casimiro Torreiro", "David Stratton", "Brian D.
