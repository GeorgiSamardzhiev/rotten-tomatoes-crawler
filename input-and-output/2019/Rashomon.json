{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Brimming with action while incisively examining the nature of truth, \"Rashomon\" is perhaps the finest film ever to investigate the philosophy of justice. Through an ingenious use of camera and flashbacks, Kurosawa reveals the complexities of human nature as four people recount different versions of the story of a man's murder and the rape of his wife.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Art House & International/Classics/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Akira Kurosawa", "studio": "DaieiMotionPictureCompany", "theater_date": "Dec 26, 1950", "dvd_date": "Mar 23, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Kurosawa's film changed criticism for the better. [Full Review in Spanish]", "A brilliant, puzzling, shocking export from Japan.", "[Kurosawa] has made it an intriguing picture, occasionally an exciting one. He accents a lot of his dramatic effect, it might be noted, with the throbbing of an increasing taut, Ravel-like bolero.", "...overtly devoid of entertaining, engrossing elements and generally comes off as a fairly interminable cinematic experience.", "A film that demonstrates that how you tell your story is just as important as what that story entails.", "A top-to-bottom miracle of a film, burly in its philosophy and graceful in its style.", "Akira Kurosawa's famous cosmic shrug", "With fast tracking shots, b&w chiaroscuro camerawork and a pessimistic intimation that what exactly was done is not essential, the result hit the bull's-eye with foreign filmgoers and critics.", "Masterpiece about absolute truth. Best for teens.", "\"Rashomon\" may be a prosecutor's nightmare, but it's a film lover's dream.", "The mixture of bravura camera work, muscular direction and inventive storytelling remains unmissable.", "Unmissable.", "What Akira Kurosawa and his tiny production team wrought is now an accepted maxim of modern life, a creed by which to live in a world where everyone has a blog and an opinion.", "The film, a 1950 landmark exploration of the confoundingly elusive nature of truth, received an Academy Award at a time when the prize for foreign-language film did not exist.", "Not many movies make such an impact that their names enter into the language. Rashomon is such a movie", "Akira Kurosawa's four-way account of a man's murder has become so associated with its central device %u2014 not to mention its myriad offshoots %u2014 that it requires an effort to see it only for itself.", "Film buffs should love it. But so should anyone who appreciates a good yarn or two (or three or four).", "a game-shifter that challenges all we think we know about truth", "Rashomon is a novel, stimulating moviegoing experience, and a sure sign that U.S. film importers will be looking hard at Japanese pictures from now on.", "This caused a flurry in critical circles for its brilliance of conception, technique, acting and its theme of passion."], "rating": ["4/5", "", "", "2/4", "5/5", "5/5", "", "", "5/5", "4/4", "5/5", "5/5", "3.5/4", "A", "", "A-", "4/4", "8", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Antonio R.
