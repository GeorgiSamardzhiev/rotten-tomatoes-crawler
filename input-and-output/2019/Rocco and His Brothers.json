{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Rosaria Parondi (Katina Paxinou), an impoverished Italian mother, moves to Milan with her close-knit family of five sons to find opportunity in the big city. A heated rivalry begins when two of Rosaria's boys -- Rocco (Alain Delon) and Simone (Renato Salvatori) -- fall for Nadia (Annie Girardot), a beautiful prostitute with whom each has an affair. As soft-spoken Rocco and brutal Simone both pursue Nadia in their own way, tension between them threatens to tear the family apart.", "rating": "89", "genre": "Art House & International/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h 35m", "director": "Luchino Visconti", "studio": "LesFilmsMarceau,Titanus", "theater_date": "Jun 26, 1961", "dvd_date": "Apr 16, 2012", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["[Rocco] is a work which shows Visconti addicted both to romantic melodrama and to contemporary social drama. It is through his own prodigious conviction and authority that these elements can be reconciled without arousing a fatal mistrust.", "Even at nearly three hours long,  Rocco and His Brothers  is a fleet-footed, intensely realized work", "The Idiot has much the same plot line, including the murder, but one believes it because Myshkin is made credible. But Visconti is no Dostoevski. When Rocco tries to go beyond naturalism, it becomes not tragedy but grand opera.", "... an epic of postwar Italy and a melodrama of seismic proportions boasting great photography and performances...", "Here, Visconti has every sort of strong contrast -Italy's two nations, the north and the south, industry and the land, simplicity and sophistication.", "\"Rocco and His Brothers\" is a film both authentic and ambitious, a classic that is as adept at telling individual stories as it is in drawing larger parallels from them.", "Visconti's methods are still partly neorealist, but the scale of the film is huge and operatic, and it loses the intimacy of the best neorealist films, and their breath of life.", "Today, distanced from ridiculous controversy and dislocated from the provincial politics that drive its story, this immaculately restored classic of post-WWII Italian cinema often feels like a new experience altogether.", "The Parondis' lives are difficult but gorgeous; boxing is terrible but riveting; the city offers everything even as it takes everything away.", "It's vital about violence being bred from systemic blind spots, where miniscule souls are tasked with the impossible.", "What you end up with is more an entertaining, overheated mish-mash than a great classic.", "One of Visconti's and Italian cinema's masterpieces", "Powerful neorealist melodrama.", "", "", "", "Apesar de ser mais longo do que deveria e de se entregar ao melodrama ocasional, o filme praticamente se transforma em um \u00e9pico familiar e conta com performances en\u00e9rgicas e inesquec\u00edveis (especialmente de Salvatori e Girardot).", "There is in this strong and surging drama of an Italian peasant family's shattering fate in the face of the brutalizing forces of unfamiliar modern city life a kind of emotional fullness and revelation that one finds in the great tragedies of the Greeks.", "Visconti returns to Milan, the city of his birth, in this story about the politics of class involved in the move to the big city of a family of impoverished southerners.", "Visconti's greatest achievement is how he mixes realism and melodrama."], "rating": ["", "3.5/4", "", "1", "", "", "", "5/5", "", "4/4", "4/5", "A", "B", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "5/5", "", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Derek Prouse", "Matthew Lucas", "Dwight MacDonald", "Michael Barrett", "Isabel Quigly", "Kenneth Turan", "Pauline Kael", "David Ehrlich", "Alan Scherstuhl", "Clayton Dillard", "Ken Hanke", "Emanuel Levy", "Dennis Schwartz", "Cole Smithey", "Thomas Delapa", "Carol Cling", "Pablo Villa\u00e7a", "Bosley Crowther", "Nick Barbaro", "Jeffrey M.
