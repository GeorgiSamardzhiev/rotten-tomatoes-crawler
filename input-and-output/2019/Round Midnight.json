{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the 1950s, Dale Turner (Dexter Gordon), a gifted black saxophonist with a drinking problem, leaves behind New York and his estranged family and relocates to Paris. There he plays for a progressive, jazz-loving audience without being judged by his race, and ages quietly in peace. Not intending to turn away from his vices, Dale nonetheless becomes the project of a French fan (Fran\u00e7ois Cluzet) who tries to help him fight his alcoholism, ultimately inspiring both Dale and his music.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "2h 10m", "director": "Bertrand Tavernier", "studio": "LittleBear[fr]", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 30, 2001", "box_office": "$2.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Watching Dale and Francis grow close is a subdued experience that evolves in quiet ways.", "Wonderful offbeat homage to be-bop.", "Dexter Gordon received a Best Actor nomination and Herbie Hancock the Original Score Music Oscar for this moody jazz piece anout an alcoholic musician down on his luck.", "He's not just writing about a dying old man, he's writing about jazz.", "Tavernier's striking widescreen frame established the rainy, neon-and-smoke filled world of the jazz film.", "Round Midnight is a superbly crafted music world drama in which Gallic director Bertrand Tavernier pays a moving dramatic tribute to the great black musicians who lived and performed in Paris in the late 1950s.", "One of the best jazz films ever made, this succeeds by melding French sensibilities about atmosphere with American sensibilities about the music.", "The director's perenially heavy mood seems especially well suited to this indigo-shaded story of a black American saxman (Dexter Gordon) living and performing in Paris in the late 50s.", "", "Dale Turner, as played by Dexter Gordon, seems to be an amalgam of Bud Powell and Lester Young, but the private, rueful dignity that he brings to bear is all his own.", "It's a brooding yet warm elegy, as plaintive as a slow, low-toned ballad in a minor key.", "", "", "The film's quality lies not just in its vivid portrayal of the bebop milieu, but also in its sensitive examination of the turbulent forces within an artist compelled to create on a nightly basis, despite personal consequences.", "", "No actor could do what the great jazz saxophonist Dexter Gordon does in 'Round Midnight.", "Guided by the spirit of the art form it celebrates, Tavernier's film is a mesmerizing audio-visual lament for the impending death of jazz", "You do not need to know a lot about jazz to appreciate what is going on because, in a certain sense, this movie teaches you everything about jazz that you really need to know.", "A lovingly gentle yet vibrant tribute to jazz, friendship and film itself, made by a director of consummate taste and precise imagination.", "Gordon goes the limit as Turner, dedicating his performance to all the cats who've gone before."], "rating": ["", "B+", "B+", "4/5", "", "", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "4/5", "5/5", "4/4", "4/5", "5/5", "", "4/4", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mark Chalon Smith", "Dennis Schwartz", "Emanuel Levy", "Christopher Null", "Jeffrey M.
