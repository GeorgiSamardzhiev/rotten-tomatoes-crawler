{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Free-spirited Lulu (Melanie Griffith) sets her sights on uptight banker Charles (Jeff Daniels) for a little bit of fun. Their relationship starts off simple enough with a tryst and some modest adventure, but Lulu wants Charles to pose as her husband at a high school reunion. It seems harmless enough to Charles, but that all changes when Lulu's actual husband, Ray (Ray Liotta), confronts them at the event. Understandably, Ray isn't content to let Charles and Lulu ride off into the sunset.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "Jonathan Demme", "studio": "ReligiosaPrimitiva", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 30, 2016", "box_office": "$6.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It's not every day that someone goes Alfred Hitchcock one better, but in ''Something Wild,'' Jonathan Demme has done it.", "As an artefact from a period -- the mid-80s -- that produced almost nothing distinctive, this remains breezy fun.", "Something Wild is fun, at first. Then it becomes deadly and weird and engrossing. Predictable it is not.", "Buy a ticket to this whirligig of a movie at your own risk. You enter a fun house and exit through a chamber of horrors. But director Jonathan Demme provides a heck of a ride.", "This is the Demme of \"Melvin and Howard,\" soaring back where he belongs, and long overdue too.", "Something Wild is an excellent movie about the fragility of people's images. [Full Review in Spanish]", "It's a rather routine storyline that's perpetually employed to striking, enthralling effect by Demme...", "The end's not unexpected, and the soundtrack's overloaded with songs, but once Something Wild gets really wild -- with Daniels and Griffith and Demme's fringe comedy at their best -- the movie makes its mark as offbeat entertainment.", "Part screwball comedy and part thriller, the unpredictable turns of Something Wild indeed chart its characters' untamed, untapped inner resources.", "Something Wild is undoubtedly a minor work in the oeuvre of all its major players, yet it is never less than charming, and at times is almost inspired.", "Captures the tension of trying to stand out in cookie-cutter world without alienating everyone around you.", "Radiantly human even as, and after, it erupts in violence and rage, \"Something Wild\" remains an astonishing rarity - a bittersweet romantic tragicomedy that's generally optimistic ... but also hesitant and harmful exactly where it needs to be.", "The tones shift rampantly, which for some viewers can be disorienting and off-putting. But, if you're in tune with Demme's aesthetic, which usually runs counter to our cinematic intuition, it is a wild ride indeed.", "It begins with a meet-cute and ends with a murder, and sandwiched in between those emotional extremes are romance, regret and revenge.", "If you don't already know where it ends up then I assure you that you have no idea where it's going to end up.", "A fun, offbeat, and mildly subversive comedy ... with unexpected twists and ... a real sense of danger.", "Conceptually and stylistically compelling under Jonathan Demme's sometimes striking direction, this offbeat thriller is about an unlikely couple on the run.", "The third film in Demme's Small-Town America trilogy (the other two are Handle With Care and Melvin and Howard) centers on a new screen type, the yuppie (played to perfection by Jeff Daniels); change of tone from comedy to horror is tough but well-earned", "Demme keeps his quirky narrative twisting and turning so that the viewer can never predict what will happen next.", "Jonathan Demme's picaresque joyride across the American landscape is still arguably the best thing he's ever done."], "rating": ["4/4", "4/5", "3/4", "", "", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "3/5", "3.5/4", "4.5/5", "3.5/4", "", "8/10", "3.5/4", "", "A-", "3.5/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Dave Kehr", "William Thomas", "Roger Hurlburt", "People Staff", "Sheila Benson", "Octavi Marti", "David Nusair", "Judith Crist", "Pat Padua", "Christopher Machell", "Josh Larsen", "Nick Rogers", "James Kendrick", "William Goss", "Christopher Long", "Eric Melin", "Variety Staff", "Emanuel Levy", "", "Pat Graham"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WWOR-TV (NJ)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Yap", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Q Network Film Desk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Metropolis", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Scene-Stealers.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader"], "date": ["June 11, 2020", "June 11, 2020", "June 11, 2020", "June 11, 2020", "June 11, 2020", "April 21, 2020", "April 21, 2020", "February 26, 2020", "August 28, 2018", "March 5, 2018", "May 10, 2017", "July 26, 2016", "May 20, 2011", "May 17, 2011", "May 16, 2011", "May 13, 2011", "July 6, 2010", "February 8, 2007", "December 26, 2006", "December 26, 2006"]}}
