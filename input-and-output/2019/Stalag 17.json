{"metadata": {"synopsis": "One night in 1944 in a German POW camp housing American airmen, two prisoners try to escape the compound and are quickly discovered and shot dead. Among the remaining men, suspicion grows that one of their own is a spy for the Germans. All eyes fall on Sgt. Sefton (William Holden) who everybody knows frequently makes exchanges with German guards for small luxuries. To protect himself from a mob of his enraged fellow inmates, Sgt. Sefton resolves to find the true traitor within their midst.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Classics/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "2h", "director": "Billy Wilder", "studio": "ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 12, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Stalag 17 is a crude, clich\u00e9-ridden glimpse of a Nazi prison camp that I hated to see end.", "Stalag 17 is too much of a comedy for a WWII-set film but sometimes, you just have to turn to humor in order to survive.", "A raucous, cynical but compelling comedy-drama about the life led by American soldiers in a German prison camp in 1944. Not recommended for the kiddies.", "Simultaneously fiery and farcical, it's a fitting final third for Wilder's 1950s hat trick that also includes Sunset Blvd and Ace in the Hole", "Director Billy Wilder superbly balances elements of drama, satire and comedy, and captures the claustrophobia of camp life.", "William Holden won his first and only Best Actor Oscar for Billy Wilder's vastly entertaining serio comedy set in a POW camp.", "When escape is the only option, you do whatever you can to make it happen. This is one exciting escape drama.", "Teens may enjoy this exceptional, exciting drama.", "As rowdily entertaining on the screen as it was on the stage.", "Interesting depiction with a pretty decent performance from Holden and supported by a credible cast.", "A bleak, black comedy in which the laughter can die in the throat.", "The resulting letdown is terrific, but along the way there is some of the funniest men-at-loose-ends interplay that Wilder has ever put on film.", "One could make an argument that, among 20th century directors, few were more versatile than Billy Wilder.", "A lusty comedy-melodrama, loaded with bold, masculine humor and as much of the original's uninhibited earthiness as good taste and the Production Code permit.", "Unforgettable Billy Wilder POW tale with Holden in perhaps his greatest role.", "The prison story had an offbeat flavor that was pleasing.", "As with many of Wilder's films, you tend to forget just how funny it is %u2014 the way the master director cuts tension with incisive wit and barely controlled silliness.", "The good greatly outweighs the bad, particularly in the profile of Holden's character, a pragmatic, self-centered cynic whose heroism, when it is finally called upon, appears to come from deep within the barriers he has placed inside of himself.", "Billy Wilder's film strikes several different notes: it's comic, dramatic, suspenseful and touching in turn.", "In the end, Stalag 17's irreverence likely didn't revolutionize moviemaking for adults so much as it paved the way for the likes of M*A*S*H and Animal House.
