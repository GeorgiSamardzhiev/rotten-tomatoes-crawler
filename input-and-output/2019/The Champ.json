{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Champ (Wallace Beery) is a down-on-his-luck boxer in Tijuana whose son, Dink (Jackie Cooper), adores him despite Champ's addictions to alcohol and gambling. When Champ wins enough money from a bet to buy Dink a horse, they enter it into a race, where they encounter Linda (Irene Rich), Dink's mother, whom he has never met. Linda's rich new husband, Tony (Hale Hamilton), convinces Champ to let Dink come and stay with them, but Dink's love for his father brings him back to Tijuana.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Kids & Family", "runtime": "1h 26m", "director": "King Vidor", "studio": "Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 4, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Wallace Beery, one of the finest actors In Hollywood, plays the co-starring role with Jackie.
