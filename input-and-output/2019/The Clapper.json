What we end up with is something that never really does both well and ends up hampering each theme.", "The Clapper is not a film for everyone. It is a small film that has some charm as a sweet oddball rom com but which falls short in exploring its characters.", "There's not much to applaud in this misguided offbeat comedy that fails to generate sufficient humor or poignancy from a broad satirical target.", "The thin premise lacks any compelling elements, is absent of any engaging characters, and eventually goes nowhere.", "An exercise in patience that rewards viewers with a tacked-on ending that simply reinforces the fact that this is a film filled with squandered talent and sloppy storytelling.", "I expect shade will be thrown because of the film's low ambition, and it truly is (intentionally?) sloppy and doesn't have great production values, but the benchmark for stories is whether they can touch an audience and The Clapper does.", "The concept here had potential, but the execution makes it completely dead on arrival.", "Perhaps Montiel is after something bigger than what \"The Clapper\" ultimately offers, but it's not an ambitious picture, hitting easy targets with crude screenwriting and bland performances.", "Though it's not exactly brilliant, this indie romcom is passably charming, and it finds offbeat atmosphere in an uncharted corner of Hollywood: scuzzy places where the glamorous would fear to tread.", "If it's supposed to be a comedy, it's not funny. If it's supposed to be a satire, it doesn't know what it's satirizing.", "The movie is a less assured version of Shira Piven's Welcome to Me, in which she and Kristen Wiig unleash the full neurotic potential of the \"15 minutes of fame\" expression. The Clapper only pays lip service to it.", "Montiel treats his story's happily unsung oddballs with sincere affection. He doesn't hold them up to ridicule, or insist that they snap out of their quirkiness and conform. But he doesn't quite know what to do with them.", "It's an interesting premise, but The Clapper doesn't live up to its namesake.", "There's zero real humor in The Clapper-at least not the kind we've come to expect from its stars.", "The screenplay is uneven, but the exceptionally strong cast makes it watchable.", "It may be early in the year, but it's a good bet \"The Clapper\" will land among 2018's worst films.", "Even at a time of year when movie companies typically unload their dross, the sheer awfulness of Dito Montiel's \"The Clapper\" stands out.", "A small movie with a big, generous heart, it never makes fun of its characters, even the guy who trots around Hollywood in a diaper, or the dude dressed up like a big baked potato.", "The Clapper hints at the psychological roots of Eddie's peculiar personality, but in the end it isn't at all interested in understanding the man. And that's because it's too busy making fun of him.", "Mostly it's a quiet salute to classic romantic comedy - and to a star who, frankly, is far nicer than the times he was born to work in."], "rating": ["3/5", "3/5", "", "1/5", "3/10", "6/10", "1.5/4", "D", "3/5", "1/4", "", "", "", "", "B-", "", "", "3/5", "1/4", "2.5/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Julian Lytle", "Cate Marquis", "Todd Jorgenson", "Louisa Moore", "Adam Patterson", "Bradley Gibson", "Joey Magidson", "Brian Orndorf", "Jeffrey M.
