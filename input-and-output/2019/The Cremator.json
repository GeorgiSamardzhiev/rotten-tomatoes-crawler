{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In Prague, Kopfrkingl (Rudolf Hrus\u00ednsk\u00fd) enjoys his work at the crematorium perhaps a bit too much, having gained a perverse idea of reincarnation from his haphazard studies of Tibet. After World War II breaks out, there is a sudden need to be as Aryan as possible, and Kopfrkingl's old friend Reinke (Ilja Prachar) points out that Kopfrkingl has some German heritage. But his wife is Jewish, which makes his children Jewish, which makes the now-Nazi Kopfrkingl's blood boil.", "rating": "88", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Horror", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Juraj Herz", "studio": "NewWorld", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 9, 2020", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["While retrospect allows one to appreciate The Cremator's comically monstrous undertones, it's dismaying sense of dread has only become more potent over time.", "A valuable moral, but it is hard to care about the destiny of characters who are depicted as freaks from the beginning.
