It is a gorgeous triumph -- one lion in which the studio can take justified pride.", "This crowd-pleasing cartoon musical from Walt Disney had enormous box-office appeal, and proved so popular that it was adapted as a spectacular stage show.", "Between traumas, the movie serves up soothingly banal musical numbers (composed by Elton John and Tim Rice) and silly, rambunctious comedy.", "It's perhaps the closest Disney has come to creating a consciously mythical entertainment in the style of Star Wars. Yet like that film it keeps its sense of humor and fun.", "Even with its flaws, this latest Disney animated feature once again delivers what its audience wants.
