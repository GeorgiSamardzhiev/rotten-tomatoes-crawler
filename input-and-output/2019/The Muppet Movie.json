If you can figure out how they were able to show Kermit pedaling across the screen, then you are less a romantic than I am: I prefer to believe he did it himself.", "With charm for the kids and in-jokes for their parents (when Kermit's bicycle gets mangled, he quips, \"I thought I was gone with the Schwinn\"), Muppet creator Jim Henson tries to give everybody a little something.", "The cast are all here, along with the technical wizardry, but the dialogue staggers from one leaden gag to another and there is an unmistakeable note of desperation throughout.", "As expected, Fozzie the Bear and the old geezers Statler and Waldorf receive the lion's share of the choice lines.", "while The Muppet Movie is certainly entertaining, the shift to a coherent, linear, feature-length narrative deprives the film the show's brilliantly structured inanity", "With his Muppets, Henson found a balance between fuzzy post-hippie positivism and self-deprecating wit, and he added in the same quality that made many of the era's cultural phenomena so charming: simple problem-solving.", "'The Muppet Movie' is one big road trip, and like 'The Blues Brothers' there's a payoff not just at the end, but around nearly every corner.
