[Full review in Spanish]", "If anything, it veers into the \"so bad it's good\" territory of cinema's terrain. It also offers also plenty of opportunities to examine Chinese projections of armageddon and bureaucracy... However, none of these elements make it a good film.", "It's almost impressive how Gwo manages to rip off \"Gravity,\" \"Sunshine,\" and \"2001,\" all at the same time.", "It's exactly the mix of cheesy and crowd-pleasing that you'd expect from a blockbuster, with eye-popping CGI sci-fi set dressing to give it a little extra oomph.", "Critics well-versed in the relationship between state and cinema will undoubtedly have a lot to say about those themes, but this should not detract from the fact that, as a piece of broad entertainment, there is plenty to enjoy.", "Loud, frenetic, and filled with sublime industrial and cosmic moments, blasts for fire and rockets, falling boulders and chunks of ice and blocks of concrete.", "Escapist in the broadest and most accessible sense of the word, champion of a humanism for all audiences and without complications.
