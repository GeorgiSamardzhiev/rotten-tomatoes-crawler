{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In the wake of her mother's death in a mental institution, detective Rita Veder (Angela Bassett) is assigned to a baffling serial murder case. After examining the crime scene -- a corpse-filled ship found adrift at sea -- Rita meets Maximilian (Eddie Murphy), a smooth-talking Caribbean playboy determined to romance her. When Rita begins suffering from crippling hallucinations, she calls upon Dr. Zeko (Zakes Mokae), an occultist who suspects a vampire is on the loose.", "rating": "12", "genre": "Comedy/Horror", "runtime": "1h 41m", "director": "Wes Craven", "studio": "ParamountPictures,EddieMurphyProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 2, 2013", "box_office": "$18.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["If your idea of a laff riot is a guy's ear falling off, then this movie might be for you.
