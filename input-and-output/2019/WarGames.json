{"metadata": {"synopsis": "High school student David Lightman (Matthew Broderick) unwittingly hacks into a military supercomputer while searching for new video games. After starting a game of Global Thermonuclear War, Lightman leads the supercomputer to activate the nation's nuclear arsenal in response to his simulated threat as the Soviet Union. Once the clueless hacker comes to his senses, Lightman, with help from his girlfriend (Ally Sheedy), must find a way to alert the authorities to stop the onset of World War III.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 53m", "director": "John Badham", "studio": "MetroGoldwynMayer", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 29, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["WarGames kicks off with an exciting sequence...", "Like a man drawn to the edge of a cliff by the lure of the abyss below, we're secretly obsessed by the apocalypse. Moralists may claim that WarGames is more exploitation than warning, but it's still an exciting, giddily entertaining movie.", "The movie is a spectacle as well as a presumably pacifist proclamation. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The chase sequences with government agents are tame but the film builds to a tense (and witty) conclusion at the Cheyenne Mountain nuclear bunker in Colorado Springs.", "What keeps it remarkably fresh is an unpatronising approach to what is ostensibly a kids' thriller, and a set of ideas (remember when Hollywood used them?) that rightly consign all the cradle modems and dot-matrix printers to the margins.", "Slick and suspenseful, though a little heavy-handed.", "This inventive nail-biter is very much a product of its time -- blending the arms-race unease of the early 1980s with the beginning of the home-computer revolution -- but it still manages to both grip and entertain.", "Time might not have been kind to the look of WarGames, but with nuclear war still a very real threat, the picture's ability to manufacture suspense remains undimmed.", "It's far too simplistic for comfort -- and downright dangerous if it makes anyone think today's self-destructive forces will bow jovially out of sight as soon as we grown-ups loosen up a little.", "Classic humanist-didactic filmmaking, effectively presented as a thriller.", "Memory makes the heart grow fonder, even when you're blowing up the world.", "As a Cold War message movie and cinematic descendent of Fail-Safe, WarGames examines the inherent danger in favoring technology's cool logic and situational calculations.", "In many ways, John Badham's intriguing tale was prophetic.", "Suspenseful Cold War tale with teen gamer in control.", "Although today it feels rather dated, especially with its technology, it is one of the better examples of the genre.", "In this sage satire, warfare is boiled down to the inanities of tic-tac-toe", "To me, the most enjoyable aspect of WarGames is when David is at work on his computer system. There's something wonderfully nostalgic about watching a guy play with such antiquated machinery and recognize that it was [once] considered state-of-the-art.", "John Badham solders the pieces into a terrifically exciting story charged by an irresistible idea: an extra-smart kid can get the world into a whole lot of trouble that it also takes the same extra-smart kid to rescue it from.", "What works best about it works still: it's a paranoid film with an ambiguous ending.", "As tense and effective now as it was 25 years ago.
