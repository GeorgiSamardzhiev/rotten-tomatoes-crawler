{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Disillusioned with romance, Beth, an ambitious New Yorker (Kristen Bell), travels to Rome, where she plucks magic coins from a special fountain. The coins attract an assortment of odd suitors, including a sausage merchant, a street magician and an artist. But when a persistent reporter (Josh Duhamel) throws his hat in the ring, Beth wonders if his love is the real thing.", "rating": "17", "genre": "Comedy/Drama/Romance", "runtime": "1h 31m", "director": "Mark Steven Johnson", "studio": "GaryFoster", "theater_date": "Jan 29, 2010", "dvd_date": "Aug 10, 2016", "box_office": "$32.7M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The dialogue is terribly forced, the acting is exaggerated, and the characters are excessively fake.", "Cute and charming enough to pass for a matinee date.", "WHEN IN ROME. A gift from the comic gods themselves.", "Fun and girly are key adjectives in this movie.", "My kind of romantic comedy. It's funny, a bit silly and doesn't try to set the new standard for romance in the genre. It's exactly what you expect, but in a good way.", "", "", "Most of the troubles come from the painfully unfunny shenanigans of Beth's magic-stricken admirers.", "When in Rome never delves deep into anything, but whisks us through the conventions of romantic comedies so quickly there's barely time to groan.", "", "", "When in Rome is an insipid waste; every ounce of potential has been steadfastly turned away from in order to make a safe little piece of clowning.", "[Bell] carries a classic presence and charm that is tough not to like. Yet, at the same time, she does so with a little spunk and sass.", "...we are expected to suspend our disbelief and accept that the adorable Kristen Bell needs some sort of crackpot magic spell to attract suitors.", "You know from the start of Mark Steven Johnson's silly, sunny romcom how it's going to end.", "Number of record-scratch jokes? Three. Number of walk-into-a-lamppost gags? Two. Number of laughs? Take a wild guess.", "Despite its over-the-top zaniness, this romantic comedy manages to keep us entertained with its starry cast and a nutty plot. If only the filmmakers had resisted the urge to exaggerate both the humour and the sentimentality.", "This Italian-themed romcom is not quite the most unspeakably-patronising-to-Italy film of all time. That prize belongs to the musical Nine, starring Daniel Day-Lewis. But it runs a very close second.", "All you need to know about When In Rome is that it was written by David Diamond and David Weissman, who perpetrated the atrocity that was the Robin Williams-John Travolta 'comedy' Old Dogs.", "Ladies, here's a chick-flick best enjoyed with your eyelids actually glued together."], "rating": ["3/10", "2.5/4", "", "2/5", "6/10", "B-", "1/5", "C-", "", "D", "0.5/5", "4.5/10", "", "7", "2/5", "1/5", "2/5", "1/5", "3/5", "1/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Brigit Grant", "Jeffrey Lyles", "Nell Minow", "Joshua Rothkopf", "Greg Maki", "Sarah Sluis", "Laremy Legel", "Dave White", "Joshua Starnes", "Ryan Cracknell", "Philip Martin", "Marc Lee", "Robbie Collin", "Rich Cline", "Peter Bradshaw", "Christopher Tookey", "David Edwards"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Express (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lyles&#39; Movie Files", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Mom", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Star-Democrat (Easton, MD)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Journal International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movies.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">ComingSoon.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Views", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">News of the World", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Shadows on the Wall", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Mail (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Mirror (UK)"], "date": ["November 30, 2020", "September 27, 2020", "November 6, 2019", "August 23, 2017", "February 7, 2013", "February 18, 2012", "November 17, 2011", "November 5, 2011", "August 15, 2011", "May 6, 2011", "April 4, 2011", "March 10, 2011", "December 23, 2010", "July 3, 2010", "June 30, 2010", "June 30, 2010", "June 30, 2010", "June 25, 2010", "June 25, 2010", "June 25, 2010"]}}
