{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Crotchety retired doctor Isak Borg (Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m) travels from Stockholm to Lund, Sweden, with his pregnant and unhappy daughter-in-law, Marianne (Ingrid Thulin), in order to receive an honorary degree from his alma mater. Along the way, they encounter a series of hitchhikers, each of whom causes the elderly doctor to muse upon the pleasures and failures of his own life. These include the vivacious young Sara (Bibi Andersson), a dead ringer for the doctor's own first love.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 30m", "director": "Ingmar Bergman", "studio": "SvenskFilmindustri", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 14, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A celebration of the power of actors to create rich personalities for us to spend time with.", "Wild Strawberries is to my mind a far more complete and interesting film than the much over- praised Seventh Seal, for the simple reason that it says something negative.", "Bergman understands one of the most bittersweet characteristics of nostalgia: it juxtaposes our memories, in which everyone is young and healthy, and the inevitable reality of physical decline that followed. [Full review in Portuguese.]", "Bergman's dual journey of remembrances and reveries", "[VIDEO ESSAY] \"Wild Strawberries\" is a thematically abundant film that fluidly condenses a lifetime's worth of experience into succinct cinematic fragments under Ingmar Bergman's complex construction of abstract corollaries.", "...an intensely cinematic psychological portrait of a man reckoning with the how and why of who he's become.", "Gunnar Fischer's photography becomes ever more luminous and Sjstrm's performance grows in greatness.", "The relentless symbolism, and some rather heavy-handed dream sequences are off-putting at times, but Wild Strawberries has enough sorrow, warmth and profundity to make for sophisticated and rewarding viewing.", "If some of the symbolism is a bit top-heavy, Bergman's richly evocative contrasts of youth with age more than compensate, as does Sjstrm's majestic performance.", "A reviewer must exercise some tact in discussing this picture. It is a work of such high and subtle art that the temptation is to run in with a smother of adjectives and a display of analytical explanation.", "Bergman's often heralded masterpiece of European cinema is more than a formal delight. It's funny, touching, and very, very emotional.", "Swedish master Ingmar Bergman delivered one of his greatest ruminations on love and life in this 1957 drama.", "Several actors who were to form the director's virtual stock company are here, but it is Sjstrm who is heart and soul of the film.", "It's a personal and profound work.", "With unyielding moral precision no less austere for the lack of any religious conviction behind it, Bergman subjects his protagonist to judgment for the crimes of indifference and selfishness, and pronounces a verdict of \"the usual\" sentence: loneliness.", "An archetypal Ingmar Bergman film, and one of his best.", "One of Ingmar Bergman's many masterpieces, this universal meditation on the meaning of life is extremely well-acted by Victor Sjostrom (also known as director) as ther aging professor.", "It's most memorable due to the heartfelt sterling performance by the seventy-something Victor Seastrom.", "One of Bergman's warmest, and therefore finest films.", ""], "rating": ["5/5", "", "5/5", "", "A+", "4/4", "4/5", "", "4/5", "", "4/4", "4/4", "", "", "A", "", "A", "A", "", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Tim Brayton", "Isabel Quigly", "Pablo Villa\u00e7a", "Fernando F.
