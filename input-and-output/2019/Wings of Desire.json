{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Two angels, Damiel (Bruno Ganz) and Cassiel (Otto Sander), glide through the streets of Berlin, observing the bustling population, providing invisible rays of hope to the distressed but never interacting with them. When Damiel falls in love with lonely trapeze artist Marion (Solveig Dommartin), the angel longs to experience life in the physical world, and finds--with some words of wisdom from actor Peter Falk (playing himself) -- that it might be possible for him to take human form.", "rating": "98", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Romance", "runtime": "2h 8m", "director": "Wim Wenders", "studio": "ArgosFilms", "theater_date": "Jan 1, 1987", "dvd_date": "Mar 23, 2017", "box_office": "$120.8K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Brobably the closest thing to a popular movie about metaphysics that the medium has had yet to offer.", "Peter Handke's script plays a big role when it injects into the movie a suitable poetic breath. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Wenders has made a film that is elegiac but harsh, hard-edged and romantic, haunted as well as haunting, but that... holds out the promise of love as a benign coming-to-rest.", "It is a complex work of art that can only grow in stature from repeated viewings.", "The film's pacing and ethereal camera movements only help to magnify the angelic tranquility...Wenders is challenging us to rethink how we view our place in the world.", "Some of the finest of writer Peter Handke's work, influenced by Rainer Maria Rilke, is on generous offer. Henri Alekan's camerawork, poetry upon poetry, is particularly fine.", "It remains one of the most beautiful, heartfelt movies ever, and will always be just what I need.", "Whether or not Wings of Desire qualifies as the most poetic feature to grace the silver screen, it certainly earns that honour where Berlin is concerned.", "I love that search for what makes a human.", "A stunningly made valentine to the city of Berlin, which has never been more imaginatively or more beautifully filmed. A joy from start to finish.", "Wings of Desire has an ingenuousness, a sweetness of spirit, that triumphs over the conventional rigidities of its calculation.", "This story of angels is really an examination of what it means to be human -- in the most profound sense but via the smallest, most trivial details.", "A beautiful, literate and romantic piece of cinema.", "A fantasy that... goes right in spite of its solemn style.", "A sublimely beautiful, deeply romantic film for our times.", "How brilliant is Wings of Desire? Understand that Peter Falk is playing himself - that is to say, he's playing actor Peter Falk, who happened to be an angel himself until he elected to become human decades earlier.", "Demands to be seen by cinema lovers.", "The cinematography by Henri Alekan is simply astonishing in its spare yet lyrical quality.", "How much Eurobabble are you willing to endure in exchange for a look at one of the cinema's most ravishing and compassionate screen visions?", "a film of sheer visual poetry and deep emotional resonance"], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "A", "1", "", "", "5/5", "5/5", "", "9.3/10", "5/5", "", "", "4/4", "A", "4/5", "4/4", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Dennis Harvey", "Octavi Marti", "Molly Haskell", "David Harris", "Courtney Small", "Ray Pride", "Sherilyn Connelly", "Sarah Ward", "Margaret Pomeranz", "David Stratton", "Jonathan Baumbach", "Tim Regan-Porter", "Ian Nathan", "Joe Morgenstern", "David Stratton", "Matt Brunson", "Dennis Schwartz", "Christopher Lloyd", "Josh Larsen", "James Kendrick"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">48 Hills", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">El Pais (Spain)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Vogue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Spectrum Culture", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Axis", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newcity", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">SF Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Goethe-Institute Australien Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">At the Movies (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">At the Movies (Australia)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Nation", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Paste Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Wall Street Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sarasota Herald-Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">LarsenOnFilm", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Q Network Film Desk"], "date": ["October 22, 2020", "April 22, 2020", "February 27, 2020", "October 16, 2019", "February 16, 2019", "December 24, 2018", "October 25, 2018", "June 13, 2018", "November 2, 2017", "November 2, 2017", "November 27, 2012", "November 27, 2012", "November 27, 2012", "November 27, 2012", "November 27, 2012", "June 25, 2011", "March 23, 2011", "November 29, 2010", "January 26, 2010", "November 8, 2009"]}}
