The pitch is often too loud for film and, with the staging of some scenes, the goings-on occasionally feel more suitable for the theatre than for the big screen.", "Despite his guilt-inducing tactics, the only message that 102 Not Out ironically disseminates is the abject need for educating our birth-givers in the language of parental independence.", "102 Not Out is uneven but heartfelt. Despite the flaws, the emotions connect. And if like me, you are of a certain vintage, you will get a nostalgic head-rush when you see Rishi Kapoor and Amitabh Bachchan in the same frame.", "I suspect that this is the kind of average fare that relies on who its viewers are. Many parents might choose to overlook the flimsiness and view this as a winning unbeaten century in a chase. I'm not so sure others may look at it the same way.", "This chintzy portion of screenwriter Saumya Joshi's consistently sentimental narrative is mostly bearable thanks to Kapoor's comic timing and Bachchan's seemingly boundless energy.", "The prospect of Amitabh Bachchan and Rishi Kapoor together on screen is an enticing one, but Shukla and writer Saumya Joshi don't give them enough to do, which is a pity.", "Based on a Gujarati play of the same name, Umesh Shukla's film is unable to leave its inherent theatricality behind. It gets unchanging in terms of the give and take between the duo and leaves the viewers static too.", "A dramedy that delivers a worn-out social message as it trundles along on the back of the antics of an odd father-son pair with divergent approaches to life, Umesh Shukla's 102 Not Out has moments that strike a chord.", "Amitabh Bachchan and Rishi Kapoor ensure that you root for them despite a few hiccups in the script.", "The movie, based on Saumya Joshi's popular Gujarati play of the same name, sticks so closely to its stage origins that it feels as though we are actually watching a filmed play.", "While it may not shake you to the core, the film has the power to put a smile on your face.", "The ease with which the film portrays the bittersweet relationship between its characters is fantastic. Such films are like soft serve ice cream on a sparkly Sunday afternoon.", "All writing is open to interpretation by the actors and when you take stalwarts like Amitabh Bachchan and Rishi Kapoor, you can be assured that they'll rise above the call of duty to elevate the film."], "rating": ["2.5/5", "", "3/5", "2/5", "2.5/4", "", "", "2/5", "3/5", "", "3/5", "", "3.5/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Udita Jhunjhunwala", "Poulomi Das", "Anupama Chopra", "Rahul Desai", "Simon Abrams", "Shilpa Jamkhandikar", "Namrata Joshi", "Saibal Chatterjee", "Rohit Vats", "Nandini Ramnath", "Manjusha Radhakrishnan", "Rachit Gupta", "Devesh Sharma"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Firstpost", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arr\u00e9", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Companion", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Companion", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">RogerEbert.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reuters", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Hindu", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">NDTV", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hindustan Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Scroll.in", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gulf News (UAE)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Times of India", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmfare"], "date": ["March 14, 2019", "March 11, 2019", "August 28, 2018", "August 27, 2018", "May 5, 2018", "May 4, 2018", "May 4, 2018", "May 4, 2018", "May 4, 2018", "May 4, 2018", "May 3, 2018", "May 2, 2018", "May 2, 2018"]}}
