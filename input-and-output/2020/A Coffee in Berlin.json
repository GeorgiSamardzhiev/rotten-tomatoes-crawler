He only maintains viewer sympathy because everyone else in the film is so obnoxious.", "It manages to make an entertaining story out of nothing in particular. And just when you get comfortable passively observing a passive observer, the minutest of twists becomes its own call to action.", "The film probes deep into the soul of Berlin, asking questions more befitting an old master than a rookie filmmaker.", "Lightly likable German indie-flavored romp.", "Its low-key, easy pace and refusal to put extra emphasis on anything gives the real emotions more power when they do arrive.", "Germany gets an updated look at the debris of its newest generation in terms of character, content, and concrete.", "Despite Schilling's dutiful effort to embody a man who's trying to slip out of view, A Coffee in Berlin runs out of inspiration, and even the Woody Allen adoration isn't enough to bring it back to life.", "As sure of itself visually in its black-and-white evocations of Berlin as its protagonist is unsure of himself and his future.", "In Gerster's view, Berlin's unresolved past taints its bustling charm and glossy serenity, as well as every familiar course of practical action-yet his movie veers toward the historical kitsch that he satirizes.", "The film's finale is so strong, it almost convinces you you've seen a better film than you actually have.", "A Coffee in Berlin is only a good film, but it does have a very good ending.", "Director Jan Ole Gerster lacks the confidence to set his main character genuinely adrift, instead caging him in scenes of cloying seriocomedy."], "rating": ["7/10", "", "", "", "B+", "", "B+", "3", "2/4", "3/4", "", "", "B+", "", "C", "3/4", "", "C+", "3/4", "C+"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Bernard Boo", "Stephen Saito", "Morgan Rojas", "Charles Mudede", "John Fink", "Martin Tsai", "Harvey S.
