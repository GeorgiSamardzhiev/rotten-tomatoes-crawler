{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In a film based on the writings of French Resistance fighter and POW Andr\u00e9 Devigny, Fontaine (Fran\u00e7ois Leterrier) is being held by the Nazis at Fort Montluc. When he gets word that he's scheduled for execution, Fontaine channels his energy into hatching a plan to break out. His plan is interrupted when he is assigned a new roommate. Fontaine grudgingly brings the newcomer in on the escape effort, which involves homespun weapons and an intricate knowledge of the layout of the prison itself.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Art House & International/Classics/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 42m", "director": "Robert Bresson", "studio": "Gaumont,NouvelleFranceProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 17, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A powerful French film focuses on the eternally fascinating theme of escape from prison. It's classic in outline, though set in the ugliest period of modern times.", "Since we never get aware of Fontaine's motivation; the only reason becomes to 'revolt against the system in place.' This makes A Man Escaped a transcendental prison drama that stands way beyond the comprehension of generic prison-escape films.", "Without a doubt one of the greatest films ever made, a film both thrilling and meditative, that should serve as a textbook for modern filmmakers on how to create and sustain suspense.", "Bresson's [film] is both the most realistic and the most poetic of jailbreak films.", "It's coolly comforting to recall how the innocence that lay shattered in the wake of World War II wasn't America's alone - just as it's heartening to rediscover the improbable beauty within the bleak scenario of A Man Escaped.", "Robert Bresson's story of an imprisoned and condemned French Resistance fighter who plans an escape with his teenage cellmate is one of the great classics of European art cinema.", "Not just the greatest prison escape film ever made, it is one of the greatest films of any kind ever made. And the coolest thing is, Bresson would get even better.", "Coming from a director renowned as spartanly anti-dramatic, the film's escape is almost preternaturally gripping.", "It is Bresson's unadorned, almost ascetic style that lifts the tale beyond a genre piece.", "A Man Escaped masterfully constructs the spaces -- physical and mental -- inhabited by Lt. Fontaine (played in a low-key register by an untrained actor, Franois Leterrier).", "One of Bresson's most sublime and understated films, in a career that consists of a series of meditational masterpieces that minutely and compassionately examine the human condition.", "Bresson's masterpiece is still a pinnacle in French cinema.", "The prisoner's lonely ardor is enhanced by Mozart's Mass in C Minor; the ending of the movie, as the music wells up, is pure elation.", "The best of all prison-escape movies, it reconstructs the very notion of freedom through offscreen sounds and defines salvation in terms of painstakingly patient and meticulous effort.", "Bresson outdoes nearly every escape film you've ever seen, using little more than the face of Francois Leterrier and elemental off-screen sound.", "Even the title dispenses with unnecessary frills: A man escaped. What more do you need to know?", "A Man Escaped seems to be one of the few Bresson films that both his fans and detractors can agree on.", "Watching a film like A Man Escaped\"is like a lesson in the cinema. It teaches by demonstration all the sorts of things that are not necessary in a movie. By implication, it suggests most of the things we're accustomed to are superfluous.", "If it's not as emotionally haunting as Au Hasard Balthazar or Mouchette, it remains a powerful, compelling portrait of discipline, and humanity.", "A Man Escaped offers newcomers to Bresson perhaps the most accessible point of entry into the work of this brilliant, challenging, God-haunted artist."], "rating": ["", "5/5", "4/4", "4/4", "", "5/5", "1", "", "A+", "", "", "5/5", "", "", "4/4", "5/5", "4/4", "4/4", "7", "A"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Janet Graves", "Shikhar Verma", "Matthew Lucas", "Michael Wilmington", "Jonathan Kiefer", "Adrian Turner", "Christopher Long", "Godfrey Cheshire", "Lawrence O&#39;Toole", "Doug Cummings", "Gwendolyn Audrey Foster", "David Parkinson", "David Denby", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Josh Larsen", "David Fear", "Jaime N.
