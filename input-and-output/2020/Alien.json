{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In deep space, the crew of the commercial starship Nostromo is awakened from their cryo-sleep capsules halfway through their journey home to investigate a distress call from an alien vessel. The terror begins when the crew encounters a nest of eggs inside the alien ship.

[Full Review in Spanish]", "A masterpiece of suspense, horror and fear. Sigourney Weaver becomes an icon and helps pave the way for badass women in films. [Full review in Spanish]", "A truly remarkable film that hasn't aged a day, thanks to the horrific and inspired Giger design work, miniatures-based special effects and the tone Ridley Scott created.", "There is something beautifully simplistic about Alien-the practical effects, the design of the alien, and how the tension just keeps ramping up.", "The filmmakers have come up with some images that are sheerest nightmare. The film earns its shudders honestly: Scott is too talented to need gratuitousness as a aid.", "This film is one of the best of its genre. [Full Review in Spanish]", "This gorgeous, leisurely horror film expresses a spectacularly British xenophobia, a parenthetical nightmare of invasion envisioned between an awakening (at the start of the film) and a return to sleep (at its close).", "After 40 years, this sci-fi horror masterpiece still feels lethally contemporary.", "Ridley Scott slowly drains every droplet of hope from his audience as the tension rises in a crescendo, his camera lingering for an age on the crew's desperate faces. Even after multiple watches it remains brutally frightening. (4k restoration)", "Everything shrieks fit to burst, ignoring the poster tagline (\"In space no one can hear you scream\").", "An real classic, that rare case of top cast, top script, top directing, top set and practice effects, everything. In terms of tense sci-fi horrors, it's hard to top Alien.", "So much of filmmaking is a crapshoot, but every once in awhile, the elements pulled together in front of and behind the camera make for a kind of cinematic alchemy. Alien is one of those instances.", "Scream all you want-Alien is eternal.", "Even now, Alien packs a visceral punch...", "What makes it so effectively terrifying is not an urban legend that could spark an ill-advised, teenage-led hunt nor an array of ominous visuals; it is far simpler than that.
