Personally, I have my doubts.", "While the movie dazzles with CGI effects and high-octane action, it is the excellent performances by the trio that make it a must-watch.", "A film more concerned with shock value than actually telling a proper story. [Full review in Spanish]", "Extreme violence, bloodshed are center stage in hit anime.", "Watch Attack On Titan for the tension, the monsters and the gore, but don't expect a plot or characters even remotely as compelling as its animated counterparts.", "The lack of character development also means that people sometimes behave in logic-defying ways.", "This existentialist meditation on free will and murderous impulses may be worthy of Kafka or Camus ... One of the most perversely original fantasy movies in recent memory.", "With the focus on action the character development is sorely underwritten with a whole army of young warriors being shoddily introduced meaning their eventual deaths carry little emotional weight but it sure is mesmerising watching the mayhem unfold.", "The actors are self-conscious and dreadful, but their fringes are undeniably impressive, and the film has a schlocky B-movie appeal, propelled by terrific special effects ...", "If you're a fan of hardcore bonkers cinema, this needs to shoot directly to the top of your must-see list.", "It would have been more fun to have watched the entire cast be eaten by the titans than to have sat through this adaption of Attack on Titan.", "We can only say this is a movie equally disappointing and surprising, vibrant and dumb, eccentric and conservative.
