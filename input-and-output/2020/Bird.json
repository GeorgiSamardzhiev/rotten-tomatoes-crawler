{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Director Clint Eastwood, a noted jazz aficionado, directs this heartfelt study of pioneering bop saxophonist Charlie Parker (Forest Whitaker). Moving forward and backward through Parker's brief life before his death of a heroin overdose at age 34, the film foregrounds the saxophonist's difficult relationship with his wife, Chan Parker (Diane Venora), but also features lengthy scenes of Parker improvising on stage, lit with the neon and cigarette smoke of vintage jazz clubs.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 41m", "director": "Clint Eastwood", "studio": "WarnerBrothers", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 1, 2009", "box_office": "$1.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It is only thanks to Whitaker's performance, which won him a Golden Globe, that we are truly able to bond with Bird and truly care about his lifelong challenges.", "Eastwood directed Bird in much the same way he plays jazz piano-not with caution, not with precision, but with a love that is supreme.", "What the film pulls off is the difficult fusion of this kind of accuracy with larger 'truths' which are no respecter of accuracy.", "\"Bird'' is a movie that demands your full attention, refusing to yield all its meanings if you sit back and let it wash over you.", "In this movie and its hot, fast bursts of bop, Charlie Parker gets a fitting elegy.", "Sensitively acted, beautifully planned visually and dynamite musically, this is a dramatic telling of the troubled life of a revolutionary artist.", "The greatest strength of Clint Eastwood's bio-pic tribute to jazz saxophone great Charlie 'Bird' Parker, is its dark and haunting mood.", "At last American cinema has done black music proud. Unforgettable.", "Eastwood shows a Parker that is haunted by his boyhood addiction, and shows off the innumerable people who loved his talent who were let down by him time and again.", "", "Eastwood made the switch from Hollywood icon to great world director with his viciously underrated Bird.", "Overlong, and reeking of prestige.", "Eastwood clearly is committed to presenting Bird to his audience with all of his complexities and contradictions intact.", "", "Whitaker gives a towering performance as the tortured musical genius, and Venora is equally impressive as the independent, compassionate Chan.", "Bird is less moving as a character study than it is as a tribute and as a labor of love. The portrait it offers, though hazy at times, is one Charlie Parker's admirers will recognize.", "\"a well-produced downer that moves like a funeral procession\"", "", "Reduced to the bare bones of people and plot, the film winds up dancing around the edges of questions it doesn't answer -- straight-ahead rhythm coupled with straight-ahead melody, and not quite enough depth to either one.", "Even though, thematically, the movie won't come clear, Eastwood has succeeded so thoroughly in communicating his love of his subject, and there's such vitality in the performances, that we walk out elated, juiced on the actors and the music."], "rating": ["3.0/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "3.5/5", "3/5", "", "2/5", "7", "3/5", "4/4", "3/5", "2/5", "3/5", "6", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Charles Mudede", "Richard Combs", "David Sterritt", "Michael Wilmington", "Variety Staff", "Urban Cinefile Critics", "", "Brad Laidman", "Philip Martin", "Jeffrey M.
