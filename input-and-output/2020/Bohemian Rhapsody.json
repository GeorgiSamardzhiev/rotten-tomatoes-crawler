{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Freddie Mercury -- the lead singer of Queen -- defies stereotypes and convention to become one of history's most beloved entertainers. The band's revolutionary sound and popular songs lead to Queen's meteoric rise in the 1970s. After leaving the group to pursue a solo career, Mercury reunites with Queen for the benefit concert Live Aid -- resulting in one of the greatest performances in rock 'n' roll history.", "rating": "61", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 15m", "director": "Bryan Singer", "studio": "QueenFilms,20thCenturyFox,GKFilms,NewRegency", "theater_date": "Nov 2, 2018", "dvd_date": "Jan 22, 2019", "box_office": "$216.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Bohemian Rhapsody tells the dramatised history of the influential British rock band, Queen, with the limelight focused firmly on the late frontman, Freddie Mercury.", "So forceful and enthusiastic that it's hard not to get caught up in the momentum and the impact of one of the most enduring groups in rock history.", "The high wire work of Malek and the thrilling concerts sequences will make you fall in love with Queen all over again. While far from perfect, Bohemian Rhapsody was a blast.", "Thanks to the film's aesthetically pleasing musical sequences and Rami Malek's commanding leading performance, it still serves as an adequate reminder of both the band's musical genius and Freddie's one of a kind stage presence.", "The film never really strikes an original note, choosing instead to tap into all the biopic high notes.", "Rami Malek is the movie and the only reason why it stands out, not much beyond his acting. [Full review in Spanish]", "The film clearly has its flaws, rolling out more like a \"Greatest Hits\" compilation than a creative concept album, but the experience is so nostalgically infectious as to be irresistible. Forget the mixed reviews; they're just radio gaga.", "More bubblegum pop than gritty heartbreaking drama, Bohemian Rhapsody may have a few flaws but it is, without a doubt, made for its hardcore fan base. It's engaging, foot-tapping and one all-around rocking respectful party.", "The film is either scared of alienating its audience or can't bring itself to paint Mercury in a light that isn't totally mainstream, but either way, it's shallow.", "Mercury's deeply flawed personality is brilliantly brought out in all its contradictions by Malek.", "Bohemian Rhapsody was made to pay tribute to Freddie, not to explore his personal life. [Full review in Spanish]", "There are a great number of problems with Bohemian Rhapsody, but the passion for and behind the band is front and center, and that occasionally makes it a great deal of fun.", "It is brutally long, rushing to tell the hectic life of Freddie Mercury with very awkward creative decisions and conventional mechanics that make the journey hasty, pointless and with little time for cohesion. [Full review in Spanish]", "As a biopic, Bohemian Rhapsody falls short, failing to adequately examine Mercury's life and the people in it. Malek, who put so much effort into bringing Mercury to life, and who gives such a brilliant performance, deserves better, as does the audience.", "Overall, this is nothing new. Neither good nor bad, but if you approach it from the right angle, it's a lot of fun.", "The film ends on a musical high, accurately capturing the essence of the band's energy but, despite Malek's best efforts, fails to capture the elusiveness of Freddie Mercury.", "Bohemian Rhapsody dives into the struggles that Freddie Mercury went through. Whether you are a Queen fan or not, it makes for a great drama (with awesome music!).", "This is record label-approved hagiography, and those doing the approving seem to see Mercury's sexual orientation as a character flaw he must overcome.", "podcast review", "Though Rami Malek (Mr Robot) obviously poured his heart into the role, he could never have won, given the source material he had to work with."], "rating": ["4/5", "8/10", "", "", "1.5/4", "6/10", "3/4", "4/5", "2/5", "3/5", "", "", "4/10", "", "", "", "4.5/5", "", "B", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Alix Turner", "Mike Massie", "Dan Buffa", "Matthew St. Clair", "Richard Propes", "Victor Pineyro", "Jason Fraley", "Zehra Phelan", "Matt Cipolla", "Saibal Chatterjee", "Ricardo Gallegos", "Steven Prokopy", "Yasser Medina", "David Lamble", "Dan Scully", "Marissa De La Cerda", "Tessa Smith", "Chris McCoy", "Julian Lytle", "Grethe Kemp"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Ready Steady Cut", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Gone With The Twins", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KSDK News (St. Louis)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema Sentries", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Seventh Art Studio", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WTOP (Washington, D.C.)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flavourmag", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Monthly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">NDTV", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">P\u00f3lvora", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Third Coast Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bay Area Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema76", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Mama&#39;s Geeky", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Memphis Flyer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Ignorant Bliss", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">City Press (South Africa)"], "date": ["February 2, 2021", "December 5, 2020", "November 10, 2020", "October 2, 2020", "September 3, 2020", "August 30, 2020", "August 29, 2020", "July 25, 2020", "July 25, 2020", "July 21, 2020", "July 5, 2020", "July 1, 2020", "June 27, 2020", "June 1, 2020", "March 18, 2020", "February 29, 2020", "February 5, 2020", "January 21, 2020", "January 11, 2020", "January 3, 2020"]}}
