But well worth it.", "Handsome; mad; haunting.", "Branded to Kill is a drunken dream of a film; the kind, once slept on, you can't believe you ever really saw.", "'Branded to Kill' is one of those films that feels so far ahead of its time, we may still not have caught up to it. The violence is raw, the sex even more so, and the monochrome photography is flawless.", "Branded To Kill thrums along to an irresistible hard-bop beat, with effortlessly stylish black andwhite cinematography and set-pieces straight from a pulp fiction fever dream.", "The images remain so strong that we wonder whether the overall films began as mental images, unearthed from an artist's psyche to help construct probing popular entertainment.", "Seijun Suzuki doesn't do establishing shots, and when he does, they don't establish s***.", "Because its so free of the conventions of other crime thrillers, that in and of itself is thrilling. The disorienting camera angles and jumps in time are all part of the atmosphere.", "One of the most bizarre movies ever made, a wildly perverse and incredibly stylish one-of-a-kind deconstructionist yakuza thriller.", "Reputedly one of Seijun Suzuki's finest works and unquestionably very stylish in its 'Scope framings (Jim Jarmusch copied a few shots from it in his Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai).", "Occasionally mystifying, but always witty, inventive and dazzling to look at.", "", "", "", "Director Seijun Suzuki melds eastern production values and western crime devices into a film with little inhibition and ample creativity."], "rating": ["", "5/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5", "4/5", "4/5", "5/5", "4/5", "9/10", "8/10", "3.5/4", "3.5/4", "", "", "5/5", "4/5", "5/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Michelle Kisner", "Tara Brady", "Mark Kermode", "David Parkinson", "Peter Bradshaw", "David Jenkins", "Nigel Andrews", "Robbie Collin", "Tom Huddleston", "Ken McIntyre", "Matthew Sorrento", "Christopher Long", "Eric Melin", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Geoff Andrew", "Andy Klein", "Jake Euker", "Aaron Hillis", "Rumsey Taylor"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Movie Sleuth", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Irish Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Observer (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Little White Lies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Financial Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IdentityTheory", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Metropolis", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Kansas City Star", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles CityBeat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">F5 (Wichita, KS)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Premiere Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Not Coming to a Theater Near You"], "date": ["November 6, 2018", "October 9, 2017", "July 26, 2014", "July 25, 2014", "July 24, 2014", "July 24, 2014", "July 24, 2014", "July 24, 2014", "July 23, 2014", "July 21, 2014", "April 5, 2012", "February 3, 2012", "January 13, 2012", "January 9, 2007", "January 9, 2007", "February 9, 2006", "March 24, 2005", "June 12, 2004", "April 23, 2004", "August 19, 2003"]}}
