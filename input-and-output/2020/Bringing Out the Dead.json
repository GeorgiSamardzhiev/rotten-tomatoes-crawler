{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After a disheartening and haunting career wears him down, New York City paramedic Frank Pierce (Nicolas Cage) begins to collapse under the strain of saving lives and witnessing deaths. Through the course of a few nights, three co-workers (John Goodman, Ving Rhames, Tom Sizemore) accompany Pierce as he grasps for sanity and pushes to be fired. Before Pierce falls off the edge, he still has a hope when he forms a friendship with a victim's daughter (Patricia Arquette).", "rating": "72", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 2m", "director": "Martin Scorsese", "studio": "TouchstonePictures,DeFina-Cappa,ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "Oct 22, 1999", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$16.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Somebody let Nic Cage drive an ambulance... and that somebody is Scorsese.

Except now instead of an avenging angel he's on a mission of mercy.", "There is no denying Scorsese is one of American cinema's most astonishing directors, but I honestly think it is high time Bringing Out the Dead was revisited and given another chance.", "I congratulate Martin Scorsese on this miraculous triumph over his personal demons, and pray for the swift recovery of his art.", "A frankly disturbing experience since Cage is at his most manic, the images are brutal, the documentary-style background intense and the (inevitable) theme of redemption a long time emerging.", "Its hard-to-pin-down tone is frighteningly original -- simultaneously world-weary and adolescent with an aura of perpetual anxiety, as if the characters and filmmakers were in pursuit of a catharsis everyone knows will never come.", "Scorsese is married to a script that drags him down, keeps him from taking wing as a pure artist.", "Martin Scorsese is a wonderful filmmaker. And he loves New York. He is at his best, though, when he has an interesting story to tell.", "An exciting, invigorating return to old preoccupations. Welcome home, Marty.", "Of course, it's immaculately crafted and exhilaratingly paced, but in the end it's never as emotionally involving as it could and should be.", "However muddled the story gets, Scorsese guarantees Bringing Out the Dead remains a pulsating trip.", "It's assuredly the work of a master filmmaker.", "It's another burnout role for Nicolas Cage, to which he brings his vast repertoire of grimaces and shuffles, as if he were variously impersonating a gargoyle on amphetamines and late Elvis on downers.", "I don't recommend it, unless you care to see the best Nicolas Cage performance in several years, or some more of Scorcese's brilliant camera work.", "Scorsese doesn't trust the power of simplicity to rock us.", "Everyone looks dead and they speak as if they live in a nightmarish dreamworld. Well, they do.", "A very different and, in many respects, very impressive film.", "Overlooked Martin Scorsese movie has grim humor, grit and grace.", "Give it to Martin Scorsese to keep coming back and hitting one out of the park."], "rating": ["", "", "", "9/10", "", "", "", "3/5", "3/4", "4/5", "", "3/4", "B+", "", "B-", "", "3/4", "", "5/5", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Eve Tushnet", "Anthony Lane", "Sean Burns", "Grant Watson", "Rob Nelson", "", "Lisa Alspector", "Rob Gonsalves", "Joe Lozito", "Ian Freer", "Geoff Andrew", "Jeffrey Westhoff", "Laura Clifford", "Stuart Klawans", "Jeffrey Overstreet", "Peter Rainer", "Judith Egerton", "Kevin Jackson", "James Rocchi", "Kevin N.
