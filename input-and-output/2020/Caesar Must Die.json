But this is the intriguing privilege that the Taviani brothers have given us.", "A clever if sometimes mystifying, combination of documentary, invention and post-modernism.", "Destined to lose years in prison, the actors seem to take pride -- and solace -- in their association with something as seemingly immortal as Shakespeare's words.", "As they find issues and themes they can relate to, the action is never remotely static despite the frequent nature of the close-ups and the plastic sword.", "The problem with the film, which somewhat inexplicably won the Golden Bear at Berlin last year, is that it scarcely transcends the basic novelty of its premise.", "There's barely a wasted moment in the film, which runs a brisk 76 minutes and contains no female roles.", "There's an intensity and emotional accuracy to the performances that's just stunning, particularly Striano's Brutus, as he longs for death and release.", "Profoundly moving.", "The juxtaposition of Shakespearean text and prison cell life is a particularly poignant one.", "It is difficult to understand exactly where documentary ends and fiction begins, but the finale, again in colour, of the triumphant first night of the production can't fail to move.", "It's never anything less than interesting, though I felt it didn't quite fulfil its potential, and the repetition of material at the beginning and end is disconcerting.", "It is uncanny how Italy's film-makers keep failing to nail, or effectively to satirise, their country's strident political shortcomings.", "Deeply felt melancholy lingers long after the credits roll.", "Delivers a compelling and considered take on immemorial themes."], "rating": ["", "", "4/5", "", "", "8/10", "", "3/5", "3.5/4", "4/5", "3/5", "3/4", "A-", "", "4/5", "4/5", "3/5", "2/5", "3/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Geoffrey O&#39;Brien", "J.
