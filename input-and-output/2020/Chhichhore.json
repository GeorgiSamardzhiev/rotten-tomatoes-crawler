What more can one ask for, really?", "It tells you that the journey is far more important than the destination and that losing is as critical a life lesson as winning. The film scores high on many accounts and is certainly worth watching.", "A must-watch with your college friends, Chhichhore is relatable and relevant. Watch it for its uncomplicated screenplay, gripping narrative and some stellar performances that leave you in stitches.", "There are too many draggy patches in between, the acting is inconsistent, and the somewhat superficial messaging adds nothing to the \"what matters is that you tried\" line we have heard before.", "The humour in Chhichhore is so organic that one can forgive the film's contrivances.", "Nitesh Tiwari's Chhichhore is a pleasant entertainer elevated by the strength of its supporting cast. It's also an unabashed acknowledgement of male failure."], "rating": ["", "", "", "", "", "", "3.5/5", "3.5/5", "", "1.7", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Musanna Ahmed", "Nandini Ramnath", "Rachel Saltz", "Sucharita Tyagi", "Anupama Chopra", "Shilpa Jamkhandikar", "Devesh Sharma", "Sreeparna Sengupta", "Monika Rawal Kukreja", "Anna M.M.
