{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Nineteen-year-old \"Strike\" Dunham (Mekhi Phifer) is a small-time street drug dealer for Rodney Little (Delroy Lindo), who wants Strike to kill a former dealer who stole from him. When the man turns up dead, Strike is suspected. But before homicide detective Rocco Klein (Harvey Keitel) has a chance to investigate, Strike's brother, Victor (Isaiah Washington), confesses to the crime -- and Klein suspects that Victor, a virtuous family man, is trying to cover up for Strike.", "rating": "71", "genre": "Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 8m", "director": "Spike Lee", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$13.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A story told with mournful, epic vision that rises high above its grim setting.", "''Clockers'' remains a major work by a major film artist, but its cinematic achievements are diminished by its narrative and psychological shortcomings.", "In many ways, it's better than the book it's taken from: tighter, tauter, with a deeper vein of sadness opening underneath.", "Strong performances, edgy dialogue and Lee's success in luring an audience into his own tempo and urgent perspective make Clockers tough stuff, indeed.", "What all but sinks Clockers is its muddled script, an indulgent mess that is by turns dull and disorienting.", "This harrowing portrait of a young, ulcer- ridden, low-level drug dealer, or \"clocker,\" adds up to the director's best film since \"Do the Right Thing.\"", "\"Clockers\" is as grim as it is good. This is not an\"entertaining\" popcorn- type movie. It's timely. It's tragic in many ways. And it leaves a provocative and lasting impression.", "Lee and Price make sure the piece sufficiently addresses such issues as the devastating effect that criminals have on their own communities and the roles that both cops and crooks can play in tandem with each other.", "Clockers may be Lee's strongest film since Do the Right Thing, but he runs into trouble at the end when he tries to tie up all his threads in neat bows...the passion of this raw, mournful urban epic remains in spite of the false moves.", "There's no denying the movie's greatness: the depth of the characters, the urgency of its narrative, the nightmarishness of its vision.", "Clockers leaves you with a sense of aching sadness, a regretful melancholy for the lives that have been blasted and the wrong decisions that have been made. Once again, Spike Lee has done the right thing.", "Lee has jettisoned most of his trademark technical razzmatazz; it's as if he were trying to burn straight through to the heart of his material.", "Spike Lee brings way too much baggage for the movie to work.", "Lee's film never recaptures the impact of the opening credit sequence, a grimly deglamorized tableaux of real-life crime scenes.", "There is a force and focus in Lee's work, an absence of intellectual posturing and a willingness to let his material speak for itself that he has not achieved before.", "Average Lee, but still enjoyable overall.", "Arguably Lee's best film since Do The Right Thing.", "The performances are strong, but the spectator often feels adrift in an overly busy intrigue.", "A study of the urban dope-dealing culture and its toll on everyone who comes in contact with it, the picture has an insider's feel that is constantly undercut by the filmmaker's impulse to editorialize.", "Spike Lee gets a good perfromance from newcomer Phifer as the young crack dealer, but the movie is diffuse, paying too much attention to the urban environment and not enough to the personas and dilemmas of the central characters."], "rating": ["", "", "4/4", "B+", "", "3.5/4", "", "3.5/4", "", "", "4/4", "A", "2.5/5", "2.5/4", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "C+"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Janet Maslin", "David Sterritt", "Michael Wilmington", "Steve Persall", "Rod Dreher", "Malcolm Johnson", "Carol Buckland", "Matt Brunson", "David Ansen", "Jason Bailey", "Joe Leydon", "Owen Gleiberman", "Matthew Pejkovic", "", "Richard Schickel", "Angie Errigo", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Todd McCarthy", "Emanuel Levy"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Christian Science Monitor", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Tampa Bay Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hartford Courant", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CNN.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Frenzy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Newsweek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flavorwire", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Moving Picture Show", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Entertainment Weekly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Matt&#39;s Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TIME Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com"], "date": ["April 9, 2020", "April 9, 2020", "April 9, 2020", "April 9, 2020", "April 9, 2020", "April 9, 2020", "April 9, 2020", "February 15, 2020", "February 26, 2018", "August 16, 2016", "July 18, 2014", "September 7, 2011", "July 6, 2010", "September 22, 2008", "September 22, 2008", "September 22, 2008", "September 22, 2008", "September 22, 2008", "June 9, 2008", "February 18, 2008"]}}
