{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A philistine in the art film business, Jeremy Prokosch (Jack Palance) is a producer unhappy with the work of his director. Prokosch has hired Fritz Lang (as himself) to direct an adaptation of \"The Odyssey,\" but when it seems that the legendary filmmaker is making a picture destined to bomb at the box office, he brings in a screenwriter (Michel Piccoli) to energize the script. The professional intersects with the personal when a rift develops between the writer and his wife (Brigitte Bardot).", "rating": "93", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 43m", "director": "Jean-Luc Godard", "studio": "RomeParisFilms,CompagniaCinematograficaChampion", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 20, 2016", "box_office": "$40.6K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This veiled criticism of dubbed sound in Italian movies, along with Lang's explanation of unity in Homer, mirrors the couple's break.", "Predictably underwhelming...", "Classic Godard, and a major cornerstone of the French New Wave.", "\"Contempt\" transports us back to another era: an early '60s world in which the classicism of the past...is juxtaposed with the emptiness and ennui of modern culture.", "The film is about nothing but cinema itself, which gets a bit wearing, unless you are one of those people who like watching a movie in order to check off the references to other movies.
