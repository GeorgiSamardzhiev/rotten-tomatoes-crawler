Nevertheless, the film is definitely worth seeing for its cast, the shock of the disclosure and its unexpected finale.", "Creepy suffers from an inconsistent tone and unbelievable plot developments.", "Creepy is worth checking out for those looking for a creepy (sorry) good time.", "Part psychological crime procedural and part domestic drama, Creepy marks another reinvention for Kurosawa as a filmmaker, delivering his best film in years.", "One of the best horror films of the year and probably the best serial killer film of the last decade, Creepy is Kurosawa's greatest achievement and Japanese genre cinema at its finest.", "\"Creepy\" peels back social conventions to reveal the uncanny that lays under the placid fact that we all live among strangers.", "[Director Kiyoshi] Kurosawa's approach to horror - quiet, calm, collected scenes of quotidian normality laced by that lingering feeling of something wicked this way coming - feels refreshingly out of touch.", "Little that happens in Creepy is surprising, but even less is unsatisfying.", "Weaving together two narratives which gradually converge, Kurosawa keeps turning the screws, aided by a deliciously unsettling performance from Kagawa.", "A film full of suspense with an absorbing narration and that goes far in its macabre fantasy of corpses. [Full review in Spanish]", "This is a film that successfully balances its pulpier genre trappings with a haunting meditation on the nature of 21st century relationships-with our neighbors, our friends, our spouses, and ourselves-and dares us to interrogate what we find.", "Something nasty in the woodwork?
