{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Best friends Richard Bone (Jeff Bridges) and Alex Cutter (John Heard) are two middle-class guys living in an upper-class town. The Santa Barbara buddies get dragged into a murder mystery when Richard accidentally spots a man ditching a body into a trash can. Alex, an embittered Vietnam veteran who lost an eye and leg in the war, thinks what Richard saw is worth something, especially when it comes out that the potential murderer is a wealthy and powerful man in the community.", "rating": "91", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Ivan Passer", "studio": "GurianEntertainment", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 12, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Richly compelling.", "...as damning an indictment of American society and post-Vietnam disillusionment as anything produced by New Hollywood...", "Cutter's Way is at once an American film of its time and for all ensuing times, an ugly-truth endeavor examining a nation in which the rich and powerful literally get away with murder while the poor and pitiful barely exist at all.", "An inspiring film, it is constructed like a thriller; but instead of reaching for thrills, it leaves them in the background and concentrates on the complexities of its characters.", "Almost as impressive as Polanski's Chinatown and an extraordinary change of gear from one of the fine Czech New Wave's most notable alumni.", "[Heard] is one of America's great lost actors.", "", "The film moves with an easy uncoerced swing: moment by moment, scene by scene, we are unsure what to think or where we are going. It is a fascinating, organically grown drama.", "An underrated classic.", "Passer continued his wayward career without ever producing anything quite like Cutter again. It's a one-off, a largely overlooked shining gem. Do yourself a favour.", "Cutter and Bone are seriously unlikeable characters, yet Czech \u00e9migr\u00e9 director Ivan Passer and writer Jeffrey Alan Fiskin make us see light in these hearts of darkness.", "Exceptional script, direction and performances make this elliptical neo-noir a forgotten classic.", "Like the '70s output of Pakula and Lumet, Ivan Passer's tense thriller stands as a classy monument to the paranoia of post-Watergate America.", "The three leads are on outstanding form, while Jack Nitzsche's score shimmers with foreboding.", "Paranoid crime thriller.", "Suffers from a terminal case of creative indecision.", "This anatomy of intimate male camaraderie in the post-Vietnam War era could have been more resonant if the tale didn't include a routine murder mystery, which diffuses the otherwise beautifully acted (particularly Jeff Bridges) and shot saga.", "The result is nothing less than a modern masterpiece, and a film ripe for rediscovery.", "It's the sort of picture that never wants to concede what it's about. It is, however, enchanted by the sound of its own dialogue, which is vivid without being informative or even amusing on any level.", ""], "rating": ["", "7/10", "3.5/4", "4/4", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "4/5", "", "4/5", "5/5", "4/5", "5/5", "B", "", "B-", "5/5", "", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Karen Krebsbach", "Nathanael Hood", "Matt Brunson", "", "Derek Malcolm", "Antonia Quirke", "Jennie Kermode", "Peter Bradshaw", "David Gritten", "Mark Stafford", "Tom Hutchinson", "Anton Bitel", "David Parkinson", "Philip Kemp", "Dennis Schwartz", "Variety Staff", "Emanuel Levy", "Tom Huddleston", "Vincent Canby", "Walter Chaw"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sojourner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Retro Set", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Loafing", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">London Evening Standard", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Financial Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Eye for Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Electric Sheep", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Little White Lies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dennis Schwartz Movie Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Freak Central"], "date": ["August 16, 2019", "December 28, 2018", "May 7, 2016", "January 31, 2015", "June 24, 2011", "June 24, 2011", "June 24, 2011", "June 23, 2011", "June 23, 2011", "June 23, 2011", "June 23, 2011", "June 23, 2011", "June 6, 2011", "May 31, 2011", "July 14, 2010", "March 26, 2009", "April 27, 2007", "February 9, 2006", "August 30, 2004", "July 3, 2003"]}}
