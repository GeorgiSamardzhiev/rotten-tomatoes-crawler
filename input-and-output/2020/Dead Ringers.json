{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Elliot (Jeremy Irons), a successful gynecologist, works at the same practice as his identical twin, Beverly (also Irons). Elliot is attracted to many of his patients and has affairs with them. When he inevitably loses interest, he will give the woman over to Beverly, the meeker of the two, without the woman knowing the difference. Beverly falls hard for one of the patients, Claire (Genevi\u00e8ve Bujold), but when she inadvertently deceives him, he slips into a state of madness.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Drama/Horror/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "David Cronenberg", "studio": "MorganCreekProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 22, 2016", "box_office": "$8.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Minor pacing issues aside, Dead Ringers boasts a fantastic dual lead performance from Jeremy Irons.", "A creepy classic...", "\"Dead Ringers\" is by no means a date movie. This is one effed up little horror flick.", "[Irons'] performance no doubt exhausted the actor more than it impresses the audience.", "Irons' performance as the tormented twins is a tour de force. So is Cronenberg's complex camera work.", "Dead Ringers may be a beautifully structured and well-acted movie, but it certainly's isn't an easy film to watch. Still, if you like horror movies, this one will keep you on the edge of your seat, albeit squirming every minute.", "In a weird variation of the Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde theme, the Mantles are drawn relentlessly and frighteningly towards an inevitable and appalling fate.", "This is arguably David Cronenberg's masterpiece.", "Irons gives a highly accomplished performance in a chilly knife-swapping psychodrama that remains among the director's leanest, meanest releases.", "Director David Cronenberg handles his usual fondness for gore in muted style.", "People like myself who find the character played by [Genevieve] Bujold (in one of her best performances) more interesting than either of the twins are bound to feel rather frustrated by the end.", "Impeccably executed, Cronenberg's first masterpiece is an unsettling film in which biological horror is entirely conveyed through pyschological exploration of character, masterfully played by Jeremy Irons in the best performance of his career.", "It's one of Cronenberg's more complex relationship tales, that puts a deadly spin on separation, loss and hopeless love.", "Cronenberg and Irons achieve perfection in horror.", "An intense psychological drama which confronts [Cronenberg's] familiar preoccupations -- fear of physical and mental disintegration, mortality, the power struggle between the sexes -- without the paradoxical protection of visceral disgust.", "Irons is startlingly off-kilter, his performance a veritable textbook example of deranged if icy brilliance", "Dead Ringers is not a fun or particularly upbeat film, but it does grab you by the collar and it sucks you right into the screen.", "", "", "One of Cronenberg's creepiest.
