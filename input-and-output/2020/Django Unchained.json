{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Two years before the Civil War, Django (Jamie Foxx), a slave, finds himself accompanying an unorthodox German bounty hunter named Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz) on a mission to capture the vicious Brittle brothers. Their mission successful, Schultz frees Django, and together they hunt the South's most-wanted criminals. Their travels take them to the infamous plantation of shady Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), where Django's long-lost wife (Kerry Washington) is still a slave.", "rating": "87", "genre": "Drama/Western", "runtime": "2h 45m", "director": "Quentin Tarantino", "studio": "ABandApart", "theater_date": "Dec 25, 2012", "dvd_date": "Mar 24, 2017", "box_office": "$162.8M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Django is another example of Tarantino looking at cultural American history through the lens of privilege, twisting truth and fiction through a grotesque, funhouse mirror.", "Django Unchained is a miserable work, implausible and unconvincing from beginning to end (unlike the best \"spaghetti Westerns\" Tarantino claims to admire).", "Christoph Waltz once again turns in a performance (largely due to the writing) that is astoundingly likeable and worthy of award consideration.", "There's a lot of lunacy in Django Unchained.", "Django Unchained may cross the line in its excess, but all the while, it remains consistently riveting up to its spectacular end.", "Tarantino accomplishes what he set out to do, make a fun, violent, badass spaghetti western. He brings together the classic aesthetics of the genre, with his modern, pop culture saturated sensibilities, and his whip smart dialogue.", "Is another great film from Tarantino that reflects the level of maturity his cinema has reached. [Full review in Spanish]", "A loose-cannon Best Picture pick.", "Tarantino designed this revisionist western to blow people's gaskets. Packed with physical comedy, bloody action and hell-bent revenge, it looks like a classic widescreen Sergio Leone western...", "Django is another gem in Tarantino's crown.", "Django Unchained is bold, hysterical, entertaining, brutal and daring, it is another masterpiece from the present-master of the western, Quentin Tarantino.", "On the surface, Django Unchained is your standard revenge fairy tale, but it has a mean streak that enhances every aspect of the experience. Equal parts electrifying and hard to watch, its joyously liberating ending sticks the explosive landing", "Waltz has a way of being flamboyant and staid at the same time that makes him mesmerizing to watch.", "Fans of Tarantino won't come away disappointed, but he can do a lot better than this.", "Waltz is nearly as good here as he was in \"Basterds\" -- providing \"Django\" with the true heart and soul of the film. Foxx hits the right notes as Django, while DiCaprio is clearly having fun playing way against type.", "everything I wanted it to be: a kick-ass tale of revenge with amazing performances from its leads, smart chunks of dialog punctuated by action, blood-spattered gun fights ...", "A supremely entertaining, richly cinematic treat, which manages to work in some fun (and often very humorous) genre subversions and engaging character nuance amongst the frenetic gunplay.", "If you are a Tarantino fan, a '70s Western fan, a fan of any or all of the actors involved or even just want a bloody, rousing, disturbing, crazy time at the movies, Django Unchained is here to provide it all.", "Quentin Tarantino's latest film is a deliciously entertaining revenge fantasy set in the American South just a couple years before the Civil War.", "In some of the longer scenes, Tarantino gives the impression he's feeling for a touch of his old dialogue gold dust, yet it never really quite comes off."], "rating": ["4/5", "", "7/10", "3.5/4", "A", "A-", "8/10", "", "", "4.5/5", "5/5", "", "", "7/10", "A-", "", "5/5", "B+", "2.5/4", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Tony Black", "David Walsh", "Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "Brent McKnight", "Yasser Medina", "David Lamble", "Anne Thompson", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Ben Rolph", "Robert Kojder", "Leslie Combemale", "C.J.
