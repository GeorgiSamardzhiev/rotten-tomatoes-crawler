{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Dr. John Dolittle lives in solitude behind the high walls of his lush manor in 19th-century England. His only companionship comes from an array of exotic animals that he speaks to on a daily basis. But when young Queen Victoria becomes gravely ill, the eccentric doctor and his furry friends embark on an epic adventure to a mythical island to find the cure.", "rating": "14", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Stephen Gaghan", "studio": "UniversalPictures,PerfectWorldPictures,TeamDowney", "theater_date": "Jan 17, 2020", "dvd_date": "Mar 24, 2020", "box_office": "$77.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Downey brings a sense of bemused confusion, topped with a mealy-mouthed Billy Connolly impression that changes from scene to scene. It's a pantomime performance that makes the best of his finely tuned comic timing but feels sloppy and needlessly mannered.", "The story is silly and hyperbolic. The performances are manic, at times ... But Dolittle is sure to charm a new generation of kids willing to take a journey into a magical world of talking animals and their one-of-a-kind hero.", "The story is barely comprehensible, clearly patched together after extensive reshoots, and the final result is a bloated, expensive mess.", "The film lacks energy and proves to be nothing more than a collection of questionable narrative and acting choice that results in a movie that's a laughable bore", "Dolittle isn't even good-bad. It's just bad-bad.", "Much of Dolittle is dull and makes little narrative sense and judging by the reactions of the kids in my theatre, at times a tad too dark and kind of boring.", "There are problems all over the shop here, with almost every story turn truncated and rushed as if the narrative has been repeatedly chopped, reshaped and tangled.", "A spectacularly ugly exercise in focus-groupthink that tries to please everyone, and thus inevitably pleases no one.", "His beloved Tony Stark sarcasm is nowhere to be found, nor is it replaced by a Robin Williams zaniness or a Gene Wilder twinkle in the eye. Instead, he collects a paycheck like a disinterested Johnny Depp, mumbling in a weird accent that's hard to hear.", "Dolittle isn't a terrible film. It's just a terribly generic film in an era when we've been bombarded with kids-oriented movies that have talking animals.", "How does one find inspiration to review a movie that lacks ambition to be anything more than just \"okay?\"", "Often hard to understand and easy to laugh at, Downey Jr.'s Dolittle interpretation doesn't just fail to lift up a poor film; he helps it sink instead.", "What should have been a magical and epic adventure ends up shipwrecked by a rushed script and flat comedy with an over-reliance on fart jokes and anachronistic dialogue.", "Dolittle announces itself as an adventure comedy, yet the adventure is nascent and the comedy is tedious.", "Dolittle is slow, predictable, and RDJ is extremely hard to understand. But kids will love the potty humor and talking animals, so there is that.", "Other than the promising storybook-like animated prologue narrated by Emma Thompson, who voiced Polynesia the parrot, the rest of the movie quickly nosedives and barely recovers.", "I wouldn't recommend it", "It wasn't good...but at least it wasn't boring!", "So bad it's bad.", "In a world of Tiger King, I'll still take Dolittle any day."], "rating": ["2/5", "", "3/10", "2.0/4", "", "", "2/5", "1/5", "2.5/4", "", "B-", "F", "", "", "1.5/5", "1/5", "", "", "", "2/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Candice McMillan", "Jennifer Heaton", "Charles Koplinski", "John Serba", "Robert Slack", "Tom Beasley", "Daniel Barnes", "Jason Fraley", "Carla Hay", "Allen Almachar", "Dan Buffa", "Damond Fudge", "Andrew Kendall", "Tessa Smith", "Casey Chong", "Andrew Galdi", "Avaryl Halley", "Evan Dossey", "Tania Lamb"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KOMO News (Seattle)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Alternative Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Talk with Chuck and Pam", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Decider", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">SooToday.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">VultureHound", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Dare Daniel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">WTOP (Washington, D.C.)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Culture Mix", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KSDK News (St. Louis)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KCCI (Des Moines, IA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Stabroek News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Mama&#39;s Geeky", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Casey&#39;s Movie Mania", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Bitches", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Midwest Film Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Lola Lambchops"], "date": ["January 30, 2021", "January 28, 2021", "January 15, 2021", "November 27, 2020", "November 17, 2020", "October 19, 2020", "August 16, 2020", "July 21, 2020", "July 18, 2020", "July 13, 2020", "July 8, 2020", "July 5, 2020", "June 27, 2020", "May 4, 2020", "April 15, 2020", "April 14, 2020", "April 9, 2020", "April 9, 2020", "April 9, 2020", "April 8, 2020"]}}
