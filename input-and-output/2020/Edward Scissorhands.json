{"metadata": {"synopsis": "A scientist (Vincent Price) builds an animated human being -- the gentle Edward (Johnny Depp). The scientist dies before he can finish assembling Edward, though, leaving the young man with a freakish appearance accentuated by the scissor blades he has instead of hands. Loving suburban saleswoman Peg (Dianne Wiest) discovers Edward and takes him home, where he falls for Peg's teen daughter (Winona Ryder). However, despite his kindness and artistic talent, Edward's hands make him an outcast.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Drama/Science Fiction & Fantasy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Tim Burton", "studio": "TwentiethCenturyFox", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Nov 21, 2014", "box_office": "$54.2M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Long a courageous actor, Depp inhabits a character that by all accounts should have been a freak or caricature.", "One-of-a-kind fairytale for adults from director Tim Burton.", "Watching the film is like turning the pages of a small child's book which has very pretty pictures and two lines of large print spelling out the story.", "With Burton's surreal illustrative ingenuity, Depp and Ryder's career-making performances, and a story filled with simplicity, complexity, and intangible wizardry that stands the test of time, Edward Scissorhands is one of the greatest films ever made.", "Depp cuts a haunting figure, while Wiest is typically excellent. The rest of the actors are forced to play characters who are either underdeveloped or overcooked, and the broadness of Burton's approach eventually leads to a wholly unsatisfying resolution.", "Burton's modern fairytale has an almost palpably personal feel: it is told gently, subtly and with infinite sympathy for an outsider who charms the locals but then inadvertently arouses their baser instincts.", "Between this masterpiece and that other Ed (Wood), TIm Burton and Johnny Depp are at their dual-career best. Ed Wood is about how insane Hollywood is -- and Edward Scissorhands delivers the pure magic that, once in a rare while, escapes the place.", "...perhaps the cinema's most enchanting parable about the misunderstood and alienated artist.", "... this sweet 1990 fantasy ... for the first time crystallized the latent themes in the director's work: the notion of the artist as outsider, of skills that make one special but at the same time different.", "An original movie, though not Tim Burton's best.", "A delightful and delicate comic fable.", "Fine performances all around, particularly from Depp and the immensely sympathetic Wiest.", "Visually, stylistically and emotionally stunning.", "It's visually pleasing and an easy film to like, even if it never gets out of shallow water as far as its story goes.", "[Burton and Depp] seem to bring out the best in each other.", "Burton's movies are fairytales for retarding evolution.", "It remains curiously hollow.", "His gothic tones always mask a feeling of wonder and an endearing love for everything that is possible in life and death", "Burton's sweet Gothic fairy tale has lost none of its charm.", ""], "rating": ["3.5/4", "4/5", "", "", "2.5/4", "5/5", "", "4/4", "", "", "", "4/4", "4.5/5", "B", "4/4", "3/4", "", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Leigh Paatsch", "Harriet Waugh", "Alex Arabian", "Matt Brunson", "Marc Lee", "Gregory Weinkauf", "Josh Larsen", "Steve Biodrowski", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Variety Staff", "", "", "Dennis Schwartz", "Jeffrey M.
