{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Baron Frankenstein (Udo Kier) dreams of restoring Serbia to glory, so he builds male and female monsters whose children will become the new master race. Determined that they be fruitful, he aims to equip the male body with the brain of someone possessing a powerful libido. Thinking local stable boy Nicholas (Joe Dallesandro) will be perfect, he mistakenly gets the head of Nicholas' pious friend (Srdjan Zelenovic) instead. Meanwhile, Nicholas seduces the baron's wife (Monique van Vooren).", "rating": "86", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Horror/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 34m", "director": "Paul Morrissey, Anthony M.
