It's fantastically written, parodying fandom with much love and affection, and so well performed by a cast of total icons.", "Everyone has their own specific definition of comfort food. Dean Parisot's pitch-perfect send-up/embrace of Star Trek fandom sits near the top of my list.", "With such an entertaining cast and premise, it's no wonder the film has found a cult status that ironically mirrors its own satirizing of fandom and waning stardom.", "There is a lot to love about Galaxy Quest, from its hilarious comedy to its dynamic characters to its fascinating take on sci-fi fandom.", "Galaxy Quest is dumbfounded by the devotion of the obsessive fan. And yet it treats SF fanatics with so much exasperated affection and respect that no Trekker could take offense at the ribbing.", "What helps drive Galaxy Quest home is that this film really is a love letter to sci-fi fans.", "The idea behind Galaxy Quest is a terrific one -- it's just too bad the movie never quite fulfills its promise or its premise.", "While Galaxy Quest starts off like any other parody, it morphs into a truly human story about people, their humanity, their fragility, and their insecurities.", "It's a warm, appealing comedy filled with well-realized characters and jokes ranging from the wry to the slapstick-y.", "Galaxy Quest is instead an affectionate and warmhearted send-up that celebrates the convention/sci-fi subculture it perceptively parodies.", "A one-joke sci-fi comedy.", "The film never really bloats or sags, and remains utterly pleasurable throughout its entire running time.", "A fantastic science fiction comedy", "", "Hilarious, fast, funny, fresh fun for the family.", "Galaxy Quest works not just as a parody or a send-up of a type of film. It works as a basic space adventure as well.", "Before Tropic Thunder, there came this clever and satisfying spoof of \"Star Trek\" and its enduing fan phenomenon.", "Despite a premise that sounds far from promising, GALAXY QUEST turns out to be an amusing adventure that ofers both good comedy and reasonably exciting science fiction.", "While gently spoofing the old Star Trek series and honoring it, Galaxy Quest creates and inhabits its own uniquely lovable universe.", "An enormously entertaining pop-culture ride."], "rating": ["", "", "7/10", "9/10", "", "5/5", "2.5/4", "4.5/5", "", "", "B-", "7/10", "", "A-", "4/5", "4/5", "", "", "8/10", "5/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Charlotte Harrison", "Norman Wilner", "Mike Massie", "Johnny Gayzmonic", "Kathi Maio", "Danielle Solzman", "Matt Brunson", "Allison Rose", "Keith Phipps", "Ben Lindbergh", "Dennis Schwartz", "Tim Brayton", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Lisa Schwarzbaum", "Nell Minow", "Kevin Carr", "Jeffrey M.
