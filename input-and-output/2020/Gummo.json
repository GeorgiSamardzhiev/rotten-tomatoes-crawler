{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Teen friends Tummler (Nick Sutton) and Solomon (Jacob Reynolds) navigate the ruins of a tiny, tornado-ravaged town in Ohio that is populated by the deformed, disturbed and perverted. When not gunning down stray cats for a few bucks, the boys pass their time getting stoned on household inhalants. Elsewhere, the mute Bunny Boy (Jacob Sewell) dons rabbit ears and is bullied by kids half his age, and sisters Dot (Chloe Sevigny) and Helen (Carisa Glucksman) dodge a pedophile.", "rating": "38", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama/Special Interest", "runtime": "1h 28m", "director": "Harmony Korine", "studio": "IndependentPictures,FineLineFeatures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 20, 2001", "box_office": "$87.4K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["This makes it impossible to measure \"Gummo\" using the traditional quality metrics, and leaves us simply asking whether it works or does not. It works.", "A film of challenge that requires a viewer to go beyond passive viewing into very actively experiencing the film.", "If only the director didn't see the rest of humanity as found art, and himself as its appraisor!", "Somehow, often within a single scene or image, [Gummo] manages to be simultaneously indefensible, dismissible, exploitive, heartbreaking and completely revivifying.", "Like a kid acting up for attention, the wise-ass Korine wants desperately to be in your face - to offend and provoke. And he does a damn good job getting his way. If for no other reason, \"Gummo\" deserves to be seen.", "Gummo is a towering achievement largely because it is that metaphorical snuff film.", "After his persuasively disturbing screenplay for Larry Clark's Kids, Harmony Korine 's Gummo comes as a disappointment.", "The unyielding and uncomfortable manner in which Gummo grapples with human diversity has also allowed it to linger long in the memory.", "Is the perspective of youth in this country really so devoid of significance, and their existence so septic? These are good questions, although \"Gummo\" provides neither answer nor solution, nor even thematic cohesion.", "The point of all this nihilism and grotesqueness? You got me.", "Different viewers might find different portions worthy of anything from zero to four stars, but anyone with a faint heart or weak stomach should stay miles away from it.", "Take away the shock value, and there isn't much there: just a stylistically promising student film peddling bargain-basement surreal nihilism that, stretched over 90 minutes, grows awfully tedious.", "Virtually plotless, the movie does its best to be offensive, but not in the service of any particular theme.", "Instead, [Gummo is] a gaudy, reckless collage of perverse images that lack any value.", "A close-up portrait of disaffected youth in Middle America, Gummo is one of the most repellent cinematic efforts in recent memory.", "Korine penetrates the heart and sears the intellect, leaving behind a very potent mark indeed.", "Anger is more likely to be directed at the director's perceived lack of moral position on this subject matter.", "[A] brattily repellent, hell-bent-for-shock collection of vignettes about the perils of boredom in suburban America.", "A glue-sniffer's reverie and an aestheticized episode of Beavis & Butthead, explicitly and bracingly set up as an act of cinematic vandalism", "Gummo aims to be provocatively anti-everything: anti-Christian, anti-feline, non-narrative, unpolished, visually dyslexic, and imaginatively off-putting."], "rating": ["3/4", "3.0/4", "", "", "", "", "", "", "", "0/4", "2/4", "", "", "0/4", "", "4/5", "", "F", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Matthew Rozsa", "Richard Propes", "Jim Ridley", "Patrick Dahl", "V.A.
