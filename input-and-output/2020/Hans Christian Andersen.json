{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Imaginative cobbler Hans Christian Andersen (Danny Kaye) is asked to leave his hometown because his frequent stories are distracting the children from school. From there he moves to Copenhagen, Denmark, where he sees and falls in love with Doro (Jeanmaire), a ballerina. He writes \"The Little Mermaid\" for her, and it becomes the ballet's latest work. However, Doro is already married to Niels (Farley Granger), meaning Hans must content himself with producing popular children's stories.", "rating": "83", "genre": "Classics/Kids & Family/Musical & Performing Arts/Romance", "runtime": "2h", "director": "Charles Vidor", "studio": "SamuelGoldwynCompany,TheSee", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 28, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Danny Kaye is refreshingly re strained in the title role, and Jeanmaire is excellent while dancing.", "This largely fictionalized musical biopic of the famous writer was one of Danny Kaye's most popular films, nominated for multiple Oscars.", "", "", "As with all Danny Kaye movies my response is to wish for a tranqulizer gun", ""], "rating": ["", "B-", "4/5", "3/5", "2/5", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Bob Thomas", "Emanuel Levy", "Carol Cling", "Philip Martin", "Ken Hanke", "Bob Grimm"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Las Vegas Review-Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Arkansas Democrat-Gazette", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Mountain Xpress (Asheville, NC)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Las Vegas Mercury"], "date": ["July 24, 2019", "June 7, 2012", "January 23, 2004", "December 30, 2002", "August 22, 2002", "August 1, 2002"]}}
