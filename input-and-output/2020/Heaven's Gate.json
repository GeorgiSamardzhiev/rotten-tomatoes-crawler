{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Harvard graduate James Averill (Kris Kristofferson) is the sheriff of prosperous Jackson County, Wyo., when a battle erupts between the area's poverty-stricken immigrants and its wealthy cattle farmers. The politically connected ranch owners fight the immigrants with the help of Nathan Champion (Christopher Walken), a mercenary competing with Averill for the love of local madam Ella Watson (Isabelle Huppert).

[Full Review in Spanish]", "Neither Kris Kristofferson nor Christopher Walken, both of them fine actors, can prevail against the relentless scale and movement of the production.", "It is a bloated Western that contains some extraordinary moments, a lot of heavy-handed political commentary and a hell of a lot of padding.", "Enormous, but also gorgeous in its enormity.", "The first critics to lay eyes on it mistook the emphasis on the personal and painterly for self-indulgence - static naval gazing. This confuses incident with the incidental.", "I will leave others to pick nits off this epic panorama.", "It is a demanding film, without a doubt - but a passionate one.", "Cimino endows the visuals with a Zola-esque texture and realism. But the characterisation and dramatic reach go beyond even that.", "Emotionally stings like few other westerns.", "Its status as a true wonder-work of American cinema is now surely beyond doubt.", "The set-pieces are majestic and its disenchanted view of the american frontier myth still rings ominously true.", "On a purely sensory level, Heaven's Gate is overpowering.", "If anything, Michael Cimino's inert disaster of a Western has gotten worse over the years ...", "Michael Cimino's film represented a slight return to classicism--to larger-than-life Panavision spectacle and crane shot-managed majesty, however contradicted by narrative bleakness.", "I like Heaven's Gate just fine, but I don't love it.
