{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this Western, a drifter with no name (Clint Eastwood) wanders into a small town, where his gun-slinging abilities are in high demand. When the drifter rides into Lago, he is met with incredulity and disapproval by the townspeople. But once he shows his skills with a pistol, the locals realize he may be able to help them fend off a band of criminals who have been terrorizing the town. He agrees to help the townspeople, but does so with his own secret agenda.", "rating": "93", "genre": "Classics/Drama/Western", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "Clint Eastwood", "studio": "UniversalPictures,TheMalpasoCompany", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "May 7, 2015", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A better black comedy-cum-allegory in which Eastwood (as both actor and director) expanded on the spaghetti template.", "HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is perhaps Eastwood's most mean-spirited film that deals with supernatural elements and quite literally burning down every cliche, the Western cliche that had predated \"The Man With No Name.", "A shaky sophomore effort for Eastwood. Ernest Tidyman's script all too often plays like an extended -- and inferior -- episode of The Twilight Zone.", "Mysterious, sporadically comical, and classically Eastwood, High Plains Drifter is a wholly satisfying revenge saga that's askew enough to surprise as it exercises known elements.", "Eastwood holds fast to the rebel spirit of the spaghetti Westerns and revisionist \"New Hollywood\" Westerns of the previous decade, but packages it in a film that's slicker and more mainstream-friendly.", "Clint Eastwood's first Western as director is rather fascinating due to its quasi-supernatural component.", "As a director, Eastwood is not as good as he seems to think he is. As an actor, he is probably better than he allows himself to be.", "One of the best Westerns of the 1970s.", "Whatever the reasoning, it is a gripping work, harsh and ahead of its time.", "Eastwood's second directorial effort is mechanically stylish.", "", "Eastwood registers strongly as actor and director of this revenge Western (yet another critique of High Noon), with a style that's influenced by his mentors, the economic efficiency of Don Siegel with touches of Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns", "This was supposed to be Eastwood's fond adieu to the worlds of Sergio Leone and Don Siegel; and indeed he cuts the operatic excess of the former with the punchy economy of the latter.", "Clint Eastwood is the ultimate thinking man's cinematic killing machine.", "Savory Eastwood western.", "Part ghost story, part revenge Western, more than a little silly, and often quite entertaining in a way that may make you wonder if you have lost your good sense.", "Clint Eastwood's second film as a director -- and his first western -- is a minor classic.", "Clint's a supernatural amoral mythical hero (of the pulp novel kind), bent on cruelty and getting revenge for a past misdeed.", "", "Paint the town red, Clint.
