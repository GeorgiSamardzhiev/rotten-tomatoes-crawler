{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Following his great success with \"North by Northwest,\" director Alfred Hitchcock (Anthony Hopkins) makes a daring choice for his next project: an adaptation of Robert Bloch's novel \"Psycho.\" When the studio refuses to back the picture, Hitchcock decides to pay for it himself in exchange for a percentage of the profits. His wife, Alma Reville (Helen Mirren), has serious reservations about the film but supports him nonetheless. Still, the production strains the couple's marriage.", "rating": "60", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 38m", "director": "Sacha Gervasi", "studio": "FoxSearchlight,Dune,MontecitoPictureCompany", "theater_date": "Dec 14, 2012", "dvd_date": "Dec 12, 2015", "box_office": "$6.0M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Most closely resembling a romantic comedy, the film's tone keeps the proceedings consistently entertaining, but also prevents intrusion of any serious drama.", "As marvelous as is Hopkins, the film simply wouldn't be the same without the presence of Helen Mirren as Hitchcock's longtime companion Alma Reville.", "As it turns out, few of the remarkable filmmaker's most interesting concerns or characteristics manage to break their way into Hitchcock.", "Hitchcock may have right intentions in mind but not the best execution.", "His obsessive nature is one of the things that makes Hitchcock such a mysterious figure. But we don't learn anything about what made him tick here.", "What's ironic is that Psycho was such a radical, cinematographically novel film, but Gervasi is completely unable to find a meta-referential way of honouring that.", "Even if you've never seen a Hitchcock film in your life, it's worth seeing for the performances alone.", "If you're interested in Hitchcock's domestic life, this film is for you. But don't expect to learn much about the man in the director's chair.", "Would have been much better off if it had taken a moment to sit down and decide on its own sensibility... It might have settled on the one, and retained its focus. But it didn't, so it doesn't, and it tells us nothing.", "It's insulting to the Hitchcocks and to the audience.", "A slimly plotted, rather shallow film about an important director that barely shows him directing.", "The plot trundles along in a homely way... but never generates anything truly remarkable.", "It is not profound or even particularly truthful, but I found it pretty fun to watch.", "An occasionally enjoyable, though uneven look, at the making of Psycho... Hitchcock is most engaging when Hopkins and Mirren share the screen as a durable old couple straining under 33 years of marriage.", "Hitchcock does noteworthy disservices to the master.", "Watching Hitchcock pitch his story to the press and bicker with executives and censors is amusing and sobering at the same time,", "Anyone wanting to learn about the real Hitchcock will be disappointed - although Hopkins does get a gold star for a tongue-in-cheek impersonation of Alfred.", "... Hitchcock blends fact, rumour, conjecture, fantasy, fiction, pop psychoanalysis and sheer screenwriting laziness into a gaudy, risible mishmash.", "If Hitchcock himself was alive today, he'd undoubtedly turn his nose up.", "The cod-psychologising is a little clunky but [Helen] Mirren's Mrs Hitch is inspiringly ballsy - with a dollop of the vulnerability that made you sob in The Queen."], "rating": ["8/10", "3.5/4", "", "3/5", "1.5/4", "2/5", "9/10", "", "", "", "3/5", "2/5", "", "", "", "", "2/5", "", "D+", "3/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Joanne Laurier", "Katie Smith-Wong", "Kelly Jane Torrance", "PJ Nabarro", "Debbie Baldwin", "Sarah Gopaul", "Deborah Ross", "Pat Padua", "Alexa Dalby", "Joseph Walsh", "Asia Frey", "Jordan Riefe", "A.S.
