{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Two college buddies reunite after a decade apart. Ben (Mark Duplass) is married and planning to start a family; Andrew (Joshua Leonard), a free spirit, has spent the last 10 years traveling the globe. Reigniting the rivalries of their college years, the friends agree to enter a movie in an upcoming amateur porn festival. Ben and Andrew's constant need to one-up each other results in a daring proposition: The staunchly heterosexual friends must star together in a gay adult film.", "rating": "79", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 34m", "director": "Lynn Shelton", "studio": "", "theater_date": "Jul 10, 2009", "dvd_date": "Nov 27, 2013", "box_office": "$388.4K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["At the end of the day, boys will boys and bros will be bros.
