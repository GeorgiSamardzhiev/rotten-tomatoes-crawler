{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Writer-director Paolo Sorrentino received the Cannes Jury Prize for his biopic of the fabled Italian politician Giulio Andreotti (Toni Servillo). The film covers a large portion of Andreotti's seven terms as prime minister of Italy, and concerns itself with the inner machinations of the man known as \"Beelzebub,\" the intrigue surrounding the disappearance of his political enemies (including two-time prime minister Aldo Moro), and the role of the Mafia in postwar Italy.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "1h 50m", "director": "Paolo Sorrentino", "studio": "IndigoFilms,LuckyRed,ArteFranceCinema,StudioCanal,ParcoFilm", "theater_date": "Apr 24, 2009", "dvd_date": "Feb 11, 2015", "box_office": "$239.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A more conventional filmmaker would be defeated by Andreotti's murky history, but Sorrentino's flamboyantly Baroque approach - full of dazzling visual flourishes worthy of Scorsese in his pomp - delivers an indelible portrait.", "Sumptuous filmmaking at its most flashiest, \"Il Divo\" may distance some people but I found it to be riveting.", "A clever telling of the story about the epic levels of corruption in Italian public life that found the suitably opaque, vampiric presence of Andreotti at the centre of it.", "A fascinating history of recent Italian politics.", "... not so much a savage satire as one disenchanted with the institutional corruption of politics.", "... Sorrentino avoids the dreary conventions of the biopic in favor of a cheeky mix of music montages, dramatic re-enactments and hilariously deadpan takes ....", "Combining clammy skin, busy hands, and a posture reminiscent of Snoopy in his vulture phase, [Servillo] (re-)creates a fascinating monster ... Given some CliffsNotes, the surrounding film might even be worthy of him.", "The film takes flight on the brilliant title performance by Tony Servillo (Gomorrah), who plays Andreotti like a mummified Alec Guinness, as if encased in layers of plaster of Paris.", "Inventive and fun... Toni Servillo gives a truly exquisite performance, easily the finest seen on U.S. screens in 2009 thus far.", "This is a spectacular film about corruption in high places, specifically as that relates to the political life of Giulio Andreotti, seven times prime minister of Italy and a senator for life.", "We may not know the man, but we know the dance, as seen in the highly diverting and hugely controversial Il Divo, a biopic as wly as its subject.", "A stunning piece of work that feels both familiar and completely unique at the same time.", "Servillo does such a good job of suggesting the drive and intelligence of the man that he automatically becomes one of the great recent cinematic symbols of absolute political power and the questionable means utilized in order to achieve it.", "After I saw Il Divo, I suppose I should have felt indignation. I suppose I should also have felt that way after \"The Godfather.\" But such films present such mesmerizing figures that I simply regard them, astonished.", "Even with no knowledge of Italian government, you can enjoy this hip, un-stodgy, grimly entertaining dissection of it.", "The enigmatic Andreotti is the perfect subject for a biopic in the European tradition.", "You may not leave the theater with a firmer grasp of Italian politics, but you will leave with an appreciation of some outstanding filmmaking.", "There is sufficient power in the imagery and performances to make Il Divo worth hacking through.", "All in all, this phenomenal film illustrates Alexis de Tocqueville's observation that \"The people get the government they deserve.\" In both meanings of the word, Il Divo is sensational.", "Il Divo joins Matteo Garrone's more expansive, more extraordinary Gomorrah -- which contains an even better performance from Servillo -- as a grim portrait of the trouble with modern Italy."], "rating": ["", "", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "7/10", "", "", "8/10", "4/5", "3.5/4", "", "", "3.5/4", "A", "4/5", "3.5/4", "B", "3.5/4", "3/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Jason Best", "Ard Vijn", "PJ Nabarro", "Wesley Lovell", "Sean Axmaker", "Sarah Boslaugh", "Andrew Wright", "Jonathan F.
