{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Ken Loach's acclaimed British drama focuses on Billy Casper (David Bradley), a tormented working-class boy who is subjected to abuse both at school and at home. The son of a single mother (Lynne Perrie), Billy's existence is mostly bleak until he takes up an interest in falconry and begins training a kestrel that he finds on a nearby farm. While Billy forms a close bond with the falcon, his hardscrabble life and harsh environment prove to be a challenge to the boy and his bird.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Art House & International/Classics/Drama", "runtime": "1h 49m", "director": "Ken Loach", "studio": "WoodfallFilmProductions,KestrelFilms", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Apr 28, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["There's a satisfaction to be found in the sereneness of the boy and his bird, contrasting with the harsh realities of growing pains.", "It is a genuine, resolute little film.", "... a lovely and touching film.", "One of the most powerful coming-of-age stories ever told, containing passages of great beauty.", "Kes, admirably photographed by Chris Menges (who was camera operator on Poor Cow) is not to be lightly dismissed; and Loach's success with young players especially makes one eager to see his forthcoming film for the Save the Children Fund.", "One of the nation's finest film-makers at an early peak.", "Ken Loach seems to acquire a surer mastery of his art with each picture, yet this, one of his earliest features, is still one of his best.", "Imagine The 400 Blows reconfigured around a working class English boy living in a grimy industrial town and you get some idea of the emotional power of this bleakly realistic film.", "Kes is one of the most astute, engaged films about education and what it takes for kids to be excited about learning or passionate about anything, really, whether in the classroom or roaming the fields with a feathered friend.", "The politics of the schoolyard are more important than the politics of London in Kes, and though he finds himself continuously ridiculed, Billy can always come back to his beloved kestrel.", "The only Loach film I rate more highly is his Spanish civil war picture, Land and Freedom.", "Seen today, it still cries its authentic song of rage. It still cuts like a knife.", "A film that captures Loach's ability to find the extraordinary drama in ordinary lives.", "Jaunty, sad, poetic, Kes is so humane it makes you tremble.", "Loach's beady eye catches it all, but it's the casting of Bradley that was his masterstroke.", "A rich film of flesh and blood.", "Funny, sad, bitingly authentic, Kes resonates with Loach's anger at the way many kids grow up into narrow, option-free lives.", "Loach and his cinematographer Chris Menges opt for a realistic, grainy, rough documentary look, which makes us in the audience feel as though we are voyeurs, bearing witness to what Godard had famously proclaimed cinema to be: truth 24 times a second.", "Throbs with a simple truthfulness...Loach shows his complimentary interest in documentary-influenced social realism and the improvisational search for the authentic. [Blu-ray]", "a moving, shattering tragedy - a meditation on the warping powers of human institutions. Kes is beautiful, sad and powerful - one of the best British films ever made."], "rating": ["7/10", "", "", "5/5", "", "5/5", "5/5", "4/5", "5/5", "4/4", "", "3/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "8", "4/4", "9"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Penelope Houston", "Sean Axmaker", "Jeffrey M.
