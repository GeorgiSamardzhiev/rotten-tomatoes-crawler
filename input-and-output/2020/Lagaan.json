{"metadata": {"synopsis": "The year is 1893 and India is under British occupation. In a small village, the tyrannical Captain Russell (Paul Blackthorne) has imposed an unprecedented land tax on its citizens. Outraged, Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), a rebellious farmer, rallies the villagers to publicly oppose the tax. Russell offers a novel way to settle the dispute: he challenges Bhuvan and his men to a game of cricket, a sport completely foreign to India. If Bhuvan and his men can defeat Russell's team, the tax will be repealed.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Art House & International/Comedy/Drama/Musical & Performing Arts", "runtime": "3h 43m", "director": "Ashutosh Gowariker", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Dec 9, 2017", "box_office": "$905.9K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["One of Hindi cinema's greatest underdog tales, a powerful script, impressive execution and an unforgettable soundtrack from A R Rahman...", "Will be the film all others in Bollywood are judged against, in terms of both creativity and success.", "An involving, easily digestible hunk of pure entertainment that could be the trigger for Bollywood's long-awaited crossover to non-ethnic markets.", "Few recent American musicals are this fluid or engaging.", "With an equally stunning soundtrack, this rollicking yarn is a must for all film lovers.", "The film's got a big scope and a big heart, even taking time to decry class, social, and racial discrimination.", "A great big Bollywood musical, complete with song and dance and doomed love triangles and elegantly photographed men playing cricket.
