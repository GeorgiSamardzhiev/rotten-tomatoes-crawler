{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When 28-year-old Megan (Keira Knightley) attends her 10-year high-school reunion, she realizes that very little in her life has changed. An unexpected marriage proposal from her boyfriend sparks a panic in Megan, causing her to wander off into the night. She meets 16-year-old Annika (Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz) who is with friends and proceeds to get drunk with the teens. Deciding she needs a break from her unfulfilling life, she tells her boyfriend she's going to a seminar but hangs with Annika.", "rating": "65", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "1h 40m", "director": "Lynn Shelton", "studio": "AnonymousContent,TheSolutionEntertainmentGroup", "theater_date": "Oct 24, 2014", "dvd_date": "Aug 15, 2016", "box_office": "$440.3K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Fits the mold of a teen angst film, except the main character Megan is a clever twenty-something who never completely grew out of her angst.", "A nicely polished example of familiarity, genuine with its intentions and generally pleasing.", "Whilst we don't go to the movies to make friends, it's hard to relate with these character's mundane existential predicaments from such a distant vantage.", "As I sat through [Lynn] Shelton's latest movie, Laggies, I couldn't help feeling deflated.", "Shelton has a knack for filming the literal and figurative spaces between people, and Andrea Seigel's contrived (albeit likeable) script is at home in Shelton's navel-gazing universe.", "LAGGIES operates in simple binaries that state being an adult is bad and being lost in a sea of teen angst is good.", "The size of this story fit perfectly into the space of the film. Keira Knightley created a sympathetic character in circumstances that were kind of suspect.", "It winds up indulging the very delusions that a good (not to mention realistic) script would puncture.", "It's possible that Shelton put a little too much faith in Knightley's charm, and you can't really blame her.", "Even if the film doesn't leave much to ponder past the closing credits, it's enjoyable while it's unfolding, doing justice to the strengths of Shelton's ever-expanding filmography.", "Laggies soon goes off the rails, its plot becoming more contrived and characters increasingly erratic.", "Plot implausibilities and Knightley's comedic deficiencies, however, ensure that proceedings never move much beyond the passable.", "Every filmmaker is allowed a few career missteps. Lynn Shelton seems to have spent all hers on just one movie.", "The limbo between adolescence and adulthood provokes a shrug", "While a bit hard to buy as an unmotivated screw-up, Knightley gives Megan an endearing bouncy quality, which jibes with the movie's pleasant tone and helps viewers believe Craig's feelings for Megan.", "A shrewd little dramedy directed by a woman, written by a woman and told from a woman's perspective, which on those merits alone constitutes a rare and special film worth seeing.", "Shallow, smug and bizarrely myopic ...", "Capturing that particular age group, of those in their late 20s and early 30s, entering into adulthood with a certain reluctance and trepidation.", "Shelton's comedy isn't just smart, but cheerfully wise; not just funny, but cleverly and endlessly so.", "This set-up is vaguely creepy and certainly problematic, but 'Laggies' works hard to be as reassuring and ultimately conventional as its snooze-inducing piano score."], "rating": ["3/5", "3/5", "2/5", "", "3.5/5", "C-", "", "", "", "B+", "C", "", "1.5/4", "", "3/4", "B", "7", "3/5", "", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Nicholas Bell", "Patrick Gamble", "Ren Jender", "Di Golding", "James Clay", "Asia Frey", "Megan Basham", "Josh Terry", "Emma Myers", "Jordan Raup", "Padraic McKiernan", "Robert W.
