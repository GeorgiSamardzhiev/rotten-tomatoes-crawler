As movie drama, it isn't so much overheated as reheated in the microwave on high.", "Its antiseptic textures merely whimper 'Oscar clip'", "Bereft of a protagonist, the movie breaks down under the weight of absurd voice-over narration and an exploitative ending that is as indefensibly wrongheaded as it is cheap.", "Blame Field (remember, Perrotta also wrote the knifelike Election), for facing the material too squarely.", "A risky and rewarding art film, but definitely for grown-ups.", "Little Children is about as close as a movie can get to literature %u2014 rich, nuanced, erudite and multi-layered.", "The leads are self-delusional, secretive, dependent, nakedly desperate at times, and all fascinating.", "The film is populated with such self-obsessed, distasteful characters, it's hard to care how or why any of them finds happiness.", "Provides a taut commentary on hypocrisy, human interaction, and the lies we tell ourselves...", "predstavlja upravo ono %u0161to bi \"ozbiljni\" holivudski film trebao biti", "Peyton Place with a perv!", "...a flawed work that sparkles only sporadically.", "The success Fields has with this film comes through the uncomfortable intersection between comedy, melodrama and tragedy.
