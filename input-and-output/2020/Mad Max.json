{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In a not-too-distant dystopian future, when man's most precious resource -- oil -- has been depleted and the world plunged into war, famine and financial chaos, the last vestiges of the law in Australia attempt to restrain a vicious biker gang. Max (Mel Gibson), an officer with the Main Force Patrol, launches a personal vendetta against the gang when his wife (Joanne Samuel) and son are hunted down and murdered, leaving him with nothing but the instincts for survival and retribution.", "rating": "90", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Cult Movies/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "George Miller", "studio": "KennedyMillerProductions,MadMaxFilms,Crossroads", "theater_date": "Jan 13, 1979", "dvd_date": "Aug 24, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["If you haven't seen writer-director George Miller's Mad Max in quite some time, then it's very likely you're not even remembering it right.", "The scene transitions and attention to continuity aren't the most scrutinized, but the editing and framing of action sequences never betray the age of the film.", "There's something about Mad Max...that's allowed it to stand the test of time, not only as a work of art in and of itself, but also as a name and brand that commands cultural currency thirty years since the character's last appearance.", "If punk is a sensibility as well as an adjective, Mad Max is a punk movie. Its Australian setting enhances it, authenticating its futuristic aura.", "It may not be my personal favourite genre, but what a showcase of creativity and grit.", "It's a tough little piece, just a little grimy, full of ambiance (love the crumbling sign over \"Hall of Justice\") and attitude and occasionally sparked by an inspired flourish.", "While it may not be as slick as Miller's other films featuring Gibson's iconic anti-hero, Mad Max still remains a timeless classic and one of the more remarkable films of its (or any) time.", "A solid and entertaining spectacle, filled with brilliantly staged action scenes and made all the more fascinating for its oracular indication of the age of bold movie science fiction that was to follow.", "An action masterpiece...", "No imitation can compete with the grindhouse jaggedness of Miller's original pursuit", "Its perhaps unjustified narrative shortcuts hardly seem to be much worth complaining about in the middle of its flawless action sequences.", "Manages not to waste a single frame of film even as it wastes countless motorcycles, trailers, automobiles and other vehicles across the bad roads of rural Australia.", "[The] film has been consigned to the grind houses, where audiences are responding as Miller wants them to. From there Mad Max will find its way to the film schools and revival houses, where its tough-gutted intelligence may be appreciated.", "Suffers from a case of terminal fatigue.", "[Max's] his weapon is a souped-up auto, which sets up chase scenes that make The Dukes of Hazzard seem like a hayride -- a feat director George Miller engineered with a meager $1 million budget. Dramatically, however, the film is inconsistent.", "Less pretentious and more gripping than the overrated sequel, The Road Warrior, but viciously violent and awfully shallow.", "Mad Max is a straight forward fusion of two B-movie genres popular in the 1970s: the car chase film and the vigilante revenge film.", "...essentially serves as the setup for the far superior Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior.", "While Mad Max has been hailed as a classic by some, it becomes plain to see that that reputation is not entirely deserved thanks to a bare-bones plot that doesn't even fill 90 minutes and a sluggish pace that will leave viewers struggling to stay awake.", "Beyond the explosive nature of the road movie, Mad Max also works as a character piece."], "rating": ["3.5/4", "7/10", "", "", "", "", "3.5/5", "3/4", "", "", "8/10", "4/4", "", "", "", "", "9/10", "1.5/4", "2.5/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Matt Brunson", "Mike Massie", "Zaki Hasan", "Bruce McCabe", "Keeva Stratton", "Sean Axmaker", "Heather Wixson", "David Keyes", "Felix Vasquez Jr.", "Fernando F.
