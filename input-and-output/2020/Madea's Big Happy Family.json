{"metadata": {"synopsis": "When Shirley (Loretta Devine), Madea's niece, receives distressing news about her health, the only thing she wants is her family gathered around her. However, Shirley's three adult children (Shad \"Bow Wow\" Moss, Shannon Kane, Natalie Desselle-Reid) are too preoccupied with their own troubled lives to pay attention to their mother. It is up to Madea (Tyler Perry), with the help of rowdy Aunt Bam (Cassi Davis), to bring the clan together and help Shirley deal with her crisis.", "rating": "38", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 46m", "director": "Tyler Perry", "studio": "TylerPerryCompany", "theater_date": "Apr 22, 2011", "dvd_date": "Dec 19, 2015", "box_office": "$53.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A return to Perry's early cinematic stylings.", "Is so obnoxious, annoying, unfunny, and downright hateful, that watching lunatics freaking out on stage during a paternity episode of Maury Povich would be better received.", "\"Madea's Big Happy Family\" is a facetious title; there's not a happy one in the bunch. Eventually, neither is the viewer.", "The odd thing about Tyler Perry is that just when you think he may be turning a corner and evolving, he goes into retrograde.", "Perry's performance of Madea [feels] flatter and more strained than he ever has in the role.", "Like most of Perry's movies, this one oscillates wildly and shamelessly between raunch and pathos, leaving plenty of room for the performers to work. The lively ensemble includes a scene-stealing Cassi Davis as pothead Aunt Bam.", "Deathbed scenes and colonoscopy humor, Bible quotations and Maury Povich \"Who Is the Real Baby Daddy\" episodes: All cohabit with equal relevance in the world of Tyler Perry.", "... Tyler Perry goes to the Madea well once too often and comes up dry.", "Comedy is comedy, and \"terminal illness\" is \"terminal illness\" and the two really shouldn't meet. What you end up with is a movie that's literally as funny as cancer.", "Madea's Big Happy Family is probably Perry's best film to date.", "I've been waiting patiently for Perry to make a Madea film that suits my tastes and I think this is the one.", "This \"Madea\" feels like the best \"Madea\" yet.", "A typical Perrython of Perryisms aimed at the most Perrynacious viewer. This means steaming melodrama, low comedy and a dash of Jesus.", "It's that time of year again, when the daffodils spring up and Tyler Perry puts on a dress and becomes Madea.", "One part funny and one part dramatic and sometimes these two parts clash instead of compliment.", "The problem with the last couple movies to feature Madea, in fact, has been that they haven't featured Madea enough.", "Epitomizing the shrill franchise's schizophrenic tonal shifts, Madea metes out Christian life lessons with one hand -- and righteously bitch-slaps with the other.", "The title is meant to be ironic. Too bad irony is in such short supply in Tyler Perry's Madea's Big Happy Family. Sadly, subtlety is also missing.", "If Perry gets on your wavelength, you can forgive him too. He's only the host at a home-cooked banquet of wild emotions.", "\"Madea's Big Happy Family'' nonsensically knots the spiritual and the salacious, asking gossipy questions then giving pulpit answers so that the movie is wonderfully, woefully absurd."], "rating": ["3.0/4", "D-", "1.5/4", "1.5/4", "4/10", "", "1.5/5", "1/5", "2/5", "3/5", "3.5/5", "2.5/4", "2.5/5", "2/4", "6/10", "C+", "1/5", "1/4", "", "2/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Propes", "Kiko Martinez", "Dustin Putman", "Michael Dequina", "Tim Brayton", "Michael Wilmington", "Marjorie Baumgarten", "Jim Lane", "Jim Slotek", "Grae Drake", "Dave White", "Chris Hewitt", "Ken Hanke", "Tom Meek", "Jackie K.
