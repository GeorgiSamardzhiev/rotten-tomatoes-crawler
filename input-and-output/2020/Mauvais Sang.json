He wants to express, in the purest way he can, his infatuation with storytelling through images and genre conventions, performance and voyeurism, cinema and cinephilia.", "A salute, at once moody and ebullient, to the cinema of the past and the ferocious intensity of youth.", "Once again we have the dancing tracking shot (to Bowie's 'Modern Love'), ventriloquism, fire breathing and a masterful, allegorical parachute jumping sequence.", "Its romantic moody style had a lyrical way about it that was affecting.", "", "", "In this, his second feature, [director Leos] Carax lives up to his billing as ''the natural heir of Jean-Luc Godard,'' showing a taste for underground types and milieus, an inventive eye and a tolerance for tedium.", "Another outstanding work by Carax."], "rating": ["", "", "5/5", "4/5", "3.5/4", "4/5", "", "A-", "B-", "4/5", "2/5", "", "3.5/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["\u00c1ngel Fern\u00e1ndez-Santos", "Richard Brody", "Ken Hanke", "Scott Tobias", "Kalvin Henely", "David Fear", "Melissa Anderson", "Laura Clifford", "Dennis Schwartz", "Emanuel Levy", "Greg Muskewitz", "Walter Goodman", "Jeffrey M.
