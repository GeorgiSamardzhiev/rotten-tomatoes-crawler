{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Track coach Jim White (Kevin Costner) is a newcomer to a predominantly Latino high-school in California's Central Valley. Coach White and his new students find that they have much to learn about one another, but things begin to change when White realizes the boys' exceptional running ability. More than just physical prowess drives the teens to succeed; their strong family ties, incredible work ethic and commitment to their team all play a factor in forging these novice runners into champions.", "rating": "80", "genre": "Drama/Kids & Family", "runtime": "2h 9m", "director": "Niki Caro", "studio": "MayhemPictures", "theater_date": "Feb 20, 2015", "dvd_date": "Jun 2, 2015", "box_office": "$44.5M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A standard issue inspiration coach movie.", "Its feel good and inspirational story will raise your spirits and leave you feeling much better when you leave the theater than when you entered it.", "There are good intentions behind this, even when it contains a problem or two [or three].", "It's exceptionally well-meaning and patently inoffensive. It's nice to feel good.", "The character development, the raw emotions, the pain (beyond the physical) is portrayed beautifully.", "Key to the truth of this storytelling lies beyond the performance, beyond the McFarland legacy and embraces the technical aspects and attention to detail of the film...A culturally immersive film, the visuals are evocative and telling.", "Sure, at the end of the day, it may be just another sports drama, replete with generic dramatic shifts and cutesy comic relief, but Caro manages to sail us through a tale that ends with an emotional, even inspirational triumph.", "Likely helped by its factual, period grounding the end result is an old-fashioned offering that's authentically rousing.", "A family film that will inspire everyone.", "It's like some sort of patriotic, eye-opening acid trip. These hard-working kids deserve to win, goddammit! You know what they really deserve? A movie of their own.", "Tells its by-the-bootstraps story so winningly that, predictable though it may be, it's still hard not to find it thoroughly rousing.", "Regardless of the sometimes flat emotional acting, the story still maintains its ability to pull on your heartstrings.", "The social reach of McFarland, USA is more than the story of a team of runners and a broken-down coach who show what they are made of. It's about community and becoming people of character, getting an education, and coming back to give back.", "Not a 'great' film per se, but definitely a worthwhile telling of a heartwarmingly Disney, sports-themed tale.", "McFarland still warms the cockles, Costner's flawed character proves watchable and everyone, particularly the younger actors gives solid performances.", "It could move a little faster and be a little less proud of its own progressiveness. But McFarland is a sports movie that knows what it's doing for the most part and ends strong.", "What makes McFarland USA so successful, and so bracing, is the way that its protagonist becomes aware of something that is rarely broached in these sorts of narratives - his own privilege.", "Like the best sports movies, McFarland, USA makes sure the action on the field is only one part of the cinematic spectrum. And in this case, it's a spectrum worth seeing.", "There are no great surprises here but the cultural backdrop - almost everyone in the town is Mexican - adds interest and Costner is at his most relaxed and appealing.", "Niki Caro uses every device at her disposal to make a rousing, feelgood movie but risks turning the film into a glorified fairytale in the process."], "rating": ["2.5/5", "3.0/4", "B-", "", "", "", "2.5/5", "4/5", "A", "5.5", "B+", "", "", "B", "3/5", "3/5", "", "", "3/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Richard Crouse", "Richard Propes", "Allen Almachar", "Dan Scully", "Christie Cronan", "Debbie Lynn Elias", "Nicholas Bell", "Stephen O&#39;Nion", "Rachel Wagner", "Bernard Boo", "Zaki Hasan", "Pamela Powell", "Sr. Rose Pacatte", "Jared Mobarak", "Alex Zane", "Norman Wilner", "Brandon Ambrosino", "Josh Terry", "Henry Fitzherbert", "Geoffrey Macnab"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Richard Crouse", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The MacGuffin", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema76", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Raising Whasians", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Behind The Lens", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">IONCINEMA.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">One Room With A View", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">rachelsreviews.net", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Way Too Indie", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Zaki&#39;s Corner", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Journal (Kankakee, IL)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">National Catholic Reporter", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Stage", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Sun (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">NOW Toronto", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Vox", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Deseret News (Salt Lake City)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Express (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)"], "date": ["February 2, 2021", "September 16, 2020", "July 16, 2020", "April 10, 2020", "February 5, 2020", "December 8, 2019", "September 19, 2019", "May 4, 2019", "April 30, 2019", "March 15, 2019", "November 16, 2018", "August 21, 2018", "August 10, 2017", "February 23, 2016", "January 2, 2016", "December 18, 2015", "December 17, 2015", "November 5, 2015", "September 28, 2015", "September 25, 2015"]}}
