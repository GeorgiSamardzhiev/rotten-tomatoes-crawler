{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Hendrik Hoefgen (Klaus Maria Brandauer) craves center stage. After years spent slogging it out in provincial theaters, he's grown sufficiently desperate that when the Nazi party effectively offers to make him a star, he doesn't hesitate. Great roles and plenty of praise accumulate quickly, and Hendrik revels in his success. He dreams of ultimately playing Mephisto, and to that end blithely overlooks the profound moral compromises of his situation.", "rating": "78", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "2h 15m", "director": "Istv\u00e1n Szab\u00f3", "studio": "", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jul 19, 2020", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Brandauer ... embodies the tortured artist through a wildly vivid range that careens from hammy, operatic full-body gestures to the most subtle changes of expression at eyeball-level.", "While the film runs slightly overlong, it never gets tiresome, thanks to Brandauer's haunting performance.", "a haunting study in ambition, opportunism, and compromise", "The issue is that the story appears like a simple sketch, which never explores the main subject with depth.

What masks are \"Mephisto's\" audiences wearing today?", "A compelling melodrama, essentially a revisiting of Goethe's version of the Faust legend, revised for the pre-war Nazi rise to power period.", "Few have dared what Brandauer accomplishes: showing us a good actor responding to the same neurotic drive for the center of the stage, the immortalizing role. His is a great performance, nothing less.", "A disappointingly thin, conventional film.", "An inspired update of the Faust legend featuring a tour de force performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer.", "Hungaro pic shows extraordinary period flair for the Germany of the 1920s and '30s, balanced acting by a multinational cast, and exemplary direction.", "Difficult subject, but well pulled off.
