{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Brian Cohen (Graham Chapman) is an average young Jewish man, but through a series of ridiculous events, he gains a reputation as the Messiah. When he's not dodging his followers or being scolded by his shrill mother (Terry Jones), the hapless Brian has to contend with the pompous Pontius Pilate (Michael Palin) and acronym-obsessed members of a separatist movement. Rife with Monty Python's signature absurdity, the tale finds Brian's life paralleling Biblical lore, albeit with many more laughs.", "rating": "95", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Terry Jones", "studio": "Paramount", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Mar 25, 2017", "box_office": "$150.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["The plot treads a narrow, semi-blasphemous path through ancient times.", "While the movie doesn't reinvent the wheel, it is professionally impeccable.

A contender.", "The Pythons' instincts strike home, not only in Brian's miserable failure to imbue his followers with some basic decency, but in the self-apparent barbarism that he's fighting against.", "Brian's life is pure hell. And very funny to watch.", "Only a select few of [Monty Python's] truest fans will appreciate the message they convey in a movie that actively mocks the concept of organized religion while making us laugh along with them.", "It looked back 2000 years for its comic content, but was a decade ahead in provoking Christian controversy. Yet how much hotter would the steaming Pilate of blasphemy-accusations have got if the Pythons had included their scripted mockeries of Zionism?", "Sandaled Python pic too irreverent for young kids.", "It's a Mel Brooks kind of Jewish joke film made by gentiles.", "I've always considered it the group's nadir; it seems toothlessly silly.", "Brian contains too many hilarious bits to single out the best.", "Just as wacky and imaginative as their earlier film outings.", "Boys of my generation memorize the Monty Python repertoire as a buttress against the terror of losing their virginity.", "A cheeky, irreverent parallel to the life of Jesus by the last great comedy troupe to make movies.", "Python successfully lampoon religious attitudes rather than religion itself.", "Although some consider Monty Python an acquired taste, anyone with a sense of humor and an open mind should find something in this movie to enjoy."], "rating": ["3.5/5", "", "5/5", "", "5/5", "3/5", "1", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "B", "", "4/4", "", "3/4", "3/4", "", "4/4"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Leigh Paatsch", "Diego Gal\u00e1n", "C.H.
