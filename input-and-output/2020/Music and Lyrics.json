{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Former music superstar Alex Fletcher (Hugh Grant) used to pack them in back in the 1980s, but now he is reduced to playing nostalgia tours and county fairs. He scores a chance at a major comeback when reigning pop diva Cora Corman (Haley Bennett) asks him to write a song for her, but he hasn't written anything in years and cannot compose lyrics anyway. Noticing that Sophie (Drew Barrymore), the plant lady, has a way with words, Alex proposes that he and Sophie make beautiful music together.", "rating": "63", "genre": "Comedy/Romance", "runtime": "1h 36m", "director": "Marc Lawrence", "studio": "CastleRockEntertainment,VillageRoadshowPictures,FlowerFilms", "theater_date": "Feb 14, 2007", "dvd_date": "Jun 1, 2009", "box_office": "$50.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Hugh Grant and Drew Barrymore are another match made in silver screen heaven.", "Lawrence has a distinct lack of ability to write anything remotely resembling a real human. Maybe romantic comedies don't really need that sort of thing but if there's nothing else going for it - and there's nothing else going for it - it would help.", "", "Sweet, predictable date movie. Teens OK.", "Move beyond the lame title, and you'll find an unexpectedly good movie, with the inspired casting of Drew Berry and Hugh Grant possessing the necessary chemistry to lift this rote, manufactured story into something appealing.", "", "Far too little originality ... to make the film anything other than a disposable rom-com triviality.", "Music and Lyrics could have had more rhythm and a better beat...", "Hugh Grant is a genius at romantic comedy. He has just the right blend of good looks, sex appeal, wit, sensitivity, self-awareness, and even more endearing, self-mockery.", "\"Music and Lyrics\" argues that pop songs are poetry, and in the tradition of Walt Whitman, the film proceeds to celebrate itself.", "Una comedia rom\u00e1ntica realmente menor y predecible, con alguna iron\u00eda sobre la m\u00fasica pop de los a\u00f1os '80 (y la de ahora).", "... this is a movie that will lose nothing when you rent it from Netflix a few months from now.", "Good-natured, melodic and sweet as can be, \"Music and Lyrics\" is like listening to your favorite '80s compilation: It just plain makes you feel good.", "Embora nada original, o roteiro \u00e9 suficientemente divertido e explora muito bem as mais do que estabelecidas personas da dupla principal: o jeit\u00e3o desajeitado e auto-cr\u00edtico de Grant e a inseguran\u00e7a engra\u00e7adinha de Barrymore.", "Music and Lyrics is a nice, light, bright romantic comedy -- a demonstration of the best and the worst of modern romantic comedy in action, in fact. ...", "Despite a copout ending that dumbs down the film's previous wit-filled 90 minutes, few mainstream audiences will be able to resist its charms.", "This movie has more witty lines in any 10 minute clip than most comedies have in the entire film.", "Music and Lyrics is not the most original or ambitious movie I've ever seen. However, Barrymore is well-paired with Grant in a story that is smarter than you might think. It's just all-around good fun.", "Like a catchy pop song you can't stop humming, the sublime romantic melody of Music and Lyrics puts a smile on your face and love in your heart.", "This is Barrymore's burden, that she consistently resists generic business even as she makes it tolerable.
