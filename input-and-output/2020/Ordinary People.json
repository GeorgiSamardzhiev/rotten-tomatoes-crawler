Returning home following an extended stay in a psychiatric hospital, Conrad tries to deal with his mental anguish and also reconnect with his mother, Beth (Mary Tyler Moore), who has grown cold and angry, and his emotionally wounded father, Calvin (Donald Sutherland), with the help of his psychiatrist, Dr. Berger (Judd Hirsch).", "rating": "89", "genre": "Drama", "runtime": "2h 3m", "director": "Robert Redford", "studio": "ParamountPictures,WildwoodEnterprises", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["With no action, few characters, and little suspense, the film relies heavily on its acting - and what an impressive aspect it is.", "Despite technical flaws and awkward story-telling, Ordinary People has tremendous emotional power.", "Robert Redford brings stirring emotion and impressive skill to this story of an affluent family crumbling under the facade of normalcy.", "Adapted brilliantly and faithfully from the surprise best-selling novel by Judith Guest.", "Ordinary People, consequently, has a closeness but not much expressiveness of texture.", "Ordinary People (baroque music and all) will probably move a lot of people in the same way as Kramer vs. Kramer did, concerned as it is with people we all know, or might well be.", "The director's contribution is reticent and unobtrusive; his aim, not surprising perhaps in an actor, had been to give she stage wholly to the text and the performances; and both are, certainly, exemplary.", "The quality of the film is not spectacular enough to obviate the fact that this is another story of the pain and torment that even money can't buy you out of.", "The confident and effective ensemble make up a family portrait, where tragedy has arrived to shatter the peace and tranquility of their lives in Chicago.
