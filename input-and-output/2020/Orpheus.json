{"metadata": {"synopsis": "At the Caf\u00e9 des Po\u00e8tes in Paris, a fight breaks out between the poet Orph\u00e9e (Jean Marais) and a group of resentful upstarts. A rival poet, C\u00e8geste (Edouard Dermithe), is killed, and a mysterious princess (Mar\u00eda Casares) insists on taking Orpheus and the body away in her Rolls-Royce. Orph\u00e9e soon finds himself in the underworld, where the Princess announces that she is, in fact, Death. Orpheus escapes in the car back to the land of the living, only to become obsessed with the car radio.", "rating": "97", "genre": "Art House & International/Science Fiction & Fantasy", "runtime": "1h 35m", "director": "Jean Cocteau", "studio": "AndrePaulveFilm", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Oct 15, 2020", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Orpheus is a film of mirrors and windows. For Cocteau the answer to the question of whether the cinema is a window through which we observe others or a mirror in which we observe ourselves is that it is both and neither...", "Cocteau saw film as a kind of poetry on celluloid, and never is that more clear than in Orpheus, which is the director's ultimate statement of his own artistic philosophies.", "It's a familiar tale but one which feels fresh and fascinating.", "It has the mystery and elasticity of a dream, and all the farcical comic horror of chancing across the intricate contents of the Blessed Virgin's lingerie collection.", "A poet, novelist, painter, sculptor and opium addict, Cocteau only had time to make a handful of films. Watch Orphe and ponder what might have been.", "A magical enduring classic, to be seen again and again.", "Pretentious? Certainly, but full of the joy of filmmaking and there is a fairly coherent light through all the madness. It may illuminate man's obsessions and idol worship in a cautionary way, but Cocteau is also embracing those very ideas with his film.", "a paragon of magical realism that transports the ancient Greek myth into the then-modern realm of postwar France", "If you're the kind of amateur existentialist who admires the ring of a sentence like \"look a lifetime in a mirror and you will see Death at work\", then this beautiful film is for you.", "Jean Cocteau's scripting and directing give the film its proper key of unworldliness.", "Comes as close as cinema can to poetry.", "Cocteau's visual imagination, leading us through mirrors into a bomb-scarred dreamworld governed by the femme fatale of Death, is enduringly magical and strongly cinematic.", "Somnambulistic symbolism may be art for art's sake. Maybe not. This writer finds it slightly tiresome.", "Its tight cross-lacing of paranoid dreaming and poetic realism grips like a bondage corset.", "", "", "Jean Cocteau's updating of the Orpheus myth to post-Liberation Paris is one of cinema's great artistic masterpieces, a piece of Mlis-like magic that is intensely powerful and moving even at its most bewildering.", "Full of haunting imagery plucked from the realm of fairy tales, Orphe is one of the great cinematic fantasies of the 20th century.", "", "Notable for its vivid and inventive imagery, bringing the Greek myth of Orpheus to the present day with style and passion that's both poetic and realistically gritty"], "rating": ["", "4/4", "", "5/5", "", "", "3.5/4", "4/4", "", "", "A", "5/5", "", "", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "5/5", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["A.S.
