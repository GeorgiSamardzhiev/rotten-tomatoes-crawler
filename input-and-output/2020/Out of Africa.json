{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Initially set on being a dairy farmer, the aristocratic Karen Blixen (Meryl Streep) travels to Africa to join her husband, Bror (Klaus Maria Brandauer), who instead spends their money on a coffee plantation. After discovering Bror is unfaithful, Karen develops feelings for hunter Denys (Robert Redford), but realizes he prefers a simplistic lifestyle compared to her upper class background. The two continue on until a series of events force Karen to choose between her love and personal growth.", "rating": "62", "genre": "Drama/Romance", "runtime": "2h 40m", "director": "Sydney Pollack", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "Dec 18, 1985", "dvd_date": "Apr 19, 2016", "box_office": "$83.1M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Out of Africa is simply superb.", "Sydney Pollack's glorious and stirring Out of Africa is a big-screen epic in the very best sense.", "Though it has many engaging moments (mostly in its first 40 minutes, out of 150), producer/director Sydney Pollack's attempt to dramatize Isak Dinesen's years as a pioneer farmer in Kenya ultimately fails as drama and as romance.", "Pollack deserves a good part of the praise for this superb project. From seeing the potential in Dinesen's story in the first place, to bringing it to the screen in such a rich, balanced and engaging way, he deserves thanks along with the accolades.", "Beautiful in an illustrative and rhapsodic, rather than dramatic, way, this large-scale adaptation of Isak Dinesen's famous 1937 memoir never works up much steam.", "The movie could probably be shorter, but I didn't wish it so.", "Like many a classic screen epic, Out of Africa is long, romantic, beautiful, and slightly boring.", "The film makers' greatest failing is that they have taken inherently interesting characters and given us a film that is a crashing bore.", "There comes a time in movie addicts' lives when their souls cry out for the kind of film that can fill the screen with magnificent vistas, grand passions and charismatic actors. That's why the arrival of Out of Africa is cause for cheering.", "Director Sydney Pollack has filmed some lovely and exciting animal/survival footage, and writer Kurt Luedtke has given Streep and Redford the most literate of dialogue to read.", "Surprise! A movie I thought I'd hate has turned out to be one of the smartest, most enjoyable big-screen romances in years.", "Out of Africa is a stunner, a freak, a rarity, a miracle. It's a genuine movie for grown-ups that's moving, sweet and deeply romantic.", "The most-remembered moments of Out of Africa are the travelogue sequences, which is not what the book or the author are all about.", "In sum, Out of Africa is great film making in the best tradition of Hollywood romance. It's a stunning and immensely satisfying 150 minutes in a theater.", "A movie of a scale and tone uncommon to Hollywood films.", "The movie is a beauty to look at and has been staged and assembled with loving care by its director, Sydney Pollack, who has yet to make an unattractive film. And yet Our of Africa just lays there, a victim of its own toney pretension and bloated length.", "The genuine worth of Out of Africa will rest on whether it inspires viewers to seek out the books of Isak Dinesen. The film's fidelity to these haunting and intensely personal writings is at once its great strength -- and its weakness.", "The book and its characters are simply not translatable to the screen, and what we get is a sufferable alternative.", "A mushy, unduly protracted cross between a glossy Fitzpatrick Traveltalk on 'Kenya, Land of Contrasts' and one of those pre-war Hollywood colonial melodramas in the Maugham manner (some of them actually by Maugham).", "It is a brilliant film, rich with verdant landscapes and the aura of grandeur."], "rating": ["", "4/4", "2/4", "", "", "", "", "2/4", "", "", "", "", "", "5/5", "3/4", "", "2.5/4", "", "", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Marylynn Uricchio", "Rick Lyman", "Michael Sragow", "Rick Chatenever", "David Denby", "Paul Byrnes", "Steve Warren", "Robert Trussell", "Bob Thomas", "Joe Baltake", "F.X.
