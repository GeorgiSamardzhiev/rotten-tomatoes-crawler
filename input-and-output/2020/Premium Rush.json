{"metadata": {"synopsis": "For bike messenger Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), dodging speeding cars, evading crazy cabdrivers, and blowing by millions of cranky pedestrians is all in a day's work. Wilee is one of the best in a dangerous job, and his bike of choice is a Fixie, a lightweight, single-gear unit without brakes. Though Wilee knows that one day he may end up as a smear on the pavement -- he is unprepared for what happens after his last run of the day turns into a life-or-death chase through Manhattan.", "rating": "74", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "1h 31m", "director": "David Koepp", "studio": "PariahFilms", "theater_date": "Aug 24, 2011", "dvd_date": "May 7, 2013", "box_office": "$20.3M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Employs stylized forms of special effects and editing - essentially interference that reminds audiences that they're watching a movie instead of becoming immersed in it.", "A better film because Joseph Gordon-Levitt is in it.", "A slick, entertaining ride, full of great stunt work, and if that's what you're looking for, you won't be disappointed.", "This is no fancy carbon 12-speed. It's hard core: lightweight steel frame, no gears, no brakes.", "The story is skimpy... but delivers.", "[Joseph Gordon-Levitt is] a talented guy, but I cannot tell you to run right out and see this one. It's a 5.", "It looks like screenwriter David Keopp's (Jurassic Park, Mission: Impossible) writing takes a hit when he's also taking on the role of director.", "The pace of the movie is really fantastic, but once you get past that and realize you've been watching a 90-minute bike chase, which isn't nearly as thrilling as the trailer lets on, you begin to deflate.", "It's weightless and graceless, complete with a stock love story, a cloying human interest angle, and no shortage of poor acting.", "It's a tight little thriller, briskly told. And I'm already having a hard time remembering anything else about It.", "Satisfying on a basic, fun level, but also stylishly produced and not insulting to the viewer's intelligence.", "The movie, idiotic as it is, has its charms, thanks in large part to its two main actors.", "Gordon-Levitt proves he's the best actor on two wheels, pedaling furiously to save a grueling ride from becoming more tiresome.", "Joseph Gordon-Levitt' fixed-wheel bike has a single gear and no brakes, and you could say the same of director David Koepp's film, which is light on character and plot. But, even on two wheels, the action is fast and furious.", "Want more from a late-summer joyride than slides, wheelies and bunny hops? Get a load of Shannon, dementedly inspired, trying out an oddball accent and Richard Widmark giggle.", "Gordon-Levitt is, as usual, a likeable hero, though he's underused in a film that's plainly more interested in kinetics than drama.", "Just a few spokes short of a wheel, guys.", "An unpretentious throwback to the kind of action movie that had no need of superheroes, Premium Rush is hardly a classic but fun up to a point.", "A fun chase film starring the likable Joseph Gordon-Levitt, with a deliciously over-the-top performance by Michael Shannon as a villainous crooked cop, and some X Games-worthy bike stunts.", "Premium Rush is that rare bird: a chase picture that's just a chase picture - and a dandy one."], "rating": ["6/10", "2.5/4", "B-", "", "", "5/10", "2/4", "D+", "2/5", "", "B+", "B-", "C", "", "3/5", "", "3/5", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Richard Propes", "Brent McKnight", "Brian D.
