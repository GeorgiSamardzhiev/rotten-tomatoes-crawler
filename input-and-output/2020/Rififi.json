Expanding a minor smash-and-grab into a full-scale jewel heist, Tony and his crew appear to get away clean, but their actions after the job is completed threaten the lives of everyone involved.", "rating": "92", "genre": "Art House & International/Drama", "runtime": "2h", "director": "Jules Dassin", "studio": "PrimaFilm,Indusfilms,Soci\u00e9t\u00e9NouvelleProdis", "theater_date": "Jun 5, 1956", "dvd_date": "Apr 24, 2001", "box_office": "$57.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["\"Dassin's first French film is a stylistic and thematic distillation of his best Hollywood work\".

This pic has something intrinsically Gallic without sacrificing the rugged storytelling.", "The film turns moralistic and sour in the last half, when the thieves fall out.", "A familiar but effective parable of honor among thieves.", "Jules Dassin's classic jewel-thief caper of 1955 looks as smart as paint, with its unendurably tense, entirely wordless robbery section.", "The grandfather of all heists movies.
