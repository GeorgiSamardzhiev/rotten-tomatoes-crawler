{"metadata": {"synopsis": "It sounds like just another urban legend -- a videotape filled with nightmarish images leads to a phone call foretelling the viewer's death in exactly seven days. Newspaper reporter Rachel Keller (Naomi Watts) is skeptical of the story until four teenagers all die mysteriously exactly one week after watching just such a tape. Allowing her investigative curiosity to get the better of her, Rachel tracks down the video and watches it. Now she has just seven days to unravel the mystery.", "rating": "71", "genre": "Drama/Horror/Mystery & Suspense/Romance", "runtime": "1h 55m", "director": "Gore Verbinski", "studio": "DreamWorksSKG", "theater_date": "Oct 18, 2002", "dvd_date": "Oct 4, 2016", "box_office": "$128.6M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["A horrifically terrifying film-going experience - to be sure. A horrifically terrifying film? No way.", "A thoroughly prosaic and prototypical spooker that commits the cardinal sin of devaluing what made the raw materials of its fable so original and powerful in the first place.", "This remake of a hugely successful Japanese horror film is very well acted by Naomi Watts. It's just not that scary.", "A very strong movie in all the ways you need a horror movie to be strong. But it is a movie that could very obviously be better.", "Gore Verbinski creates an air of dread that begins with the first scene and never lets up, subtly incorporating elements from the current wave of Japanese horror films along the way.", "One of the most intelligent and genuinely scary ghost stories to come around in a long time.", "The filmmakers have wisely stayed close to the original's mood, which is somber and flat, with quick (near-subliminal) inserts and a soundtrack full of watery-grave groans and murmurs.", "The Ring doesn't have the wiliness or conviction to exploit either a single mother's guilt over child neglect or our collective queasiness over potential bad seeds. It merely alternates these themes and toys with them.", "An edgy, watchable film, but one that makes you feel more squeamish than screamish.", "The Ring, about a videotape that kills people, is so full of inconsistencies and plot holes that I stumbled from a recent screening with few answers, and a ton of questions.", "The Ring, an elegantly creepy film set in a perpetual Seattle rainstorm, is interested more in eerie, unnerving thrills than bloodletting.", "Watching The Ring won't kill you, but it could bore you half to death.", "The slow pace gives us too much time to think about the story's lapses in logic. And Verbinski's style is so conventional that the various scare devices and horror images he throws on the screen feel oddly more comforting than frightening.", "I hated it, but I grant that it does tap into a vein of technological horror -- the fear of the VCR! -- that will have young videophiles chatting it up for weeks.", "Though more expensive and less atmospheric than the Japanese picture, the film isn't at all bad.", "A chilling idea, finely executed, in a rare remake success. See it if you dare -- but we wouldn't recommend you go alone.", "Verbinski makes a couple of inventive additions, and although the spine-chilling terror of the superior 1997 original is muted by the overuse of CGI, this is still a worthy substitute if you're not in the mood for subtitles.", "The Ring is easily the most terrifying movie to come out of Hollywood in years.", "Light years ahead of the half-cocked horror coming out of Hollywood, the mounting dread provides the requisite amount of chair-jolting shocks.", "Oh boy, this one is creepy. Creepy like a single, leaden knock on your front door when you're home all alone and it's 2:30 in the morning and it's October, and you're not expecting anyone and then the doorknob turns.
