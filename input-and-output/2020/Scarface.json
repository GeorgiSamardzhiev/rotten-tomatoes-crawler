{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After getting a green card in exchange for assassinating a Cuban government official, Tony Montana (Al Pacino) stakes a claim on the drug trade in Miami. Viciously murdering anyone who stands in his way, Tony eventually becomes the biggest drug lord in the state, controlling nearly all the cocaine that comes through Miami. But increased pressure from the police, wars with Colombian drug cartels and his own drug-fueled paranoia serve to fuel the flames of his eventual downfall.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Drama/Mystery & Suspense", "runtime": "2h 50m", "director": "Brian De Palma", "studio": "UniversalPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jun 15, 2012", "box_office": "$656.2K"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It will primarily be remembered as a machine-gun-soaked actioner of tough talk, cinematic betrayals and retribution, and mountains of cocaine.", "Day-Glo Miami is framed well by John A. Alonzo, and the pulsating music by Giorgio Moroder is worthy of a listen on its own.", "Pacino is a brilliant actor and his portrayal of a Cuban immigrant in Scarface is a perfect example of his work.", "Other than an unflinching, intense and extraordinary performance from Al Pacino as the Cuban-born gangster Tony Montana, this gruesome offering has little to recommend.", "De Palma directs it as a blood-drenched thug opera, a mix of the graceful and the garish with Pacino's guttural thug-in-a-suit spitting out dialogue like broken glass in a harsh Cuban accent.", "Stone sticks all too closely to the dated plot structure of the original movie, and such melodramatic flourishes as Montana's incestuous attraction for his sister now seem completely ludicrous.", "It is a serious, often hilarious peek under the rock where nightmares strut in $800 suits and Armageddon lies around the next twist of treason.", "The sharp, if expletive-ridden, dialogue in Oliver Stone's script and the vivid cinematography of John A Alonzo help make De Palma's urban shocker a modern-day classic.", "Characterization and plot go out the window. Arms are cut off with chain saws. By the third hour everything is out of control.", "[Brian DePalma] apparently considers ''money isn't everything'' an original and profound message.", "One fundamentally dishonest character choice launched a billion-dollar industry. But it hardly sours a film that became a garishly ghoulish, bleakly funny and compulsively watchable template for modern-criminal deconstructions of the American Dream.", "By ignoring its massive, toxic, nuclear-fallout shortcomings, it finds its way to the hallowed status of camp classic.", "one of Brian DePalma's best films", "Performances are all extremely effective, with Pacino leading the way.", "...much, much longer than it generally needs to be...", "One of the best gangster dramas ever made, driven by Pacino's haunting performance and De Palma's lightning pace.", "It's a whole new spin on the immigrant story and the American Dream as an underworld nightmare and a fitting bookend to the two Godfather films.", "the very definition of excess, which is perhaps why it has persisted so long as a cultural totem: Its florid pleasures can never be exhausted", "Paciono gives a riveting performance in the lead in De Palma's over-the-top but engaging modern version of the classic gangster", "Extremely violent '80s crime classic with drugs, sex, etc."], "rating": ["6/10", "3/4", "4.5/5", "", "", "2/4", "", "4/5", "", "", "4/5", "F", "3.5/5", "", "3/4", "9/10", "", "3.5/4", "B+", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Tom Meek", "Allison Rose", "Duane Byrge", "Sean Axmaker", "Kathleen Carroll", "Richard Corliss", "Alan Jones", "", "David Sterritt", "Nick Rogers", "Rob Vaux", "Kevin Carr", "Variety Staff", "David Nusair", "R.L.
