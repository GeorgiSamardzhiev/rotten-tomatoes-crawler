{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Jake (Kevin Bacon) and Kristy Briggs (Elizabeth McGovern) have made the leap from high school sweethearts to newlyweds, but married life is not what Jake expected. While he fantasizes about a dream girl and envies the lifestyle of his single best friend (Alec Baldwin), Kristy is ready to have a baby. Instead of sharing this with Jake, she opts to secretly stop taking birth control. However, Kristy comes clean after failing to become pregnant, prompting Jake to go to a fertility clinic.", "rating": "40", "genre": "Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 45m", "director": "John Hughes", "studio": "HughesEntertainment,ParamountPictures", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Aug 3, 2016", "box_office": "$14.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Hughes has supplied some bright, even brilliant touches in dealing with the traditional cliches.", "[Hughes] proves he also can handle life on the other side of graduation.", "If She's Having a Baby were a funnier movie, if the fights were more cleverly written and Bacon and McGovern played them more deftly and lightly, it wouldn't have that unpleasant edge -- seesawing between romance and paranoia.", "By turns amusing and exasperating, it takes its time getting to the \"Life is what you make it\" point, but it's sweet.", "[The film] assumes that boys will be boys but that the mystical act of fatherhood will make a man of you. Trouble with She's Having a Baby is, Hughes believes this without feeling obliged to develop it dramatically.", "Director Hughes' effort to follow his teenagers into adulthood only results in cardboard cut-outs.", "It's a measure of how little maneuvering room the movie leaves its performers that a lovely, sensitive actress like Elizabeth McGovern makes virtually no impression.", "She's Having a Baby wants to be everyone's story, but its hollowness makes it no one's.", "McGovern manages to fare better with the cliches thrown at her than Bacon does; but neither has a prayer of scoring at a game whose rules and players might have been dreamed up by a computer.", "Bacon`s character is such a chronic complainer than we wonder why McGovern doesn't dump him.", "As for Bacon and McGovern, it`s sad to see these usually energetic performers labor through a tired script, rarely getting a chance to deliver.", "Hughes instead falls back on the easy jokes, hip music, and superficial character studies that have obscured the basic viability of all his work.", "Hughes is simply doing what they tell you the first day of creative writing class: write about what you know. And he's doing it with both craft and a good deal of emotional honesty.", "Like the couple he chronicles, Hughes seems to be profiting from the maturation process.", "Director John Hughes tries his best to give everything a sparky, pacey feel, but the end result is simply just not funny enough.", "So very little works in She's Having a Baby that it's easiest just to grouse on how petty and little-minded and pro-conformity it is.", "In the lead role, Kevin Bacon is enthusiastic and believable, but even his energy can't carry what boils down to a fairly limp story.", "", "A rare failure from filmmaker John Hughes...", "Taking his erstwhile teen lovers into young adulthood, marriage and parenthood, John Hughes fashions a curiously disaffected portrait of the artist as a frustrated chauvinist."], "rating": ["3/4", "", "", "3/5", "2/4", "", "", "2/4", "", "1/4", "", "2/4", "", "", "2/5", "4/10", "", "3/5", "2/4", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten"], "critic": ["Bob Thomas", "Cathy Burke", "Michael Wilmington", "William Thomas", "Carrie Rickey", "Film4 Staff", "Jay Boyar", "Dave Kehr", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Gene Siskel", "Juan Carlos Coto", "", "Ben Yagoda", "People Staff", "Sue Heal", "Tim Brayton", "Variety Staff", "Neil Cohen", "David Nusair", "Tom Charity"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Associated Press", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">United Press International", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Los Angeles Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Inquirer", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Orlando Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Tribune", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">South Florida Sun-Sentinel", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Philadelphia Daily News", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">People Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Antagony &amp; Ecstasy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Echo Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out"], "date": ["April 3, 2019", "December 9, 2017", "June 4, 2014", "June 4, 2014", "June 4, 2014", "June 4, 2014", "June 4, 2014", "June 4, 2014", "June 4, 2014", "June 4, 2014", "June 4, 2014", "June 4, 2014", "June 4, 2014", "June 4, 2014", "June 4, 2014", "November 2, 2011", "March 26, 2009", "July 29, 2007", "July 11, 2006", "February 9, 2006"]}}
