{"metadata": {"synopsis": "In this quartet of neo-noir tales, a mysterious salesman (Josh Hartnett) narrates a tragic story of co-dependency, while a musclebound vigilante (Mickey Rourke) tears his way through the criminal underworld in search of his lost love (Jaime King).

Too bad the narration sounds like a string of clich\u00e9s from creaky old detective novels.", "With a huge, well-chosen cast and the blessing of Miller, who was on set as Rodriguez's co-director, Sin City is a gloriously stylized world unlike anything you've seen before on screen.", "For all its astronomical body count, Sin City is brazenly, thrillingly alive.", "While Sin City on screen evokes the same feeling of bottomless decadence and dread that the novels do, there is one crucial difference -- you can put the novels down.", "Sin City is a lot of things, but most of all, it's fun. It may not be for everyone, but everyone should see it once anyway, just to find out if it's for them.", "This extremely violent movie is NOT for kids.", "On one hand, Robert Rodriguez drenches \"Sin City\" in his usual monsoon of ironic, macho macabre.
