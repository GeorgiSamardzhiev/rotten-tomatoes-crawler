Yet, if you're willing to give something outside the norm a try, or you're a fan of the of the original and can get past the idea that remaking it would be sacrilege, I highly recommend it", "If you can make it through to the other side, you'll experience one of the most ambitious, fleshy, though-provoking horror films in recent memory.", "I distinguish a certain plasticity in the images, but also little substance and a very extensive length. At least, Thom Yorke's brilliant soundtrack helps me forget the result. [Full review in Spanish]", "Suspiria is a stunning cinematic masterwork that is, like all the best horror, both visually mesmerizing and profoundly unsettling.", "[A] stunningly crafted horror classic.", "A film with some interesting ideas left adrift, like dancers on a stage that's far too large for them to move across efficiently.", "A film that tries to be as experimental as its namesake but botches its storytelling and pacing decisions.", "In creating its own curious mix of history, supernaturalism, queerness and style, the film deserves to be celebrated as an original, truly fearless piece of cinema.", "Yet, despite the fantastical, nightmare images, this remake ultimately seems to be more of an exercise in filmmaking than storytelling.", "Suspiria is equal parts alienating and hypnotic", "I think the film has loads of potential, but is too bloated as of now.", "It's dark, tense, and oozes of evil.", "Suspiria is nothing if not ambitious, but when a film tackles such a broad swath of heavy topics, it becomes difficult to treat each one with the weight it deserves."], "rating": ["", "", "3/5", "3.5/4", "4/5", "4.5/5", "5/10", "", "", "6/10", "", "", "", "5/10", "", "", "", "", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Fletcher Powell", "Dennis Harvey", "Jason Best", "Richard Propes", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Matt Cipolla", "Alex Hudson", "Damond Fudge", "Steven Prokopy", "Yasser Medina", "Dan Tabor", "Dan Scully", "Dan Schindel", "Julian Lytle", "Zhuo-Ning Su", "Jeff York", "Hannah Lodge", "Sarah Musnicky", "Karl Delossantos", "Oscar Goff"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KMUW - Wichita Public Radio", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">48 Hills", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Movie Talk", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TheIndependentCritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Confessions From A Geek Mind", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Monthly", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Exclaim!", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">KCCI (Des Moines, IA)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Third Coast Review", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinemaficionados", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Phawker", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Cinema76", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Hyperallergic", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">idobi.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Awards Daily", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Creative Screenwriting", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Beat", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Legion of Leia at Vital Thrills", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Smash Cut Reviews", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Boston Hassle"], "date": ["February 9, 2021", "October 22, 2020", "October 19, 2020", "September 24, 2020", "August 27, 2020", "July 25, 2020", "July 18, 2020", "July 17, 2020", "July 1, 2020", "June 27, 2020", "May 29, 2020", "March 18, 2020", "February 18, 2020", "January 10, 2020", "October 23, 2019", "October 18, 2019", "September 27, 2019", "September 18, 2019", "August 1, 2019", "July 24, 2019"]}}
