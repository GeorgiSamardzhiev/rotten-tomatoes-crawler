{"metadata": {"synopsis": "After unsuccessfully trying his luck in Hollywood, charming gigolo Chance Wayne (Paul Newman) wanders back to his hometown, accompanied by Alexandra Del Lago (Geraldine Page), a movie star on the wane. Chance quickly falls back into his old rut -- he's still smitten with his former sweetheart, Heavenly Finley (Shirley Knight), but her thuggish brother (Rip Torn) and her crooked politician father (Ed Begley) both hate him. When Alexandra leaves town, Chance is left with little more than trouble.", "rating": "74", "genre": "Classics/Drama", "runtime": "2h", "director": "Richard Brooks", "studio": "RoxburyProductions", "theater_date": "Mar 21, 1962", "dvd_date": "Nov 21, 2016", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Here are Paul and Shirley playing true love gone wrong (in the shape of two pretty stupid types), while Geraldine portrays fallen grandeur with superb dash.", "The play is all broad strokes, and even worse, the film does its damndest to sanitize them.", "Once again, Hollywood proved to be more constrictive than Broadway -- a shocking castration gets replaced by a savage beating -- but the Southern discomfort of its characters keeps this torrid melodrama humming.", "Page and Newman are fantastic.", "It's a glossy, engrossing hunk of motion picture entertainment, slickly produced by Berman.", "All of Williams's Southern Gothic themes are intermingled here: violence, familial conflict, sexual neurosis, the mentality of the mob. Most of it comes across as overheated nonsense.", "Offers little indication of what made the original play interesting (especially in Elia Kazan's stage production), despite the fact that Paul Newman and Geraldine Page are called on to reprise their original roles.", "Strong cast (Newman, Page) in deeply dramatic Williams drama.", "There is no clearer face for the conflict and despondency of the decade of the sixties than Newman's magnificent bastards.", "When approaching 1962's Sweet Bird of Youth, go for the parts rather than the whole.... [T]he film is a long drive through swampy melodrama.", "The film gets a little bogged down in minutiae and irrelevant side plots, but on the whole it's solid and searing.", "In 1962, the film was deemed audacious due to its handling of such taboo issues as drugs, abortion, and degeneracy, but it's a comromised work which deviates substantially from Tennessee Williams' play.", "", "Newman and Page elevate Williams' melodramatic romance.", "Brooks' direction seems a little too stolid for all the sleazy, flaming passions. These are, however, given full measure by an excellent cast.", "", "", "This cynical, coruscating drama has a strong look of being contrived, and Mr. Brooks' happy ending for it is implausible and absurd.", "Newman began his splendid career on stage and returned triumphantly to Broadway to star in Williams' play about a gigolo with acting ambitions who attaches himself to an aging movie star."], "rating": ["", "", "3/4", "", "", "2.5/4", "", "5/5", "3/4", "2/4", "3.5/5", "B", "3/5", "4/5", "", "5/5", "2/5", "2/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh"], "critic": ["Janet Graves", "Otis Stuart", "Matt Brunson", "", "Variety Staff", "", "Jonathan Rosenbaum", "Steve Crum", "Walter Chaw", "Mark Bourne", "Christopher Null", "Emanuel Levy", "Jake Euker", "Carol Cling", "Tom Milne", "Susan Granger", "Chuck O&#39;Leary", "Bosley Crowther", "Film4 Staff"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Photoplay", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">OutWeek", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Frenzy", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Empire Magazine", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Variety", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">TV Guide", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Chicago Reader", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Video-Reviewmaster.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film Freak Central", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">DVDJournal.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Filmcritic.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">EmanuelLevy.Com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">F5 (Wichita, KS)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Las Vegas Review-Journal", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">www.susangranger.com", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Fantastica Daily", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">New York Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Film4"], "date": ["December 15, 2020", "May 20, 2020", "May 16, 2020", "April 8, 2008", "April 8, 2008", "April 8, 2008", "April 8, 2008", "February 22, 2008", "July 11, 2006", "May 7, 2006", "May 6, 2006", "April 28, 2006", "March 9, 2006", "February 10, 2006", "February 9, 2006", "December 21, 2005", "October 9, 2005", "May 9, 2005", "May 24, 2003"]}}
