Allow the inversion to pull you along because it does, for the most part, make sense by the end.", "Huge scale, gripping and ambitious sci-fi spy thriller from Christopher Nolan, which simply has to be seen to be believed, and possibly seen more than once to be fully appreciated.", "It's the most Nolan movie ever and I'm not sure it makes since but I was enthralled nonetheless.", "The future is now or in the past", "Nolan's obsession with making his films as complex as humanly possible is frustrating for those of us who would like at least a scintilla of clarity in our storytelling.", "Washington and Pattinson have palpable charisma, but this cold puzzle offers no incentive to solve it. Throw in damsel-in-distress crap, and both my geek sensibilities and my feminism are offended.", "Something like the epitome of [Nolan's] temporally twisty canon, distilling his many cinematic signatures and preoccupations down to their entrancing abstract essence.", "Nolan's reverence for tech and the cleverness of pulling off a metaphysical narrative puzzle finally swamps his awareness of whether the thing in question is even any good.", "The trippy last hour is jam packed with artfully arranged action scenes that manipulate time in increasingly psychedelic ways.", "Tenet has its moments, but is easily Nolan's worst film. Mostly incomprehensible; this muddled sci-fi thriller is a long way from being the \"savior of cinema.\" Honestly, it'd be difficult to recommend even if we weren't in the middle of a pandemic.", "Tenet asks for patience as it winds forward and backward through its narrative accordion structure...savor, even [its] flaws.", "...'Tenet' makes 'Inception' feel like a children's story. The film is magnificently and perhaps quite purposefully confusing.", "Tenet isn't here to collect Oscars. It exists to pummel you with excitement, twist your sense of reality, and leave you confounded with the deafening power of its nine-figure budget.", "The weakest of Nolan's 11 cinematic at-bats to date, Tenet finds the filmmaker unable to get out of his own way as he attempts to spin a yarn that makes earlier efforts like Memento seem as linear and uncomplicated as A Charlie Brown Christmas.", "I love Tenet so much, despite its frustrations. Nolan wants to keep pushing the boundaries of these kinds of blockbusters, and that means he's going to fail as much as he succeeds.", "Tenet is a Christopher Nolan film in every way. An amalgamation of themes & threads out of his other films combined into one, Tenet has shades of Nolan's best work, but not without flaws.", "A science fiction film in which Nolan builds, visually, a twisted and frenetic experience of international espionage that is structured as if it were a narrative palindrome of dualities and retrocausality. [Full review in Spanish]", "It's an audiovisual experience that no movie lover should miss. Stimulating, revealing, adrenaline-pumping and spectacular, this is Christopher Nolan's new proposal. [Full review in Spanish]", "Visually dazzling but absolutely incomprehensible and impenetrable...", "Less of a puzzle and more like a mechanical bull.
