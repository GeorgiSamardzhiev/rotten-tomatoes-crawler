The Boys in the Band gets the job done, but it doesn't always get it right.", "The 2020 version of The Boys in the Band is in a many ways a history lesson as much as it is a compelling queer drama, but there is nothing dry about it.", "Poignant, timely and fabulously executed by an all-star cast and timeless script from Mart Crowley with unforgettable performances from Jim Parsons and Robin de Jesus", "It's definitely of its time, and this [remake] doesn't try to reimagine or update it... But it shows how far we've come on LGBTQ issues in 50 years. It also shows us how far we need to go.", "Boys is sometimes expertly structured and at other times a wobbly mess.", "It's the cast the kept me hooked, though. Having worked together on stage, the actors bring a strong lived-in feeling to their interplay, but they don't need to project into a theater. They can blend effortlessly.", "Sharply directed, the story unfolds in real time in one location. Much of what is said is downright cruel, but this is a rare script that confronts enormous issues without flinching.", "Play-based drama has language and nudity.", "The Boys in the Band was important in its time, and while it shows its age in spots...it's a meaningful artistic and cultural document, reflective of a time and place both drastically different from and shockingly similar to now.", "The Boys in the Band might be a classic text, but even with this new production, it feels more like a museum exhibit than a vibrant account of the past."], "rating": ["3.5/5", "7/10", "3/5", "", "3/5", "3/5", "B", "3.5/4", "", "", "", "3.5/5", "", "", "", "", "4/5", "2/5", "4/5", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Bianca Garner", "Jennifer Heaton", "Tim Robey", "Shah Shahid", "Clarisse Loughrey", "K.
