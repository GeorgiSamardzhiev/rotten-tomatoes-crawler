The carnage is massive and the unflinching brutality of the fighting includes some hard-to-watch scenes where soldiers are forced at gunpoint by a sadistic commander to execute prisoners.", "The benefit is a quite overwhelming, palpable realism.", "It serves as a big-budget corrective to myths about war generated by Western cinema, such as the idea that Asians stood by to watch while Westerners fight their battles.", "There's never a dull moment over the long running time.", "The absence of any well-developed characters makes The Eight Hundred a hollow experience, and one which only delivers a long two and a half hours of empty sound and fury.", "A towering technical achievement which commands attention from start to finish.", "The Eight Hundred bites off more that it can chew but it consistently serves up gripping filmmaking on the biggest canvas.", "\"The Eight Hundred\" fetishizes martyrdom, but for those seeking big-screen, epic violence, it's pretty much the only game in town.", "Guan goes hammer and tongs with the special effects, delivering stupendously, joint-rattlingly-loud battle scenes and combat sequences edited to the lightning pace of a superhero movie.", "\"An excellent film filled with real emotion, real bravery and real reactions that showcases the complexities of men faced with near-certain death.\"", "We watch them stand for their country amid the gore-soaked horror of war, with action filmed up close, with amazing aerial shots, and inside various environments that dazzle the eyes.", "\"Overall, the film is still worth a watch if you're interested in Chinese history and politics. If the political message doesn't interest you, at least The Eight Hundred has decent special effects amidst explosions and gun battles.\"", "The Eight Hundred is a great story depicting the Chinese front.", "The Eight Hundred is thin on characterization, and too often slips into rote narrative and war movie cliches.", "Digging past the surface morale boosting, you will find a darker story.", "An entertaining, thought at times taxing, experience that succeeds at once as being a distinctive yet conventional entrant in the war film genre.", "[A]t least those who like blunt metaphors with their war movies will get a kick out of Hu's most blatant device: a majestic white horse that the NRA lets gallop through the warehouse as if rubber-stamped with the words \"hope.\"", "At its heart, The Eight Hundred is the kind of rousing war story we're used to seeing out of Britain and America, full of heroism, sacrifice, and baby-faced soldiers who go beyond the call of duty.", "A film with ambitions as wide as the screen it should be seen on, it uses expert craftsmanship to tell a story of war heroism and patriotism that is both intimately familiar and somehow foreign to U.S. audiences"], "rating": ["3.5/5", "2.5/5", "", "3.5/5", "3.5/5", "2/5", "", "4/5", "", "3/5", "9.0/10", "3.5/5", "", "8.5/10", "", "", "3/5", "2.5/4", "3/5", "B+"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["James Marsh", "Jim Schembri", "Diane Carson", "John Lui", "Rich Cline", "James Mudge", "John Berra", "Ian Freer", "Michael Ordo\u00f1a", "Cath Clarke", "Vincent Schilling", "Linda Cook", "Richard Yu", "Alan Ng", "Elizabeth Kerr", "Daniel Eagan", "Peter Gray", "Barry Hertz", "Chris Knight", "J.
