He got to make things bigger, both physically and in terms of the ideas at play.", "If A New Hope is the body of Star Wars, Empire can lay pretty good claim to being its soul.", "That story counts for less than gimmicks, and characters less than both, might be judged from the lack of resonance in the one narrative revelation, concerning Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker.", "Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is arguably one of the three greatest Star Wars films heading into The Rise of Skywalker.", "An indubitable classic, not only of its genre but of the seventh art in general. [Full Review in Spanish]", "The Empire Strikes Back Displays the same soaring imagination that made Star Wars a filmmaking classic; most other space movies seem clunky and earthbound in comparison.", "Seeing the arc of Luke's daddy issues culminate at the end of The Empire Strikes Back blew everyone's mind.", "The special effects are great and the writing is poignant, funny, emotional, everything you could want in a movie.", "Among the best sci-fi ... anything... ever. It has a darker tone, but still has plenty of fun, I'd have no problem putting it on and watching it all over again.", "A tight story, incredible twists, great characters and crunching action scenes, all tied up with a terrific ending - if you don't believe so, that is why you fail.", "This is a respectable sequel to Star Wars but not as good.", "Topping the most successful act in show business history is an impossibility, of course. But that's the challenge facing everyone who worked on \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" They have succeeded to an altogether remarkable extent.", "The best 'Star Wars' film, an exciting and thrilling adventure, but also a sober and complex picture. [Full Review in Spanish]", "Has any movie sequel ever so thoroughly surpassed impossible expectations as The Empire Strikes Back?", "...an erratically-paced yet consistently entertaining installment in a not-quite-great sci-fi series.", "The Empire Strikes Back is no bland derivative. It has all the freshness and exuberance of an original. A marvellous space fantasy full of dazzling spectacle, exciting adventure, strange creatures and the mythic clash between good and evil.", "The Empire Strikes Back is the ultimate in fantasies, a visual wonder and a movie that should be recommended highly if only because it makes you feel good.", "Despite a couple of drawbacks, the Empire Strikes Back is an immense amount of fun -- big and splashy and breathtaking in its display of cinematic genius by a huge group of marvelously talented people.", "To answer the big question first: Yes, The Empire Strikes Back is just as enjoyable as Star Wars. In fact, this is one sequel that defies tradition by being better than the original on several counts -- most of them technical, but a few dramatic."], "rating": ["1", "4/4", "9/10", "", "5/5", "", "", "", "A+", "5/5", "9.5/10", "", "", "4/4", "9/10", "3/4", "", "", "", ""], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Mike Massie", "Alan French", "Joshua Starnes", "Richard Combs", "Danielle Solzman", "Sergio Ben\u00edtez", "Bob Thomas", "C.J.
