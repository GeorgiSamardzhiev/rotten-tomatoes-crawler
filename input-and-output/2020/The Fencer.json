A cinematic triumph from a nation that's been missing from the global film stage.", "Unfortunately, being a sincere, heartfelt true story isn't enough to recommend this film. One can only hope that someone more skilled will someday tell this story in a more compelling fashion.", "It's surprising how polite and restrained everything is. However, that doesn't mean you won't be wiping your eyes as the credits start to roll.", "Adeptly directed by Finnish filmmaker Klaus Haro, who emphasizes the hope and pride his protagonist inspires in his young students, this is a smooth sail of a movie too enjoyable to be doomed by its formulaic presentation of deserving material.", "Although somewhat boxed in by its own physical beauty, The Fencer is so uniformly well-crafted, it should be shown in film schools as a model of technical artists operating at the highest level.", "Klaus Hr's The Fencer straddles the line between the inspirational sports coach and postwar intrigue genres, and while it isn't a tournament-winning example of either form, it has a steady stance and hits most of the expected targets.", "Basically a \"Hoosiers\" remake ... but that's OK. It's a winner here, too.", "An effective mix of underdog sports drama and political thriller, inspired by the true-life story of celebrated fencing champ Endel Nelis.", "Built to be an audience-pleaser, and it's successful in that respect, delivering a level of benevolence that's immensely appealing.", "Not awful, just uninspired.", "Though the camera follows Endel closely, we never really get inside his head - or explore the fear, regret and uncertainty that must plague him.", "... an awkward mix of sports underdog saga and political thriller, yet even when its edges are soft instead of sharp, the crowd-pleasing result provides depth and historical insight.", "The Fencer is respectable, well-acted and ultimately heartwarming, but it's also forgettable.", "Throughout the film, Hr vividly captures a sense of the late Stalinist-era paranoia, as well as the drabness of Soviet life in general. It is also engaging on a human level. These are reserved people, but when they make a connection, it is meaningful.", "A celebration of the ethical goodness and heroic acts of a teacher."], "rating": ["", "", "3.5/4", "3/4", "3/4", "4/5", "", "4/5", "3/4", "", "", "3/4", "", "B", "1/5", "1.5/4", "", "2.5/4", "4/5", "4/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["Steven Prokopy", "Dan Scully", "Sarah Knight Adamson", "Josh Terry", "Sean P.
