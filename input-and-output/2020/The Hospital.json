Scott), the chief of medicine in a New York City teaching hospital, is contemplating suicide; he's impotent, his wife has left him, and his children aren't speaking to him. His hospital is also suffering from a recent spate of inexplicable deaths. In the midst of these setbacks, Bock is romantically drawn to the much younger Barbara (Diana Rigg), whose father is a patient. As Barbara restores Bock's will to live, it turns out that the hospital deaths are murders.", "rating": "100", "genre": "Classics/Comedy/Drama", "runtime": "1h 44m", "director": "Arthur Hiller", "studio": "SimchaProductions", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "Jan 26, 2017", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["It will have you pondering the effectiveness of the American healthcare system, one that hasn't changed (too) much since '71.", "This darkly humorous satire of an urban hospital is probably the only decent movie that Arthur Hiller had directed, benefiting from Chayefsky's Oscar winning script.", "", "It was hard to come out of The Hospital feeling all that well.", "", "Another towering performance by the great George C.
