{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Laura (Bel\u00e9n Rueda) has happy memories of her childhood in an orphanage. She convinces her husband to buy the place and help her convert it into a home for sick children. One day, her own adopted son, Sim\u00f3n (Roger Pr\u00edncep), disappears. Simon is critically ill, and when he is still missing several months later, he is presumed dead.

[Full review in Spanish]", "Bayona never resorts to gore and prefers an approach based on the carefully built up suspense found in classic Hitchcock films; and much like Hitchcock, the story is based on a very viable Freudian premise.", "The less you know of this film, the more you'll be surprised, shocked and, in the end, satisfied.", "There are no monsters, or slashers, and yet the movie got under my skin so much so that it left me shaky as I walked out of the theater.", "Though The Orphanage sticks fairly closely to a genre fomat, and the plot twists become a little predictable, the film packs surprises all the way to the end.", "Let the anticipation of Bayona's next move begin.", "By the time we reach the third act, this is less a horror film but a psychological study of a protagonist on the brink of emotional collapse.", "A frightening movie that earns its scares the hard way, generating unbearable tension through artful technique instead of computer.", "Spanish director JA Bayona's debut feature is an exceptionally effective and surprisingly moving ghost story that seasons its horror with a pervasive sense of grief.", "The horror genre is not often known for its subtlety, but The Orphanage proves that sometimes it's more satisfying to squirm in your seat than it is to jump out of it.", "This Guillermo del Toro-produced Spanish spook-'em-up re-opens the door to the chilly, bracing air of the old-school ghost story.", "As director Juan Antonio Bayona proves with his astonishing feature debut, you don't need a rusty scalpel to reveal the inner workings of the human heart.", "This is a movie whose power and emotional pitch lie in the understated: the discreet performances, the lack of special effects, the laconic script.", "Bayona is a skilled technician, but seek elsewhere if you're hoping for the transporting originality of last year's Pan's Labyrinth.", "Spanish horror films have a rich, still underappreciated tradition, but The Orphanage could have been made by any anonymous Hollywood hack", "However, the creative trust hasn&rsquo;t forgotten those who love their art served up rich in metaphor and message.", "[A] pungent and scary film.", "The Orphanage is simply content with getting through the entire story without tripping over its own flaws, and though it's definitely better than most supernatural thrillers, it doesn't belong in the same camp as del Toro or any of his films."], "rating": ["4/5", "", "4/5", "", "", "A-", "", "", "4/5", "", "3/5", "4/5", "4/5", "4.5/5", "", "2/4", "", "5/5", "4/5", "2/5"], "fresh": ["fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Kaleem Aftab", "Hannah Ryan", "Laura Hiros", "Emine Yildirim", "Philip French", "Nate Deen", "Katey Rich", "Eric Kohn", "Michael Bonner", "Peter Travers", "Adam Smith", "Ali Gray", "", "Steve Newton", "Maria M.
