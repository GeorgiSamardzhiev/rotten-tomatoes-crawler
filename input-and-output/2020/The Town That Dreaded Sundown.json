There's no other explanation for the woeful stupidity of some of the characters' actions and the blandness of the dialogue.", "While its tone wildly varies, when it comes to the glut of horror remakes, it's a slight step ahead of the standard batch.", "Knowledge of the first film probably helps, but it's a nifty little genre experiment nonetheless.", "With its small-town atmospherics, a juicy supporting cast of character players, plus Addison Timlin's personable, plucky \"final girl\", this Town is pulled off with polished, enjoyable brashness ...", "This is an exercise in nostalgia as much as bloodletting. The filmmakers are paying their very own tribute to teen-horror pics of the 1970s.", "Not a straight remake of the 1976 cult horror movie, The Town That Dreaded Sundown is more a self-referential homage that takes the original film's legacy and embellishes it.", "A straightforward, slickly edited psycho-killer flick with moments of razor-sharp tension and a welcome appearance from Alien star Veronica Cartwright as Timlin's granny.", "Those who like their shivers served up with a spattering of grey matter should leave with a sunny disposition.", "It's an odd, if somewhat original, way of playing with sequel conventions: the plot exists in a reality where the original film also exists. But outside of knowing winks, this is cookie cutter carnage.", "Clever enough, but forgets to be exciting.", "A film that bounds towards the cult appeal of those self-reflexive horror classics, but agonisingly doesn't quite stick the landing.", "This isn't only another rote slasher movie, full of ridiculous coincidences and obvious red herrings: it's actually worse than that, yet thinks it's clever.", "After a strong start, it's unfortunate that the director's efforts and fun cinematic trimmings are ultimately stymied by a narrative that gradually runs out of steam before the same old stalk and slash machinations are wheeled out.", "A clever concept and stylish execution (in both senses) aren't quite enough to make this achingly meta remake/reboot/sequel stand out from the slasher pack.", "It's too late to reinvent this wheel but there's no denying Gomez-Rejon's given it one hell of a spin.", "Offers something more complex and intriguing than a straightforward trudge through the events of the original.", "It's self-aware and funny, and packed with veterans who are all having a good time.", "Dutch angles, dual-focus, dream sequences and at least one belting tracking shot invoke B-movie masters in a film that's way more stylish and thoughtful than one might expect.", "...a misguided endeavor that's often far too self-referential for its own good..."], "rating": ["", "2/5", "C+", "3/5", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "2/5", "2/5", "3/5", "", "2/5", "3/5", "4/5", "3/5", "3/5", "4/5", "2/4"], "fresh": ["rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten"], "critic": ["Joe Lipsett", "John Bleasdale", "Bill Graham", "Alistair Harkness", "Jonathan Romney", "Geoffrey Macnab", "Wendy Ide", "Jeremy Aspinall", "Rob Daniel", "Benjamin Lee", "David Jenkins", "Robbie Collin", "MaryAnn Johanson", "Adam Lowes", "Tom Huddleston", "Matt Glasby", "Henry Northmore", "Jonathan Hatfull", "Chris Fyvie", "David Nusair"], "publisher": ["data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Bloody Disgusting", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">CineVue", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Film Stage", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Scotsman", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Observer (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Independent (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Times (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Radio Times", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Sky Cinema", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Guardian", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Little White Lies", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Daily Telegraph (UK)", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Flick Filosopher", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">HeyUGuys", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Time Out", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Total Film", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The List", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">SciFiNow", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">The Skinny", "data-qa=\"review-critic-publication\">Reel Film Reviews"], "date": ["February 22, 2020", "April 4, 2019", "March 2, 2016", "April 20, 2015", "April 19, 2015", "April 16, 2015", "April 16, 2015", "April 16, 2015", "April 16, 2015", "April 16, 2015", "April 16, 2015", "April 16, 2015", "April 15, 2015", "April 15, 2015", "April 13, 2015", "April 13, 2015", "April 13, 2015", "April 10, 2015", "February 20, 2015", "February 16, 2015"]}}
