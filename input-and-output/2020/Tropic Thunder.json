{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Tugg Speedman (Ben Stiller), pampered action superstar, sets out for Southeast Asia to take part in the biggest, most-expensive war movie produced, but soon after filming begins, he and his co-stars, Oscar-winner Kirk Lazarus (Robert Downey Jr.), comic Jeff Portnoy (Jack Black) and the rest of the crew, must become real soldiers when fighting breaks out in that part of the jungle.", "rating": "82", "genre": "Comedy", "runtime": "1h 47m", "director": "Ben Stiller", "studio": "RedHourFilms,DreamWorksSKG", "theater_date": "Aug 13, 2008", "dvd_date": "Aug 1, 2013", "box_office": "$110.4M"}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Because of the lack of a strong theme or point of view, unwittingly perhaps, the film becomes a version of the phenomenon it set out to parody: an action film, even a semi-patriotic action film.", "Egregious amounts of violence crop up, but they're mitigated by the constant silliness surrounding them.", "This no-holds-barred send-up of Hollywood pomposity and folly flaunts its tastelessness and flouts taboos with a brazen recklessness.", "Easily Stiller's best film in quite some time and yet another testament to Stiller's gifts as a filmmaker.", "It's clear the cast is really enjoying itself, making something special...I loved what was happening.", "This movie makes me laugh so hard.", "Tropic Thunder exaggerates on its eccentricity, but it's always dealt with a sense of satirical truth. That in itself develops the film beyond any throwaway comedy that is trying too hard to find that punchline.", "A cast to die for, and one of the truly hysterical and irreverent films of the past few decades.", "The real lasting appeal of Tropic Thunder won't be the lavish production, but the rich send-up of acting as a profession, Hollywood as a culture, and war films as an inspiration to us civilians.", "Tropic Thunder has to be one of the smartest films of the year about Hollywood and the business, with a script that isn't afraid to poke fun at itself.", "Tropic Thunder looks like it's been plotted by a child... but most of the time you'll be laughing too hard to notice, or care.", "If you haven't seen Tropic Thunder yet, go now. There are scenes in it so hilarious the whole audience goes into laugh-convulsions for minutes at a time", "[Tropic Thunder] will probably set the bar for over-the-top humor for years to come.", "Always worth a look for its all-star cast of funnymen - led by Ben Stiller, Jack Black, Robert Downey Jr. and (yes, he really is funny here) Tom Cruise.", "Tropic Thunder was post-everything, including entertainment. It's a white boy version of a Wayans Brothers movie, made long after satirizing Vietnam war films could possibly matter.", "The bulk of this movie, alas, comes down to weak sketches held together by ridiculous action, vast explosions and more or less everything else it should be parodying.", "Given the incoherence of its satirical aspirations (the film does end with a suggestion that everyone involved still loves this business we call show), and finally too scattershot to really make it as parody, Tropic Thunder is best appreciated as a goof.", "More exhausting than funny, though it is often both, Ben Stiller's latest excoriation of ego wears you down with its smothering, pop-savvy cynicism.", "Tropic Thunder pushes more buttons than most comedies dare.", "Tropic Thunder is probably the best war-movie spoof of all time, playing around with all those cliches and conventions we've seen a million times before."], "rating": ["", "7/10", "", "3.5/4", "5/5", "5/5", "4/5", "3/4", "", "B+", "4/5", "", "", "3/5", "", "", "", "", "3/4", "5/5"], "fresh": ["rotten", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "fresh", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "rotten", "fresh", "fresh"], "critic": ["David Walsh", "Mike Massie", "Jason Best", "Richard Propes", "Justin Brown", "Brandon Collins", "Kelechi Ehenulo", "Tom Meek", "Ed Travis", "Micheal Compton", "Kaleem Aftab", "Eileen Jones", "Marcianne Miller", "Leigh Paatsch", "A.S.
