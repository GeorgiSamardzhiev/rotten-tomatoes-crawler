{"metadata": {"synopsis": "Zorro, the legendary swordsman, has passed on his weapon and his sense of duty to his noble son, Diego (George Hamilton), a dashing swashbuckler like his father. But after an injury sidelines Diego, he is forced to hand the mask over to his flamboyantly gay twin, Ramon (also Hamilton), who prefers to be called Bunny Wigglesworth. While Ramon agrees to take on the guise of Zorro, he decides to add his own flair, with garishly glittering costumes -- and a whip in place of the iconic sword.", "rating": "43", "genre": "Action & Adventure/Comedy", "runtime": "1h 33m", "director": "Peter Medak", "studio": "20thCenturyFox", "theater_date": "", "dvd_date": "", "box_office": ""}, "reviews": {"reviews": ["Tasteless, forced comedy just about killed the Zorro franchise for many years.", "", "", "", "This movie is, of course, intended as a comedy, and it has some funny moments.
